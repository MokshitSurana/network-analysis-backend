","Great Britain has imposed sanctions against the head of Sputnik news agency, Anton Anisimov. London has also slapped sanctions against the ""Rossiya Segodnya"" International News Agency. Sanctions have also been imposed against journalist and TV presenter Sergey Brilev, Managing Director of RT Alexey Nikolov, and former head of the Russian communications watchdog Aleksandr Zharov. ""Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has announced 14 new sanctions today (Thursday 31 March) on Russian propagandists and state media who spread lies and deceit about [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine,"" the government said in a statement. According to a document released by Britain, the head of the National Defence Management Centre of the Russian Federation Mikhail Mizintsev has been sanctioned as well.  Anisimov said he cheered up when he learned about the sanctions being imposed against him. Since the beginning of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, Britain has imposed several packages of sanctions against Russia, targeting the country's financial institutions and individuals' bank accounts in Britain. In addition to economic measures, London banned Russian ships from UK ports.  Russia started its special operation in Ukraine following calls from the country's breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk to protect their civilians amid intensified shelling by Kiev's forces. According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, another key goal of the operation is to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine, where numerous radical neo-Nazi battalions have been actively participating in the Donbass conflict, presenting a threat to the Russian-speaking civilian population.

Both Russia and Ukraine have been under the “Level 4 – Do Not Travel” US advisory for over a year, on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. In his introductory remarks, Price did not elaborate on “reports” that led the US government to announce the change. The only American known to have been detained by Russian authorities in recent weeks is the WNBA basketball star Brittney Griner. Griner was arrested on February 17 – a week prior to the escalation of hostilities in Ukraine – at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport, for possession of illegal narcotics. A drug-sniffing dog alerted to her luggage and police found carrying cannabis oil cartridges for a vaporizer inhaler, according to the Russian police. Griner has been charged with drug smuggling, and a court ordered her held in jail until May 19."

Instead, Delhi has called for a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis.","Dozens of members of the Hindu Sena, a Hindu organisation, took out a march in the Gwalior district of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh on Thursday in support of Russia amid its ongoing military operation in Ukraine. Hindu Sena's national president, Vishnu Gupta, and other members criticised Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and said he is the enemy of his own country. Condemning Kiev authorities for handing out weapons to civilians ""to fight their fascist war"", Gupta said that Zelensky ""keeps asking for more and more weapons but not once has he appealed for humanitarian aid for the Ukrainians"". ""The Ukrainian military has killed Russian officers and their negotiator, and yet they call themselves the victims. So far, Ukrainians don't seem to show any intention of stopping the war,"" Gupta said. The members were holding placards in support of Russia and India-Russia relations along with the national flags of the two countries. Gupta blamed the US and his allies for escalating the situation ""by unnecessarily interfering in two countries' bilateral ties"". ""The western world and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) must stop their proxy war against Russia endangering the civilian population of Ukraine and Russia."" The Hindu Sena's national president also accused Ukrainian authorities of blackmail as India had abstained from voting on a US-sponsored UN Security Council resolution that condemned Russia's special operation in February. ""India or any other country abstaining from voting, as a sovereign nation, has every right to take a stand according to its interests and relationship and no country or its citizens have the right to humiliate and beat up other citizens. It was very disturbing to see the Ukraine representative at the UNSC meeting openly arm-twisting and blackmailing India by holding our students hostage, so we vote in their favour. Later, many media reports surfaced of discrimination and humiliation in the FACIST &amp; RACIST Ukraine. There are also reports of shooting foreign students trying to leave Ukraine,"" he said. Indian students that were stuck in different parts of Ukraine accused Ukrainian security forces and border officials of racist treatment as they attempted to flee the country. ""No media is talking about Ukraine changing its constitution to exclude the Russian-speaking population and is doing ethnic cleansing of Russians in Ukraine, something that western media has wrongfully accused India of doing in Kashmir for years."" Gupta said that western media has consistently spread pro-Ukraine propaganda and fake news against Russia. He also stressed that Russia has every right to take necessary action to safeguard its borders, adding that India will always support Russia, ""as Russia has always been a true friend of India"". On 24 February, Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine after the newly recognised breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian aggression. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had made the tough decision to start the operation to stop the genocide of the Donbass population which the Kiev regime had been waging for eight years. "

The head of the Norwegian Intelligence Service, Nils Andreas Stensønes, ventured that Putin is under pressure amid the conflict in Ukraine, sanctions from the West and unrest among the oligarchs, but nevertheless has no challengers. According to Stensønes, it is difficult to estimate whether Vladimir Putin has strengthened or weakened his position as a result of Russia's special operation in Ukraine, citing a diminished presence of Western media and less access to credible information. Stensønes concluded that it is generally difficult to judge the stability of what he called a “closed regime”. Vladimir Putin has been Russia's president since 2012, and was previously president from 2000 until 2008. He also served as the country's prime minister from 1999 to 2000, and again from 2008 to 2012. As of now, Putin is the second-longest currently-serving European leader after Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus. Russia and its allies from the newly recognised Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics began a military operation in Ukraine on the morning of 24 February. The operation followed nearly eight years of harrowing civil conflict in the Donbass and came in the aftermath of weeks of escalating tensions as Ukrainian forces conducted sabotage and sniper attacks as well as shelled Donbass forces. Earlier in March, the Russian military released documents indicating that Kiev had planned to conduct a full-scale attack on the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. "

While Washington initially tried to deny their existence, they later confirmed it, but claimed the labs’ activities were unremarkable.","The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) revealed new documents on Thursday that had been seized by Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, including correspondences between American financier Hunter Biden - the son of US President Joe Biden - and figures involved in biological research in Ukraine, which an investment firm of his helped to bankroll. The emails revealed the names of several American figures central to the biological research projects from the firms Metabiota and Black &amp; Veatch, as well as officials from the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Those named include: Pope was deputy director of operations, readiness and exercises at the DTRA from 2017 until 2020. He previously held various positions at US Air Force European Command (USAFE), US Central Command (USCC), and the Pentagon. Pope participated in the development of radiochemical procedures for monitoring international treaties in the field of nuclear weapons (Air Force Technical Application Center). The published emails revealed a correspondence between Pope and Ukraine’s acting health minister between 2016 and 2019, American-born Ulana Suprun, who went to Ukraine to participate in the US-backed coup in 2014. Williams took over for Pope as acting DTRA director in 2020, having previously been the agency’s director of development, test and evaluation. He led the Department of Defense’s program to develop capabilities to detect, locate and neutralize foreign WMD and improvised explosive devices. Williams also served as Assistant Deputy Administrator for Nonproliferation at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the US Department of Energy, the organization responsible for the country’s nuclear weapons arsenal. Wintrol headed DTRA projects in Ukraine until 2021 at the US Embassy in Kiev’s Defense Threat Reduction Office. Emails published by the MoD revealed she directly supervised experiments with deadly pathogens, including the UP-2 Project for “mapping highly infectious diseases in Ukraine,” including anthrax; the UP-4 Project, described as a “risk assessment of particularly dangerous pathogens transmitted by birds in Ukraine during migration”; the UP-8 Project studying “spread of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and hantaviruses in Ukraine and the potential need for differential diagnosis of patients with suspected leptospirosis. Previously released documents showed she also oversaw Project P-782, conducting research into the transmission of diseases through bats. Wintrol moved to Chemical Security and Elimination (CSE) in early 2021. According to a DTRA publication, CSE was formerly known as the Chemical Weapons Elimination (CWE) program and the Chemical Weapons Destruction (CWD) program. The effort “started in 1992 to build the capacity of the states of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) to reduce the threat from chemical weapons (CW) by securing and eliminating CW stockpiles, chemical research capabilities, and production facilities, while also redirecting scientists to peaceful purposes,” the agency said. Since 2013, Edwards has been the CEO of American engineering firm Black &amp; Veatch, a longtime contractor for the Pentagon used for a variety of construction tasks. He has been with the company since 1978 and was formerly its Chief Operating Officer. Black &amp; Veatch was long known to be working on Pentagon projects in Ukraine, but the documents seized by Russian forces earlier this month revealed the firm’s job in overseeing biological programs there, including the UP-8 project previously mentioned, studying Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, leptospirosis and hantaviruses. He has been the project manager in Ukraine for Black &amp; Veatch since 2011 and its biological project coordinator. In August 2021, he told the Kansas City Business Journal that his work on airborne biological agents in Ukraine had helped Black &amp; Veatch to develop a device for purifying air of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, the virus that causes COVID-19. Lippencott is a graduate of the US Army Military Academy at West Point. In one of the documents published by the MoD, a report from the Security Service of Ukraine’s Kherson region referred to “a potential threat to the epidemiological and epizootic situation in our country that has recently come to light as a result of DTRA’s intentions through Black &amp; Veatch to establish control over the functioning of Ukrainian microbiological laboratories that conduct research into particularly dangerous pathogens that can be used to create or upgrade new types of biological weapons.” Another document from Lippencott to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense concerns the extension of the UP-8 project mentioned above. ""Issues of biomonitoring and transfer of information were supervised by David Mustra, who is closely associated with another Pentagon contractor, Metabiota,” Konashenkov said. “Previously, he led military bio-projects in Ukraine and Eastern Europe as part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program.” Mustra was the company’s biosafety recruitment manager in Ukraine, its biosurveillance and control managers, and the head of Metabiota’s research and development. With a doctorate in microbiology from UMass Amherst, Guttieri was the Executive Vice President at Metabiota from 2014 until 2019, and was previously the vice president of its Science &amp; Technology Administration. She is now the lead scientist at Labyrinth Global Health. In Ukraine, Guttieri was the integrator of research projects for the US biology program and supervised the execution of biological projects related to the research of animals as vectors of disease. Madhav has been the CEO of Metabiota since 2019. She specializes in epidemiology and pandemics and has a PhD in Public Health. However, according to the Russian MoD, there was no information in the documents about her supervising any specific biological programs in Ukraine. Thorton was Metabiota’s senior microbiologist and laboratory start-up coordinator between 2006 and 2016. He previously spent 20 years in the US Navy, where he worked as a research microbiologist and head of the Navy’s Threat Assessment Department. According to his CV, Thornton did his work at secret facilities, including one in Cairo, Egypt, and “conducted research on disease agents of military relevance, especially enteric pathogens.” In Ukraine, Thornton advised local staff on highly dangerous pathogens as well as other epidemic disease related issues in DTRA projects, and coordinated the upgrade of reference laboratories in Ukraine to biosafety level 3 (BSL-3), which are used to study infectious agents or toxins that may be transmitted through the air and cause potentially lethal infections.

Volodymyr Zelensky's claims that Russia has blocked about 100 foreign ships in Ukrainian ports is a lie, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said, adding that the Kiev authorities have forcibly detained 68 ships from different countries in the ports of four cities. Every day, Russia opens a safe corridor for the exit of these vessels from the territorial waters of Ukraine to the south-west, but their crews told Russian military that the ships are banned from leaving the Ukrainian ports ""under the threat of immediate sinking,"" the Konashenkov added. The Ukrainian Navy placed 420 anchor mines in the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea from 25 February to 4 March, Igor Konashenkov said, denying claims by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Russia was allegedly mining the Black Sea. As a result of a storm in the Black Sea and due to unsatisfactory technical condition, cables with bottom anchors broke at about 10 Ukrainian mines. On 24 February, Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian provocations. In response to Russia’s operation, Western countries have rolled out a comprehensive sanctions campaign against Moscow. "

Since 28 February, the West has doubled down on isolating commodity-rich Russia from global finance. By 4 March, major international shipping groups - including container lines - ""suspended almost all cargo shipments to and from Russia to comply with western sanctions,"" according to Reuters, thus bringing a halt to Russia's deliveries to the global market of critical commodities, including fertilisers and wheat. The US' Russia energy ban and the EU's pledge to cut supplies of hydrocarbons from Russia have put a rocket under oil and gas prices. ""We did talk about food shortages,"" US President Joe Biden said on 24 March at a press conference in Brussels. ""And it’s going to be real. The price of these sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia, it’s imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well."" ""At the end of the day, America and Europe will feel the pain of deprivation from energy, minerals and food,"" says US independent journalist and geopolitical analyst Max Parry. ""Americans have not even begun to feel the true financial effects of the sanctions on Russia and their impact on the US economy which was already ravaged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inflation has been at a rate not seen since the Eighties and supply chain shortages were hurting America's pocketbooks. But now the Biden administration has just poured gasoline onto the fire by placing the most draconian sanctions ever on the Russian Federation which is one of the top world suppliers of fossil fuels as well as base metals that are indispensable to global industrial output."" Now US business owners also have the perfect excuse to blame rising prices on consumer goods, according to Parry. Similarly, the Biden administration is clearly trying to use the Ukraine crisis as an excuse for its poor handling of the American economy, he notes. At the same time, it is difficult to understand the motivations and inner logic of the foreign policy establishment in Washington especially when you consider that sanctions have seldom resulted in the desired outcome at any time in history, according to the analyst. To illustrate his point, Parry cites the fact that western sanctions, slapped on Moscow since 2014, failed to reverse Crimea's reunification with Russia and to prevent Russia ""from continuing to return to the world stage and stand up for its own interests"". Likewise, he says, the US' ""maximum pressure"" on Iran and oil embargo on Venezuela have not resulted in regime change or stopped those nations from integrating with Russia and China's economic infrastructure. It's unclear what the western sanctions are designed to achieve apart from ""making Russia bleed"": the restrictions do not appear to be aimed at halting the conflict as the US and its NATO allies are continuing to send lethal weapons to Ukraine while Moscow is locked in peace negotiations with Kiev. According to US observers, the ongoing weaponry supplies and controversial speculation about putting US boots in Ukraine makes Kiev less willing to negotiate and reach a compromise. Little if any support has been voiced by the West with regard to Moscow's peace effort. The latest progress in the Russo-Ukrainian Istanbul talks was immediately thrown into doubt by the western press, and the Pentagon rushed to express scepticism about Russia's military de-escalation near Kiev. ""Nothing has changed, Russia is just buying time with negotiations,"" claimed CNBC. What stuns Max Parry is that the American Left are not challenging the US mainstream narrative and largely turning a blind eye to the potential negative consequences of anti-Russia sanctions for ordinary Americans. Parry notes that the only Democrats to vote against the US' Russia oil embargo were Cori Bush and Ilhan Omar. Moreover, those Democrats who dare to speak against the established narrative get smeared immediately: ""Just look at the way former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard became persona non grata,"" the journalist notes. New York Representative Jamaal Bowman voted against sending more lethal aid to Ukraine and now is suddenly going to face a primary challenger who is a Kosovar Albanian-American legislator that is extremely pro-NATO, according to Parry. ""Unfortunately, there really is no political opposition to represent the interests of the American people on Capitol Hill when it comes to rapprochement with Russia,"" he says. ""Instead, lawmakers only ensure that the defence industry will continue to make huge profits off tensions between the two countries. Sure, some of them may have voted against additional military aid to Ukraine but when they've even shown any slight deviation from the anti-Russian orthodoxy they open themselves up to attack and risk their political career.""

The MoD has published correspondence between the US President’s son and employees of the US Department of Defense Threat Reduction Office, as well as Pentagon contractors in Ukraine. The emails suggest that Hunter Biden was instrumental in raising funds for the American contractors, Black &amp; Veatch and Metabiota, enabling the companies to engage in pathogen studies on the territory of Ukraine, stated the head of the Russian radiation, chemical and biological defense forces, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov. It also follows from the correspondence that the goals of the Pentagon in Ukraine are far from scientific, underscored the Russian Defense Ministry. Igor Kirillov recalled that earlier, in the course of Russia’s special operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine, the military had seized documents that revealed an ongoing scheme of interaction between US government agencies, the current military-political leadership of the United States with Ukrainian biolabs. In particular, the documentary evidence pointed to the involvement of an investment fund managed by Hunter Biden in financing high-risk biological research in Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry has also presented the names of US officials involved in the creation of bioweapons components in Ukraine. One of these was Robert Pope, at the time Director of the US Defense Department's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at DTRA, which had sought to draw post-Soviet states into biological warfare, stated Major General Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, at Thursday's briefing. Pope spearheaded the idea of ​​​​creating a ""Central Depository of Especially Dangerous Microorganisms in Kiev,"" the general added. Joanna Wintrall, the head of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) office at the US embassy in Kiev, led the coordination of military biological projects in Ukraine, Konashenkov said. Furthermore, Lance Lippencott, Program Director at the Ukrainian division of the company Black &amp; Veatch, acted as the main contact for officials of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense and Health Ministry, said Konashenkov. According to him, Black &amp; Veatch has been working in the interests of the Pentagon since 2008 as an inherent part of projects studying potentially dangerous bioagents. Among these was the UP-1 project to study rickettsia and tick-borne encephalitis virus in arthropods in northwestern Ukraine. In the course of the UP-2 project, the company introduced a system for remote monitoring of the incidence of tularemia and anthrax at Ukrainian biological facilities, said the Russian general, adding: The MoD then revealed that Ukrainian engine maker Motor Sich asked the manufacturers of Turkish Bayraktar drones about the possibility of using the UAVs to spray deadly substances, which raises concerns in the light of the American military biological programme developed in Ukraine. Igor Kirillov stressed that the document on this request is dated 15 December 2021, with Motor Sich wondering if it's possible to equip Bayraktar drones with systems and mechanisms for spraying aerosols with a capacity of more than 20 liters. He emphasised that such a UAV with a flight range of 300 kilometers could pose a real threat of contamination of the territory of Russia. Russia's MoD has previously shed light on the fact that the US spent more than $200 million on the work of biological laboratories in Ukraine, which were a part of the American military biological programme and dealt, in particular, with plague and anthrax pathogens. The freshly-provided damning correspondence comes as the Russian military has spent weeks shedding light on research into deadly pathogens being conducted in Ukrainian laboratories under the direction of the Pentagon and with US funding. Initially, the MoD's reporting was dismissed by Washington as ""Russian disinformation"", with both officials and media since then corroborating many of the assertions. According to Konashenkov, the Russian militarywould be continuing its analysis of documents received from employees of Ukraine-based biological laboratories, including the secret military biological activities being conducted in the country by the US.

Both Russia and Ukraine have been under the “Level 4 – Do Not Travel” US advisory for over a year, on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. In his introductory remarks, Price did not elaborate on “reports” that led the US government to announce the change. The only American known to have been detained by Russian authorities in recent weeks is the WNBA basketball star Brittney Griner. Griner was arrested on February 17 – a week prior to the escalation of hostilities in Ukraine – at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport, for possession of illegal narcotics. A drug-sniffing dog alerted to her luggage and police found carrying cannabis oil cartridges for a vaporizer inhaler, according to the Russian police. Griner has been charged with drug smuggling, and a court ordered her held in jail until May 19."
