The 20-year-old year later explained he had taken the step because of what he described as “unacceptable” behavior from Ukrainian rivals, whom he accused of “greatly escalating” the atmosphere at the competition.  Kuliak later told RT that he displayed the ‘Z’ sign – which has been added to Russian military vehicles and equipment during the operation in Ukraine – because the symbol is “for victory and for peace,” and that he would not hesitate to make the gesture again.The Gymnastics Ethics Foundation (GEF) has opened a disciplinary case against Kuliak, with Russian head coach Valentina Rodionenko fearing at least a one-year ban for the star. Facing that prospect, Kuliak has reiterated that, in his mind, he was not in the wrong.   “In general, I consider the decision to [potentially] suspend me unfair,” said the gymnast, according to Life.ru.“I didn’t do anything illegal, I didn’t break any rules, and now they want to ban me. In all this you can see the attitude towards our country.”Russian head coach Rodionenko likewise said any ban would be unjust, explaining that she and fellow trainer Igor Kalabushkin could also be sanctioned, and accusing the Ukrainian delegation in Doha of inciting antagonism.“The international federation made this decision under pressure from the Ukrainians, and some of them even advocated our lifelong disqualification,” Rodionenko told TASS.“Lawyers are working with us now who hope they’ll save us, but personally I doubt this outcome of the case. The decision should be made at the end of March.”The veteran trainer said Kuliak could be stripped of the bronze medal he won as well as any prize money, with both herself and Kalabushkin potentially being fined.  “Ukrainian athletes in Doha violated all the rules of the competition, they went to the platform wrapped in their national flag, refused to participate in award ceremonies if our girls took part in them,” she added.  “I want to say that I’ve never experienced such humiliation in my entire coaching career. I didn’t experience anything like that even after our boycott of the Olympic Games in the USA in 1984.“In Qatar, they didn’t humiliate us, they humiliated our country… I approached the FIG representative and asked why the Ukrainians behaved like that, to which he replied that he could do nothing about it.”The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) announced on March 6 that it had charged the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation with opening proceedings against Kuliak, accusing him of “shocking behavior.”The FIG previously said it would follow International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommendations and ban all Russian and Belarusian athletes from its events, starting from March 7 and “until further notice.”  "

It’s okay, no problems, don’t worry,” Rylov later said."

""We do not want your participation.""The International Ski Federation (FIS) banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing at its events a day later.The Norwegian representatives had put pressure on the FIS, while the International Olympic Committee encouraged sporting federations to take similar action against athletes from the two nations.All three of the World Cup events immediately following the ban took place in Norway.Now Bolshunov, who became 30km skiathlon world champion in 2021 and took the title in the same event in Beijing alongside the 50km freestyle and 4×10km relay titles, has spoken out.“This is no good – respect should have been present, but in that situation people apparently forgot everything and began to influence us in other ways, although we are athletes and come to compete honestly and cleanly,"" Bolshunov told Russia-24 via RIA.""There was a lot of negativity in Norway... if we ran a race that had a lot of Norwegian fans, it wouldn't be safe to run there. Anything could happen.""With his season prematurely ended, Bolshunov believes the competitive excitement of the sport has also been curtailed by the ban.“When the strongest skiers are excluded, it will be just the Norwegian championship, since the Russian team is a direct competitor,"" he said.""At the Olympic Games, we proved that we are one of the main [teams] in skiing. We deserve [to compete for] the Olympic Games, World Championships, World Cup.""Competition should be a fair fight, a clean fight – and when this does not happen, it is no longer a sport."""

","""The NYT piece on Hunter Biden's laptop comes as Joe Biden's presidency is mired in messes of his own making"", says Wall Street analyst and investigative journalist Charles Ortel. ""Decisions early on to attack fossil fuel production while spending trillions more dollars on fantasy programmes have fuelled historically high inflation rates that threaten a vast majority of Americans who have little savings, mounting debts, and live paycheck to paycheck. Abroad, American errors in foreign policies have been compounded by the arrogant, insolent incompetence of Biden, Harris, and their Cabinet who botched the withdrawal from Afghanistan, opened up our now violent southern border and incite mayhem at many flashpoints, especially in Ukraine now and perhaps soon over Taiwan"". It seems the NYT has finally had enough and now will be amenable to housecleaning well before the looming midterm elections this November, according to the Wall Street analyst. The NYT's latest article about Hunter, titled ""Hunter Biden Paid Tax Bill, But Broad Federal Investigation Continues"", was penned by Katie Benner, Kenneth P. Vogel, and Michael S. Schmidt. On 31 January 2022, Politico revealed that the NYT had sued the State Department under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to obtain emails that were sent or received by officials at the US Embassy in Romania between 2015 and 2019 mentioning Hunter Biden. The lawsuit stems from a 2019 report by the newspaper concerning Hunter's dealings with a Romanian real estate tycoon facing corruption charges, who ""hired"" the then-vice president's son in 2015. According to Politico, the NYT's inquiry into Hunter was spearheaded by investigative journalist Kenneth P. Vogel, who had been at odds with Team Biden throughout 2020. It did not prevent the NYT from attacking the New York Post's inquiry into Hunter's laptop shortly before the 2020 presidential election. At that time, the US legacy media denounced the New York Post story as ""Russian disinformation"". Yet, judging from the January 2022 FOIA, the NYT's 16 March piece is just one of a potential series of reports concerning the president's son. The Wall Street analyst does not rule out that the NYT reporting could be part of an internal political struggle within the Democratic Party. According to him, the NYT harbours ardent supporters of Bernie Sanders and of Hillary Clinton who are seen by some Democrats as more effective than Joe Biden. Furthermore, both Republican and Democratic insiders have been recently speculating about Hillary Clinton possibly running in the 2024 elections, even though she has denied this so far. American observers refer to the revival of the Clinton Global Initiative, which used to be active when the Clintons' participated in politics. The Wall Street analyst believes that Americans who think for themselves are ""thirsty for profound change in a system that encourages criminal behaviour in the political overclass who seem sure they are above all laws"". ""Let us hope the focus finally widens beyond Hunter and Joe Biden to the Clinton and Bush families, among others, that somehow have become much richer in the guise of public 'service' and in false-front philanthropy"", Ortel notes. Meanwhile, Fox News has drawn attention to the NYT's Hunter Biden story being completely ignored by the established media in the country, including CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and NBC. ""It was once routine that damning reports about the president published by The New York Times would lead nearly every news programme"", Fox News wrote on 18 March. ""That is no longer the case, at least under President Biden… Since Wednesday evening, the Times' report has received zero attention on the five major networks"". Let's stay in touch no matter what!

They’re carried out by a sort of “offensive cyber-forces,” which were put together by the US at the suggestion of Kiev, it added.According to Moscow, the “unprecedented scale” of the attacks suggests the operation is being conducted not only by Ukrainian cyber-units that are trained by the Americans and NATO, but also by “anonymous hackers and provocateurs” who answer to the backers of the Kiev government.The statement said the actions of this “army of cyber-mercenaries” who are assigned special missions against Russia “border on open terrorism.”The Russian agencies have so far been able to “effectively resist” those attacks, it added.Such aggression against Moscow is going to lead to “grave consequences for its masterminds and perpetrators.” Those responsible for the cyberattacks will be tracked down and held responsible for their actions in accordance with the law, the Foreign Ministry warned.Russia sent its troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Moscow has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the Donbass by force."

Therefore, everything must be done to expedite the obtaining of the necessary permits,"" Jean-Francois Carenco, the chairman of the Energy Regulatory Commission, told the media. Carenco added that the goal is to have additional LNG receiving capacity brought on line within a year. According to the media, the project for the construction of a floating terminal in the port of Le Havre is being prepared by the French Ministry of Environmental Transformation, energy companies TotalEnergies, GRTGaz, and port structures connecting Le Havre, Rouen and Paris, has not yet been finalized. The floating terminal can import 50 terawatt hours (TWh) of gas per year or 3.9 million tonnes of LNG. It will be able to receive liquefied gas from the United States, Qatar or Africa. Natural gas prices were surging on the European market late last year, spurred by growing energy demand amid an economic recovery after months of lockdowns, as well as a limited supply. This has prompted the EU authorities to reinforce efforts toward ensuring the bloc's energy security, the need for which has become even more pressing during the conflict with Russia, the EU's main energy supplier, over the latter's military operation in Ukraine. Amid crippling global energy shortages, prices spiked further on Wednesday with gas futures topping $1,400 after Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed national energy giant Gazprom to change existing gas contracts into rubles. On 24 February, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Kiev forces. In response to Russia's operation, Western countries have rolled out a comprehensive sanctions campaign against Moscow. "

It has left many communities and people feeling isolated and looking inward. I believe this has exacerbated the polarization and extremist behavior we are seeing across society today.”Western nations responded to the Ukraine crisis by launching an “economic war” against Moscow, including the unprecedented step of barring the Russian central bank from deploying its foreign currency reserves, Fink noted. Capital markets, financial institutions and other businesses have gone beyond the sanctions imposed by their governments, cutting off their Russian ties and operations.“Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and its subsequent decoupling from the global economy is going to prompt companies and governments worldwide to re-evaluate their dependencies and re-analyze their manufacturing and assembly footprints – something that Covid had already spurred many to start doing,” Fink said. As a result, he added, companies will move more operations to their home countries or to neighboring nations, leading to higher costs and prices.The Russia-Ukraine conflict has “upended the world order” that has been in place since the Cold War ended and will require BlackRock to adjust to “long-term structural changes,” such as deglobalization and higher inflation, Fink said. He added that central banks will have to either accept increased inflation – even beyond the 40-year high that was set last month in the US – or reduced economic activity and employment.New York-based BlackRock handles $10 trillion in assets, making it the world’s largest money manager, so Fink’s views are closely watched by investors. In fact, the billionaire wields so much financial clout that his thoughts can be self-fulfilling, to some degree. Among other implications, he said he sees the Ukraine crisis accelerating the development of digital currencies and speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.“The ramifications of this war are not limited to Eastern Europe,” Fink said. “They are layered on top of a pandemic that has already had profound effects on political, economic and social trends. The impact will reverberate for decades to come in ways we can’t yet predict.”Although Fink and Russian leaders don’t see eye-to-eye on the Ukraine conflict – the money manager blames Moscow for causing the crisis – they agree that the world order is changing. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that sanctions against Moscow mark the end of an era, portending an end to the West’s “global dominance” both politically and economically. Ex-President Dmitry Medvedev echoed those comments this week, saying, “The unipolar world has come to an end.”"

While Arla's kefir is produced in Sweden and consists entirely of Swedish raw materials, Arla nevertheless decided to withdraw the product due to “Russian associations”. Kefir is a fermented milk drink similar to thin yogurt made using a specific type of mesophilic symbiotic culture originating in the North Caucasus. Remarkably, sales of smetana, a fellow sour cream product common in Russian cuisine, will continue unperturbed, as Arla deemed its packaging more neutral. The decision by the Danish-Swedish dairy giant sparked a wave of outrage on Twitter. “Swedish Arla has decided to stop producing Kefir, because it's “too much associated with Russia” and “presently unsuitable”. This is one of the most idiotic things I've heard. Have people completely lost their f***ing minds??? It's fermented milk”, one user wrote. Others called it “stupidity at the highest level”. “Today, a package of Kefir became a protest against the madness of groupthink. This is what happens when you answer 'very important' to the question whether companies should take more social responsibility?” another one mused. “God damn what hypocritical nonsense. There was no talk of discontinuing working with American Starbucks when NATO/US destroyed Libya, in violation of international law…” another one chipped in. “A Swedish product by a Swedish company – this is downright ridiculous. And by extension dangerous. Anything that can in any way be associated with anything Russian is pariah. Should my students named Igor, Boris and Anton be forced to change their names as well?” yet another mused. Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, responding to calls for help from the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The US and its Western allies retaliated by imposing massive sanctions against Russia, while many Western companies have also left the country's market in protest. Manufacturers and business owners have started pulling Russian or Russian-associated products as a token of their condemnation. Anti-Russian sentiment has also soared in the West, reaching Cold War-era levels – to the point where schoolchildren are getting bullied and exposed to verbal abuse and people are persecuted for having Russian sympathies.

Bulgaria receives nearly all of its natural-gas supply from Russia.Sofia is currently searching for alternatives to meet its gas demands, holding talks with third parties, Vassilev revealed. “We have held talks with both Greece and Turkey,” he said, adding that the country may potentially receive natural gas from Azerbaijan through the existing pipeline infrastructure.“There are alternatives. The old pipes of the Trans-Balkan route,” he explained. “There we have a capacity of about 20 billion cubic meters and it can be used in both directions, we need some three billion cubic meters.”Purchasing liquefied natural gas from overseas is another option on the table, the official said. Bulgaria and other EU member states are searching for a joint solution to the gas supply issue.“There are supplies from Qatar, Algeria. This is pan-European. A common EU-wide gas contract will be discussed at European level in the next one-to-two weeks. We expect this mechanism to be in place in the summer,” Vassilev said.The EU has renewed its push to reduce its dependency on Russian energy supply amid the ongoing war between Moscow and Kiev that broke out in late February. Moscow launched its offensive following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to regularize the status of the breakaway regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the NATO military bloc.

This is the first visit of a high-ranking Chinese official to India since border clashes in Ladakh in 2020.Wang Yi previously held talks with India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, according to Reuters. Both China and India kept the visit secret until the Beijing diplomat touched down in New Delhi late on Thursday.The talks, set for Friday, are likely to be focused on border tensions between India-China, as well as Russia's military offensive in Ukraine. Both countries have, so far, abstained from condemning and sanctioning Russia for its actions, maintaining trade relations with the country despite pressure from the West.While the two nations have called on Russia to cease hostilities and look for a diplomatic solution, India continues to buy Russian oil and is currently discussing means to switch to a rupee-rouble trade mechanism, allowing the two sides to avoid trading in the euro or the dollar. China has repeatedly denounced unilateral sanctions on Moscow, protesting against Russia’s exclusion from the G20.The relations between China and India began to deteriorate after a clash in the Ladakh region on their Himalayan border in June 2020, where at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed.""Few would have anticipated ... the turn that India’s relations with China have taken in the last two years,"" Indian Foreign Minister said on Thursday, stressing the importance of coordination on defense and foreign policies matters between the two countries. It is likely that India will push for complete disengagement of troops from the region during the Friday talks.The Chinese foreign minister visited Pakistan and Afghanistan earlier this week, and is set to continue his tour across South Asia by traveling to Nepal. In Pakistan, Wang Yi said that “China shares the same hope” as its Islamic colleagues regarding the status of Indian Kashmir province, who advocate for the province’s ""inalienable right to self-determination"". The remark drew anger from some Indian officials ahead of his visit, as the Muslim majority region, controlled by both India and Pakistan, is considered a disputed territory, where India has been fighting armed rebels for decades."
02f26b0e-c67b-4655-8944-2439177f4662,https://www.rt.com/russia/552875-kiev-blasts-red-cross/,Ukraine accuses Red Cross of 'working for enemy',https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.03/xxs/6242bd8920302732015ebe88.jpg,Deputy prime minister accuses international aid organization of helping Russia,"Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has accused the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) of “working for the enemy” after it allegedly assisted in the evacuation of residents from the city of Mariupol to Russia. She implied that the international aid organization was more interested in Russian money than in supporting the Ukrainian cause.The barrage of accusations came from Iryna Vereshchuk, who is Ukraine’s highest-ranking parliamentarian with responsibility for humanitarian affairs. She reiterated Kiev’s claims that Moscow was forcefully abducting Ukrainians from Mariupol, the port city that has seen some of the worst fighting since the month-long Russian attack on Ukraine began. The ICRC had helped with those evacuations, she has alleged.“Ukraine never agreed to a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol to Russia. That’s obvious. They are occupiers. They are enemies. Not peacemakers. The Red Cross had no right to help evacuate people there,” she said in an interview with Ukraine’s Strana news outlet.The ICRC has denied it has ever participated in forced evacuations, either in Ukraine or anywhere else in the world, and stressed that, as a neutral humanitarian organization, its aim was to provide relief, rather than to take one side or the other in a conflict.We never help organize or carry out forced evacuations. This is true in Ukraine. This is true for everywhere we work around the world. We would not support any operation that goes against people’s will.It said it had assisted with westward evacuations from the city of Sumy, but added that its ability to help people in Ukraine was being impacted by the continued failure of the combatants to guarantee the safe passage of humanitarian convoys.Vereshchuk has alleged that, contrary to its mission, the ICRC was “de facto working on the side of the enemy” and that it had been financially motivated to do so. “Money doesn’t stink,” she remarked, using the words the Roman emperor Vespasian said to his son to explain why taxing even urine was a good policy.“That is not my suspicion – I know it for sure. Nobody hid the fact that the Red Cross received donations from Russia,” Vereshchuk added.The ICRC receives funding through voluntary donations, with over 80% of them coming from donor states that are party to the Geneva Conventions. The organization says it “only accepts funds from those who respect the ICRC’s independence and impartiality of action.” Critics argue it is a key foreign policy institution of its host country, Switzerland, which can hardly be considered as taking Russia’s side in the Ukraine crisis.Vereshchuk has declared that the ICRC has “discredited itself” in the eyes of Kiev to the point of requiring institutional change. The agency had proved to be “toothless” and “impotent” in Ukraine, she said. She made it clear that her criticism did not extend to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, however, which, she admitted, had “started receiving hate” amid Kiev’s attacks on the ICRC.The Ukrainian government had earlier demanded that the ICRC not open an office in Rostov-on-Don, the largest Russian city on Ukraine’s eastern border, in response to an influx of refugees. Kiev claimed such a move would “legitimize” Russian “abductions” of Ukrainians – that is, evacuations to which Kiev had not given its permission.Moscow has denied having forced Ukrainians to flee from hostilities to its territory, and has accused Kiev of trying to use its own civilians as a human shield.The ICRC has reiterated that its priority is “to reach victims of armed conflict, wherever they are, in order to assist them.”"

The Government Information Cell (GIC) is operated between the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office, the first such unit since the end of the Cold War. The social media platform mentioned in the article has refuted reports that it showed British government ads.  The unit’s “crucial audiences” are in Russia and Ukraine, the article highlights. After Moscow blocked Twitter and Facebook, the Telegraph reports, the GIC has turned to advertising agencies to “target” Russian users on sites such as VK, the country’s most popular domestic social media platform. The tech firm's press service has already refuted the claim, telling Russian news site RBC that “all ads go through verification and have to follow VK’s and Russia’s law.” The website rules in any case prohibit political ads.The tactic is described as reaching the devices of people “who would never have thought to seek out the view of the British Government.” Some 35 full-time staff were reportedly pulled from numerous departments, including the Foreign Office, Home Office, Ministry of Defence, Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, and the Cabinet Office. Britain’s Foreign Secretary Liz Truss revealed the unit’s creation in late February, days before Moscow attacked its neighbor. Back then she outlined in an interview with the Mail that the unit’s task is to expose and fight “false information.” Details of how the unit is countering supposed “Kremlin disinformation” were given in the Telegraph’s report.The unit identifies so-called “Russian disinformation,” brands it as false and then creates “new content” to be spread online. It also apparently distributes reports to NATO and EU members, along with Australia and New Zealand. The unit further coordinates with embassies abroad to translate content around the world. The article gave an example of the sort of content the unit disseminates. One of the videos from late February involves Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressing Russians in their own language saying that “I do not believe this war is in your name.” The unit claims that more than eight million people viewed this video, according to the Telegraph. VK’s audience is nearly 79.3 million as of October 2021.An unnamed person dubbed an “ally of Ms Truss”  told the newspaper that the Foreign Secretary believed that “ditching our Cold War anti-propaganda capability was a mistake,” and that this unit is a restoration of that.In 1948 during the Cold War-era Foreign Office had a covert unit called the Information Research Department (IRD) created to spread anti-Soviet and anti-communist views. It was disbanded in 1977 by then-Foreign Secretary David Owen. The IRD is thought to have operated alongside MI6 and the BBC’s World Service. Among other controversial dimensions, according to declassified documents, the British propaganda campaign incited the mass slaughter of communists in Indonesia in the 1960s. The unit was also involved in undermining the Irish Republican Army during the war in Northern Ireland and in countering the ‘Black Power’ movement in the Caribbean."

Once one of the British Army’s most senior officers, Shaw was speaking on talk radio station LBC on Saturday.“We are obsessed with humanitarian concerns and individual suffering, and that makes good TV, but the reality is this is far more serious than that,” the Major-General, whose 30-year career spanned the Falklands and Kosovo to commanding the UK forces in Iraq in 2006, warned.The West has imposed draconian sanctions on Russia after it attacked Ukraine a month ago. This includes the US and Canada giving up their need for supplies of Russian hydrocarbon fuels, and the EU and UK announcing plans to join them in the near future.The restrictions and retaliatory steps by Moscow have already seen energy and food prices spiking in many Western nations. There were reports of British food-bank users refusing free potatoes because they couldn’t afford to boil them. But Shaw predicted that this is only the beginning.“We’ve now decided that as far as Russia’s concerned we’re going to play geopolitics ahead of economics and we’ve to pay a price for that,” he explained.And, according to the Major-General, governments in the UK and elsewhere aren’t doing enough to ready their citizenry “for that sort of hardship and that attitude.” “We need to be psychologically preparing our people for a long-term degradation of standard of living and a long-term confrontation with Russia,” he argued.“Our quality of life back home absolutely depends on them – cheap fuel, cheap access, doing deals with Saudi Arabia, and things like that,” Shaw pointed out.Russia sent troops to Ukraine in late February following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the breakaway Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Another goal of the military operation is to “denazify” the country, according to Moscow. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."
04b336c1-85a7-4cec-91d0-868c8e439355,https://on.rt.com/bugd,"In Washington, Covid relief takes back seat to aid and guns for Ukraine",https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.03/xxs/623dab3d85f54044c26bea88.jpg,Congress was quick to agree on aid for Ukraine – which includes weapons for other US allies – but not on ending the pandemic,"The US federal government has run out of money to cover the cost of Covid-19 testing and treatment for uninsured people. Along with this, vaccine administration for the uninsured will also end in a few weeks. Since the Covid-19 pandemic is far from over and has been particularly bad in the United States already, the results of this will be disastrous. On March 15, the White House released a fact sheet warning about the implications of this funding deficit. Among the key issues were the fact that it would be harder to identify emerging variants, scaling back of planned purchases of preventative treatments, and damage to global vaccination and treatment efforts. As one of the few developed countries in the world that does not have universal health care, this essentially means that coverage for Covid-19, during an ongoing pandemic that has killed nearly 1 million Americans already, will be rationed based on wealth. Starting March 28, hospitals and doctors’ offices won’t be reimbursed by the federal government for testing or treating uninsured patients for Covid-19. This means patients will be turned away if they don’t have the money in most cases unless providers decide to treat them for free or at a discount. In early April, the same will apply to those seeking vaccination. Some states will retain an emergency Medicaid option that would allow free Covid-19 testing and treatment for the uninsured. However, the problem is that less than half of US states opted into the program – and most of the states not signed on happen to also mostly be poorer ones. Prior to this funding disaster, the federal government had essentially been declaring victory on the pandemic. The CDC lifted its mask and other guidelines and also changed its definition of what high transmission means, which now reflects the degree to which Covid-19 outbreaks are straining hospital systems – not actual community transmission. Likewise, the administration had been saying that the situation on the ground was changing because Covid-19 was no longer as deadly given the myriad treatment options and available vaccinations. Lack of access to these treatments immediately changes this calculus, making low household income another ‘at risk’ factor for the coronavirus. This is, of course, an outcome Americans are famously used to. According to one highly cited study by the National Library of Medicine from 2008 during that era’s health care policy debate, about 26,000 Americans die every year from lack of health insurance. Another one in 2009 by the American Journal of Public Health found that this figure was about 45,000. Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA, often called ObamaCare) may have reduced these preventable deaths, but federal aid being pulled during the worst public health emergency in a century will see this number increase. There is zero doubt. So why isn’t anyone doing anything about this? As tends to be the case, the answer is Congress. On March 2, the White House asked Congress for another $22.5 billion in funding for testing, vaccines, and treatments – but it has failed to pass anything on this issue even though there have been a few attempts. It seems Congress is happy to just pretend the pandemic is over and get on with life. What’s also ironic about the White House’s funding request is that it also included a funding request for aid to Ukraine. The deadlocked Senate, which is split 50-50 for both parties and can’t even agree to reduce childhood poverty, the next week passed a $1.5 trillion government funding package that included  $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine – but nixed a reduced $15 billion in Covid-19 relief for Americans. Note that this aid to Ukraine is split into ‘humanitarian’ and ‘lethal’. In addition to some $3 billion of this being spent on direct funding to the US military’s European Command, it will see an additional $3 billion allocated toward providing weapons to Ukraine and other US allies in Europe. Arms lobbyists and their underlings in Congress and the Pentagon are scrambling now to unlock more funds for the military-industrial complex to pump out weapons to Europe, as Politico reported on March 22, including guaranteed contracts and a potential invocation of the Defense Production Act. Likewise, the Pentagon is expected to roll out its budget proposal in the coming days which will list a few priorities, including hypersonic missiles, to reach parity with Russia after Russia’s self-reported usage of its Kinzhal hypersonic missile system in Ukraine. The cost to research, develop, test, and then fast-track this weapon system would be immense but is already being teed up in Congress. This funding dilemma says a lot about Washington. Nearly 1,000 Americans are still dying from Covid-19 every day and the country’s combined death toll is nearing 1 million – but Congress doesn’t want to fund treatment and testing anymore. But when it comes to funneling weapons to Ukraine and developing weapon delivery systems for its great power rivalry with Russia, well, Congress has it covered and then some. "

Tokyo has said that it will coordinate its response with its G7 allies. India, on the other hand, has maintained neutrality in the conflict, even stepping up its crude purchases from Moscow.","Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has asked his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to ""cooperate further"" on the security crisis in Ukraine, as the two leaders met for an annual summit in New Delhi on Saturday. Hikarika Ono, the press secretary at Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters after the Modi-Kishida meeting that they both had ""agreed on four important points"" as far as the situation in Ukraine is concerned. ""Any attempt to change the status quo by force cannot be accepted anywhere in the world"", the Japanese official listed out what she claimed was the first point of agreement. ""We should seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict"", she added. Ono also said that both leaders agreed to ""jointly tackle the situation"", backed the immediate ""cessation of violence"", and wanted to break the ""deadlock"" in the ongoing peace talks. Ono further said that both nations would ""jointly support"" Ukraine and its neighbouring nations in tackling the ""humanitarian crisis"" caused by the fighting in Ukraine. ""They emphasised that the contemporary global order has been built on the UN Charter, international law, and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of states"", the joint statement added. The joint announcement comes against the backdrop of firing incidents at the Zaporozhye nuclear facility in Ukraine, with the Russian Defence Ministry this month accusing Ukrainian fighters of creating a provocation at the installation. The Russian Defence Ministry has also accused Ukrainian ""neo-Nazi battalions"" of planning to blow up a nuclear reactor near Kharkov and blame Moscow for it. ""The fact that humanitarian assistance is an element that both our countries believe in, and we are all also engaged in that"", Shringla told reporters. During their joint appearance at Delhi's Hyderabad House after the meeting, Modi didn't make any direct reference to Ukraine in his press statement. Kishida, on the other hand, mentioned the security crisis there. A significant outcome of the meeting was Japan's pledge to enhance its investments in India over the next five years. During his press briefing, Shringla said that the investment was a ""sign of the level of cooperation in the economic domain that the two countries enjoy"". Let's stay in touch no matter what!

He explained that Bulgaria, the country through which gas supplies to Serbia and Hungary is delivered, has declared its unwillingness to switch to rubles in gas payments.In response, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the issue is closed, and Bulgaria will have to pay in rubles “whether they like it or not.”However, he addressed Serbia’s concerns, noting that the country has abstained from any hostile acts or comments against Russia in connection with Ukraine.“This does not apply to Serbia. The problem remains to be solved and, naturally, Serbia’s concerns will be our top priority,” Peskov said.“It’s absolutely normal, [Vucic] is right, this can really be a problematic situation, because in this case, Bulgaria took hostile steps against us, so they will have to pay in rubles, whether they want to or not, whether they like it or not,” Peskov stated.Earlier this week, the former deputy energy minister of Bulgaria, Yavor Kuyumdzhiyev, said the country greatly depends on Russian gas and lacks alternatives.In the first major response to Western sanctions, President Vladimir Putin announced on Wednesday that Russia will now accept payment for gas exports to “unfriendly countries” in rubles only.The timeframe for switching to rubles in gas payments has not been announced yet. However, according to Peskov, the conditions for the move will be clarified directly to Russian gas buyers in due course.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

He reminded that in the course of its special military operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine, the Russian Armed Forces do not strike at civilian targets. Zelensky’s earlier statement accusing  Russia's forces of targeting Uman - a site visited by pilgrims from Israel - is a ""cynical lie,"" Konashenkov said. The synagogue in Uman, according to the Russian MoD, is being used by the Kiev nationalist regime for military purposes, so that any attack on it could be used to provoke a conflict, making Russia the target of political pressure from Jewish religious organizations, added the general. On 20 March, Ukraine's  President Volodymyr Zelensky, addressing the Israeli Knesset via Zoom, accused Russia of allegedly launching missile strikes at the city of Uman, Cherkasy region.  For further dramatic effect, Zelensky had stated that Russian forces were purportedly targeting a place “where tens of thousands of Israelis come each year to visit the grave of Rabbi Nachman.” The Ukrainian leader also said that Israel ""will have to live"" with its decisions to withhold military aid from Kiev. Israel has refrained from joining Western sanctions against Russia and not agreed to provide Kiev with military equipment. According to evidence presented by the Russian Defense Ministry on Wednesday, weapons and ammunition stored in the synagogue building in Uman had been loaded by the nationalists into dump trucks and then disguised as bags of construction debris.  Furthermore, photographic evidence showed that nationalist units and foreign mercenaries from the western regions of Ukraine were being transported on vehicles disguised as school buses, with the sign ""Children"" painted on them, said the MoD. Major General Igor Konashenkov noted that the Russian Defense Ministry has repeatedly exposed the cynical lies that the Kiev nationalist regime peddles in its desperate struggle to maintain its power in Ukraine and mislead the world community.

Following the US president's declaration that Putin ""cannot remain in power,"" the Kremlin responded that it is obviously not up to Biden to decide.","""Clearly, the remarks are not one of diplomacy nor of respect for other nations, moreover they have the potential of further escalating an already highly dangerous situation and continue to test the boundaries of US-Russia relations,"" says Earl Rasmussen, executive vice president of Eurasia Group. ""Yet, there are those in positions of influence that seek exactly what President Biden stated clearly. Why make such a statement in public?"" Joe Biden made a stunning statement on Saturday night at the end of what mainstream media called a ""well-crafted"" speech. ""For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" Biden said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. After the apparent gaffe, the White House jumped in to assure the press that the president was not calling for a regime change in Russia, while the US mainstream media pointed out that Biden had gone off the script. Biden very much wants to appear to be tough on Russia, according to Pamela Geller, an American political activist, blogger, and editor-in-chief of the Geller Report. She notes that the US president ""also is trying to counter the overall impression of weakness and impotence that his administration has conveyed."" ""But it's all hollow, as the White House retractions and clarifications demonstrate,"" Geller remarks. British and French officials have distanced themselves from Biden's controversial statements, with French President Emmanuel Macron warning the US against the use of inflammatory language in an already tense situation. This wasn't the only aggressively hostile remark concerning Vladimir Putin and Russia muttered by the American commander-in-chief: earlier he called his Russian counterpart a ""war criminal"" and a ""butcher."" The Kremlin made it clear that the US president's claims are ""absolutely inadmissible and inexcusable."" However, Rasmussen does not rule out that it was not just a ""gaffe"": ""There may be a desire to test the reaction within Europe; to send a signal or threat to Russia; to influence the Russian public,"" he suggests. ""When I heard such outlandish remarks it brought back memories of the “Assad must Go” campaign in Syria. Yes, the US foreign policy team was much the same."" The Biden administration is not pushing forward with any diplomatic solution and is not trying to de-escalate the situation, the observers point out. Instead, Washington is not only resorting to aggressive rhetoric but is also flooding Ukraine with weapons, according to them. While delivering his speech in Warsaw last Saturday the US president vowed to send more lethal arms to Ukraine, stressing that ""this battle will not be won in days, or months either."" Moscow appears to be fully aware of the plans and desires of Joe Biden and his team, according to Rasmussen. Before launching the special operation to de-militarise and de-Nazify Ukraine under Article 51 of the UN Charter, the Russian leadership asked the West in mid-December 2021 to provide legal guarantees of NATO's non-expansion eastward and Ukraine's non-admission to NATO, among other issues. However, the US, NATO and the EU rejected Moscow's key proposals. Right now the US foreign policy team is ""panicking and extremely frustrated,"" Rasmussen says. According to the scholar, extensive censorship in Europe and in the US is caused by the fact that Western governments do not control the situation. He believes that their policies, including the bans on Russian energy, have been hasty and ill-thought-out amid galloping post-COVID inflation and soaring prices. The EU has become the biggest loser as a consequence of this policy, according to the observers. Having backed themselves into a corner, Western governments ""may do something even worse such as a 'false flag' or intervention,"" he warns. ""Such actions would rapidly see an escalation of the conflict and easily could pull Europe in completely,"" remarks the scholar. Biden is clearly trying to use Russia as a bogeyman to divert the American public's attention from snowballing domestic problems, according to Rasmussen. ""Yet, while President Putin’s approval ratings are rising, President Biden’s seems to be continuing to fall,"" the scholar remarks. Biden's approval rating has plummeted to 40%, as the latest Reuters poll has found. At the same time, according to the latest NBC News survey, 7 in 10 Americans expressed low confidence in President Joe Biden’s ability to deal with Russia's special operation in Ukraine. Moreover, many US residents are starting to feel the pain of the sanctions against Russia, says Rick Sterling. What's more, this situation will only get worse since ""Russia is a vital component not just for markets but in the global supply chain impacting almost every element that touches our lives,"" according to Rasmussen. ""The Washington elite in their [effort] to protect borders halfway around the world and a democracy that they themselves destroyed in a coup in 2014 seem to have missed assessing the impact of their insane actions,"" he says. ""Let’s hope they do not continue us down such a dangerous path. Unfortunately, my eternal optimism is fading."" "

Russian driver Nikita Mazepin – who has since been abruptly released by American team Haas because of the conflict – had accepted the decision.“If some individual sports or entities choose to do an outright ban of Russian or Belarussian athletes, then we will support that as well,"" said Huddleston.“But if they chose to go down the neutral route, then we are requesting they get that assurance [about allegiances].”Member of Parliament for Mid Worcestershire Huddleston has been involved in overseeing the sanctions imposed on Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, whose assets were frozen by the UK government because of his alleged ties to Putin.""I continue to work with the [Chelsea] fans but I was very clear from day one and it's still the case – this is not business as usual,"" said Huddleston.""This is a different world because the club's owner has been sanctioned... the whole strategy throughout is to be very, very clear that Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned and that has clearly had implications.""I was very honest and open with the Chelsea fans [by] saying, 'this will have an impact because he has been sanctioned and he is the owner of the club.'""Abramovich announced his intention to sell the club on March 2 after almost 19 years in charge but was barred from making the sale as part of sanctions aimed at ensuring he cannot profit from Chelsea.The Champions League holders are operating under a government licence with restrictions including a block on the club selling merchandise and tickets for home games at Stamford Bridge.Certain restrictions have now been lifted and fans are now able to buy tickets for away and cup games, with the proceeds going to the Premier League for further distribution.""We have tried to make reasonable modifications to the licence to enable fans to engage with the club and continue as much as reasonably possible,"" said Huddleston.The Chelsea Supporters' Trust (CST) wants supporters to be able to buy tickets for home games.In a statement on Tuesday, the group said: ""The CST is deeply disappointed that we are yet to receive a response from Nigel Huddleston, [Culture Minister] Nadine Dorries or the Department of Culture, Media and Sport on important issues – including clarity on ticketing."""

Last year, the transit amounted to 41.66 billion cubic meters. According to earlier reports, Gazprom pays Ukraine roughly $2 billion per year for its transit services.According to Vitrenko, Russian companies that are not subject to restrictions can use their accounts in the West despite the sanctions, can receive money from oil and gas sales, and pay Ukraine for transit. The Naftogaz CEO called on Europe and its allies to put Moscow’s revenues for energy flows in an escrow account until the Russian troops withdraw.The EU has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia to try to cut off the cash flow to the government and force it to abandon its military operation in Ukraine. The bloc also pledged to reduce its dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year and to wean itself off completely before 2030.Since the start of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, gas flows to Europe soared to the highest level since December, according to Bloomberg. Ukraine’s gas transit network operator reported a 20% daily increase in capacity bookings during the period, and Gazprom confirmed that supplies increased due to more orders from European customers. In the first two weeks of March, Gazprom’s deliveries to Europe were at the highest level since last August.The increase in imports from Russia – which is the second largest producer of natural gas globally – reflects the lack of options Europe has in the short-term to meet natural gas demand, JPMorgan Chase said in a report last week.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

However, the institution raised eyebrows online by comparing the devastation suffered by its cities to that endured by Nazi Germany during Allied bombing raids, in World War Two.The bizarre choice of comparison is the latest Nazi-related statement to come out of Kiev.The image posted to Twitter by the account of the ‘Verkhovna Rada’ (Parliament) portrays a bombed out building in Hamburg in 1943 alongside similar damage to the Ukrainian city of Kharkov in 2022.The text above the image reads “When the Sky is Open,” and a message in English demands that the West “#CloseTheSky over Ukraine.”“Close The Sky” is a reference to the possibility of a NATO-imposed ‘no-fly zone’ over Ukraine, a step Kiev has demanded but leaders in Washington and Brussels have thus far refused to take. It would involve NATO committing to shooting down Russian aircraft over Ukraine, a step that would bring the bloc into open combat with Russia and, in the words of US President Joe Biden, lead to “a third world war.”Bizarrely, the image shared by the parliament asks the same allies that bombed Hamburg in 1943 to fight on Ukraine’s behalf today. The Rada did not explain why it chose to compare Kharkov with Hamburg, especially considering the fact that Kharkov itself was bombed by Germany during the Second World War, which would have made for a comparison that wouldn’t involve comparing Ukraine with Nazi Germany.The analogy drew some puzzled comments online. “You aren't supposed to compare yourselves to Nazis in public,” one commenter joked. “Man, they really don’t know what optics are,” another quipped.Russian President Vladimir Putin has long accused Ukrainian elites of harboring sympathies for Nazi Germany, and in a speech announcing the start of Russia’s military offensive on Ukraine last month, he said that one of Russia’s goals was to “denazify” the country.Aside from integrating the neo-Nazi ‘Azov’ batallion into its military, Kiev authorities have launched efforts to portray its people as racially distinct from Russians, whom local politicians have openly referred to as “orcs.”Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera is considered a hero to Ukrainian nationalists, and just last week a television host in Ukraine, Fahruddin Sharafmal, caused controversy when he approvingly quoted Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in calling for the murder of Russians and their children."

A bit more – and Budapest's official rhetoric will be totally pro-Russian. What is this? Want some cheap Russian gas? Or maybe want our Transcarpathia?” Vereshchuk wrote before calling on Budapest to “join the civilized world” and “not to repeat the mistakes of World War II when Hungary made a wrong choice.”Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country would not support anti-Russia sanctions which would cause harm to its own interests, including the penalties targeting Russian gas and oil. He also reiterated that Hungary was against any proposals involving sending NATO soldiers to Ukraine or creating a no-fly zone over the country, explaining that such actions would raise the risk of a larger-scale war.Though the Hungarian government has condemned Moscow’s attack on Ukraine and supported some sanctions, it has consistently defended its wish to “stay out” of the conflict and has refused to join other countries in sending weapons to Ukraine.Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two Donbass republics by force."

The supposedly independent British media regulator has proven itself to be a tool of the government, RT deputy editor-in-chief Anna Belkina has claimed.With its decision Ofcom “has shown the UK public, and the regulatory community internationally, that despite a well-constructed facade of independence, it is nothing more than a tool of government, bending to its media-suppressing will,” Belkina said.“By ignoring RT's completely clean record of four consecutive years and stating purely political reasons tied directly to the situation in Ukraine and yet completely unassociated to RT’s operations, structure, management or editorial output, Ofcom has falsely judged RT to not be 'fit and proper' and in doing so robbed the UK public of access to information,” she added.The British media regulator launched an investigation into RT UK amid a pan-European effort to stem out Russian media from the continent in the wake of Moscow’s attack against Ukraine. The broadcaster’s other branches, like RT International, as well as its French- and German-language sister channels, have been banned from broadcasting by the EU. Multiple British officials had publicly called for the silencing of the channel, branding it as Russian propaganda.In its notice of license suspension sent to RT, Ofcom specifically mentions the “Russian Federation’s current conduct in Ukraine” as one of the reasons for gagging the channel. It is “difficult to see how a Russian state-funded news broadcaster could credibly avoid covering the events in Ukraine, or could expect to remain funded if it failed to convey the narrative that the Russian Federation seeks to impose on its own people and the rest of the world,” the regulator said.The regulator acknowledged that it had cleared RT of wrongdoing in some of its previous investigations of alleged breaches and that since those cases, the last of which happened in 2018, “we have not had reason to investigate any of its programming, and have not found it in breach of the Code.” Nevertheless, the watchdog decided that RT’s compliance history “demonstrates that it has particular difficulty in complying with the due impartiality rules of the Code where they relate to matters of Russian foreign policy.”Ofcom said it was particularly concerned about a new Russian law, which introduced prison terms for reporting deliberate misinformation about the Russian Armed Forces, which it believes “effectively criminalized independent journalism.”The regulator has not concluded any of its 29 current investigations into RT launched since late February, stating instead that “the volume and potentially serious nature of the concerns raised within such a short period is deeply concerning.”It concluded that “it appears impossible for the licensee to comply with the Code in respect of a matter of major political importance.” The decision to ban RT was proportionate and necessary “to protect audiences” and maintain public trust in the UK’s licensing system, Ofcom said.In February, the British government asked Ofcom to reconsider the broadcasting license of RT, accusing the company of being part of a “global disinformation campaign.” Previously, former British ambassador to Syria and Bahrain Peter Ford alleged in an interview to RT that Ofcom is not the the “real decider” of RT’s fate. According to the former diplomat, the government is only “pretending to pass the buck to Ofcom.”"

According to the head of the company, they have no other contractual basis.President Putin announced earlier in the day that Russia will now accept payment for gas exports to “unfriendly countries” in rubles only.The measure is the first serious response from Moscow to sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and its allies over the conflict in Ukraine. A number of mostly Western countries have taken steps to isolate Russia from their financial systems. Major Russian banks have been cut off from the SWIFT payment network, making it difficult for the country to continue transactions in euros and US dollars.  For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

He also urged the Jewish state to take action, impose sanctions on Russia, and provide his country with advanced equipment and technology.","On Sunday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a speech to Israeli MPs after addressing lawmakers in the US, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Initially, the plan was that Zelensky would address Israeli politicians from the stage of the Knesset in Jerusalem. But the idea was eventually scrapped with the excuse that the plenum was on a scheduled break. Instead, he was offered to speak to lawmakers via Zoom, while the parliamentarians were given the option to not attend his address. Some seized on the opportunity and skipped the event. But the majority listened in, along with more than a thousand ordinary Israelis who gathered on Tel Aviv's Habima Square to watch the address live. In his speech, the Ukrainian president was trying to speak to the hearts of the masses. He compared the actions of the Russians currently carrying out a special military operation in Ukraine to those of the Nazis. Zelensky claimed that Moscow was carrying out a ""final solution"" against the Ukrainians and urged Israel to help his people, just as the Ukrainians ""came to the rescue"" of the Jews some 80 years ago. By ""helping out"", Zelensky referred to a number of measures. He demanded that Israel provide Ukraine with its Iron Dome missile defence system. He called for severe sanctions to be introduced on Russia and urged for more Ukrainian refugees to be taken in. Zelensky’s criticism was probably meant to evoke guilt among Israelis, but once the speech was over, it turned out that his remarks had quite an opposite effect. Israeli experts, politicians, and journalists have taken to social media platforms to vent their dissatisfaction with the speech, which slammed Israel on all possible fronts. Some said his Holocaust analogy was ""outrageous"". Others treated his criticism as sheer ""ungratefulness"", especially given the efforts Israel has been making to help the Ukrainian people. Since the Russian military operation kicked off on 24 February, Israel has absorbed more than 5,000 Ukrainian refugees, with many others still on their way. The country has also exerted efforts to mediate between Moscow and Kiev. It has poured in millions of dollars into setting up a makeshift hospital in the west of Ukraine, while Israeli NGOs have collected money, food, clothes, and medicine to assist the country. Ordinary Israelis did not appreciate Zelensky's criticism either, and too took to social media platforms to express their anger with the Ukrainian leader. However, comments about the Holocaust were far from the only issue that stirred anti-Zelensky sentiments, with many twitterians slamming the Ukrainian head of state for demanding that Israel neglect its national interests and take sides. Over the years, Israel and Russia have established stable trade relations and tight cooperation on a number of issues. Moscow, which protects the air space in Syria, clinched a deal with Tel Aviv on military coordination in Syria to prevent accidents following the 2018 downing of a Russian Il-20 plane off the Syrian coast during Israeli airstrikes on Latakia. Russia also helps mediate between Israel and the Palestinians, especially in the Gaza Strip Israel would not want to risk jeopardising those ties. It is also not ready to provide the Ukrainians with the equipment they are seeking to obtain. The harsh criticism of Zelensky appears to have done the trick. During the night, the Ukrainian president released a message where he thanked Israel for all its efforts. But as Russia's military operation continues, and Israel stays firm on maintaining its relative neutrality, another serving of harsh remarks might be just a matter of time. "

The official pointed the finger at Poroshenko’s decision to write NATO aspirations into the country’s constitution.The clause, outlining Kiev’s pathway to becoming a full-fledged member of the EU and US-led NATO alliance, was added into Ukraine's constitution in February 2019 and shortly before presidential elections. While the move was a pure PR stunt for the former president, it turned out to have long-lasting consequences, Arestovich told local media.“When Poroshenko introduced this, it was his personal pre-election PR technology. He knew beforehand that NATO would never accept us. Not the least share of the blame for what is happening now in Ukraine lies with those who adopted and promoted this constitutional provision,” he said, implying that those Ukrainian MPs who supported the clause share the blame for it as well. The constitutional change received overwhelming support back then with 334 out of 450 MPs voting for it.Under Poroshenko, the desire to join NATO was also incorporated into the country’s military doctrine in 2015. That document also formally established Russia as a “military adversary” of Kiev.Ukraine’s NATO aspirations, however, actually date well before the February 2019 constitutional reform. The country was cozying up to the US-led bloc since the late 1990s, sending a “peacekeeping unit” to Iraq in 2002, adopting legislation allowing military access of NATO forces onto its soil in 2004, and so on.The bloc itself formally recognized Ukraine’s aspirations in 2008, when the alliance announced in the Bucharest Summit Declaration that it welcomed “Ukraine’s and Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO.” The summit participants agreed that eventually these countries would “become members of NATO.”Moscow attacked the neighboring state following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to regularize the status of the breakaway regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO military bloc. Kiev says the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two rebellious republics by force."

So far, Beijing has only expressed support for ongoing talks between diplomats from Kiev and Moscow.","The Biden administration unveiled new sanctions against Chinese officials on Monday, restricting the visas of those the White House claims are ""involved in repressive acts against members of ethnic and religious minority groups and religious and spiritual practitioners"" in China's western Xinjiang Autonomous Region ""and outside of China's borders, including within the United States."" The minister did not elaborate on the precise nature of the allegations regarding the targeting of Uyghurs in the United States. However, since the Taliban* took over from the US-backed Afghan government in August 2021, Beijing has pressured Kabul to end its support for the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a terrorist group responsible for numerous attacks in China. Until 2020, the US also considered the ETIM a terrorist group, noting its ties to the Taliban and al-Qaeda**, but removed it from the list after claiming it no longer existed. Other Uyghur separatist groups, including the World Uyghur Congress and Uyghur Human Rights Project, have enjoyed extensive largesse from US groups like the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a group created in the 1980s to serve as a front for the CIA so as to disguise the flow of funds to groups useful to US foreign policy, as past heads of the NED have admitted. Beijing denies that a genocide is taking place in Xinjiang. The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) also denies accusations that it forcibly sterilizes Uyghur women or restricts Uyghur culture and the practice of Islam, suggesting instead  that its rehabilitation and training programs for former extremists are voluntary and in line with guidelines contained within the United Nations Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. The CCP additionally asserts that the Uyghur population has been voluntarily enrolled in vocational training centers a part of a deradicalization program aimed at eliminating support for groups like the ETIM. The new sanctions come as the Biden administration is trying to woo Beijing into breaking its alignment with Moscow, after the Kremlin initiated its special military operation Ukraine last month. US President Joe Biden told Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call on Friday that China would face sanctions if it sent military aid to Russia during the Ukraine special military operation. *The Taliban - a group under United Nations sanction for terrorist activities **Al-Qaeda - a terrorist group banned in Russia and many other countries "

Will the US media and justice machine step in to investigate the matter?","""US presidents seem to get away with a lot, as long as the so-called Military-Industrial-Counter-Intelligence-Media-Academia-Think Tank complex (MICIMATT) is behind them"", says Retired US Air Force Lt. Col. Karen Kwiatkowski, a former analyst for the US Department of Defence. ""The FBI Hunter Biden laptop cover-up lasted for over two years. If the Ukrainian biolabs are destroyed or cleaned up without incident, I expect this story will be memory-holed for longer than that"". The fact that the US was developing components of biological weapons in Ukraine has been largely ignored by international watchdogs, while Washington vehemently denied any involvement whatsoever in the programme, branding it a ""Russian conspiracy theory"". However, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland on 8 March told US senators that ""bioresearch facilities"" in Ukraine actually exist, while a 2010 BioPrepWatch article preserved in web archives and the US Armed Forces' Counterproliferation Centre confirmed that America had maintained bioresearch cooperation with Kiev since 2005. The Russian Ministry of Defence has held a number of presentations revealing the depth of the US bioweapons programme in Ukraine run by the Pentagon's Defence Threat Reduction Agency. At least 31 laboratories across 14 settlements are suspected of being involved in US-funded military biological activities. The Rosemont Seneca investment fund, co-founded by Hunter Biden, participated in the funding of Ukrainian biolabs in cooperation with Metabiota, a subcontractor to the Pentagon's principal contactor Black &amp; Veatch, according to the Russian MoD. Metabiota and Black &amp; Veatch are known as major supplies of equipment for Pentagon biolaboratories around the world, the MoD specifies. According to Kwiatkowski, major mainstream sources are likely to suppress the story as major US defence contractors are heavily investing in American mainstream media. The former Pentagon analyst notes that judging from surveys, 90% of US mainstream media personalities, reporters, and publishers are politically Democrats, which makes it almost impossible that they would attack the Democratic administration and key politicians. ""I think it will be suppressed and access to many overseas new organisations is already being blocked by Google, Facebook, and Twitter"", she says. Yet, the Daily Mail – a media outlet belonging to Australian-born US media mogul Rupert Murdoch – reported on 25 March that the Russian MoD's findings are ""at least partially true"". According to the media outlet, the emails from Hunter's laptop ""show he helped secure millions of dollars of funding"" for Metabiota, a Department of Defence contractor which worked in Ukraine, specialising in research on pandemic-causing diseases ""that could be used as bioweapons"". Per the media outlet, Hunter Biden and his business partners invested $500,000 in Metabiota through their firm Rosemont Seneca and raised several million dollars in funding for the company from investment giants including Goldman Sachs. The Daily Mail also quotes US government spending records indicating that the Pentagon awarded a $18.4 million contract to Metabiota between February 2014 and November 2016, with $307,091 earmarked for ""Ukraine research projects"". Former senior CIA officer Sam Faddis, cited by the Daily Mail, notes that even though the Pentagon insists that that there's nothing nefarious occurring in Ukraine and the biolabs are simply focused on pandemic early warning research, ""we don't know for sure that's all that was going on"". The Pentagon has good reason to conceal the truth as it could have potentially violated the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act (BWATA) of 1989, according to Francis Boyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law who drafted the law in question. Boyle expresses scepticism about the possibility of the Pentagon being held accountable. He recalled that he was the first one to blow the whistle that the anthrax attacks of October 2001 came out of the US Biological Warfare Weapons Lab and programme. ""I did that at a conference at Harvard Divinity School on November 1, 2001, and I gave a couple of interviews and an order was given"", he says. ""And I was never interviewed again by any Western news media source, and the United States government is still lying about the origins of that attack. And they've covered up and they've gotten away with it"". If the news becomes too annoying for the Pentagon and the US government they will find ways to divert public opinion with something ""more newsworthy"", according to Michael Springmann, former American diplomat and political analyst. Now Washington may try to shift the focus by calling for international peacekeepers to enter Ukraine, according to Springmann. ""That would divert attention and then paint the Russians again as aggressors who won't let poor, innocent peacekeepers into the country to ensure that Ukraine will do what the American government wants it to do"", he suggests. Meanwhile, one shouldn't delude oneself into believing that the United Nations – which has repeatedly declined to investigate the issue of the US-funded biolabs in Ukraine – would step forward and call for a new inquiry, according to the observers. ""The United Nations is under the control of the United States"", says Springmann. ""Its headquarters sits in New York City and the United States supplies a good chunk of the UN's budget, and it has a great control over its membership by promising aid or withholding aid or benefits or other things that might be useful to a foreign country"".

Sport’ competition held in Siberia for banned Paralympic athletes.Russian sporting officials have indicated they will welcome similar initiatives in future, inviting athletes from “friendly” nations to take part.In a new poll run by Russian public opinion center VTsIOM, and with the results shared by TASS, almost a quarter (24%) of those surveyed said it was necessary to host events as alternatives to competitions from which Russian athletes are barred.The vast majority of Russians (91%) said they are “more or less informed” about the suspension of Russian athletes and teams from competitions held by the likes of football organizations UEFA and FIFA.More than half of those polled (62%) claimed that Russians would have been suspended from international competitions “in any case,” signaling the overriding belief that various federations already had it in for competitors from Russia.Just under a third of those questioned (32%) believed that the real reason for the swathes of sanctions was solely the Russian military campaign in Ukraine.In some cases, Russian sporting federations have launched appeals with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland to overturn the bans, although bids from the likes of the Russian Football Union (RFU) have thus far been unsuccessful.When asked if Russia should make such efforts “to restore athletes’ rights,” confidence appeared low with just 15% of the 1,600 people polled saying they should resort to such steps.Almost half of those surveyed (48%) felt that attempts to reinstate Russian sporting rights should come in parallel to holding alternative international competitions in Russia."

The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev, however, insists the Russian offensive was unprovoked and has denied allegations that it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

Vovan has confirmed that the platform blocked the channel, saying that YouTube cited a ""violation of community rules"". He also added a link to their clips on the video hosting site RuTube. The channel was removed soon after the pranksters published videos of their conversations with British Secretary of Defence Ben Wallace and Home Secretary Priti Patel, pretending to be Ukrainian PM Denis Shmygal. During the call with Wallace, the UK minister spilled the beans about arms deliveries to Ukraine and London's support for ""Kiev's plans"" to continue with a nuclear programme.  Meanwhile, Patel shared plans to deprive Russian tycoons of their property in the country and promised to keep allies in line, regarding support for Kiev. The minister was also trolled into saying various phrases, including ""Anglichanka gadit!"", a Russian colloquialism meaning ""the Englishwoman makes mischief"" or ""the Englishwoman plays it dirty"", a reference to the 19th-century foreign policy of Queen Victoria against Russia. After the clip of his conversation was published, Wallace claimed the video was ""doctored"" by the Russian state. At the same time, the British Ministry of Defence urged the platform to remove the videos. YouTube removed the channel of Vovan and Lexus amid reports suggesting that the platform may be blocked in Russia, since the video hosting service has already removed multiple channels by Russian media or blocked access to them around the world. This step comes in line with anti-Russian sanctions imposed over Moscow's military operation in Ukraine. The Russian media watchdog Roscomnadzor later slammed YouTube for allowing anti-Russian ads on the platform, which aim to discredit the Russian military and authorities.

In an interview with four Serbian media outlets, including Radio and Television of Serbia, the newspapers Vecernje novosti and Politika, as well as the Tanjug news agency, Lavrov also touched upon the West's sanctions against Russia over its special military operation in Ukraine. When asked about Russia's ""isolation"" in connection with the sanctions, he stressed that there is no such isolation and that his country has ""a huge number of partners in the Asia-Pacific region, in Africa, and Latin America"". According to Lavrov, Russia has ""good relations with the vast majority of organisations that were created by developing countries and, of course, among them are the African Union, and the community of Latin American and Caribbean countries, as well as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and many others"". The Russian foreign minister also dwelled upon the ongoing negotiations between Moscow and Kiev, adding that Russia hopes they will be a success. He made it clear that Moscow is ready to consider different locations for the continuation of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations, including Belgrade. Separately, he focused on a possible meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, which, Lavrov said, is needed as soon as there is clarity on key issues. He added that during the current negotiations with Ukraine, Moscow is obliged to make sure that ""the people in Donbass never again suffer from the Kiev regime"" and that ""Ukraine ceases to be a country that is constantly militarised"" in an attempt to threaten Russia. Lavrov additionally touted Sino-Russian relations, which he said were ""at their best level ever in history"". President Putin announced the beginning of a Russian special operation in Ukraine on 24 February, following a request for assistance from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, which had witnessed weeks of intensifying shelling by the Ukrainian Army.  In a televised address, Putin stressed that the goal of the operation is ""to protect people who have been subjected to abuse, genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years"", adding that for this purpose, Russia ""will strive to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine, as well as bring to justice those who committed numerous bloody crimes against peaceful residents, including citizens of the Russian Federation"".   The Russian Defence Ministry emphasised that the operation only targets Ukraine's military infrastructure with high-precision weapons and that civilians are out of danger.

He claimed Russian troops in Ukraine have experienced this before “on multiple occasions.”During the almost month-long attack on Ukraine, Russia declared a ceasefire on several occasions, stating that a pause in frontline fighting would allow civilians to evacuate affected areas and for humanitarian aid to be brought into Ukrainian cities caught up in the hostilities.Moscow and Kiev repeatedly blamed each other for alleged breaches of ceasefire agreements in various parts of the country. Russia said it believed the Ukrainian government not to be in full control of its units, which count radical nationalists in their ranks. These forces, according to Moscow, are determined to fight to the end and don’t hesitate to hold civilians as human shields and to otherwise undermine efforts to prevent casualties.Russia launched its attack in Ukraine in late February, claiming its neighbor had to be demilitarized and cleansed of radical elements in the military and law enforcement. Kiev called it an unprovoked act of aggression and is backed by Western nations, which have been supplying arms to Ukraine and imposing economic sanctions on Russia.The belligerents have held several rounds of peace talks and have reportedly made progress on formulating a mutually acceptable deal, but have not produced one so far."

To the Ukrainian people, to women raped and killed, to children who are terrified, killed or abandoned, to all those who have lost their lives or forced to flee to other countries.” Ceccano Mayor Roberto Caligiore has now officially revoked the powers of Gizzi, in what some have described as a witch hunt against pro-Russian sentiments, as most Italian politicians have taken a harsh stance against Russia amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.Last week, Italian officials seized over $882 million in assets belonging to wealthy Russians that were placed on the EU blacklists, as relations between the two countries have been sharply deteriorating.Anti-Russian statements in the Italian media have meanwhile been boiling over to the extreme, with one newspaper, La Stampa, receiving a formal complaint from Russia’s ambassador to Italy last week over its headline questioning the possibility of assassinating Russian President Vladimir Putin, with the ambassador claiming it was a violation of the Italian criminal code, as incitement to commit a crime is a punishable offense."

White NATO has not specifically asked for reinforcements yet, Mette Frederiksen expects that they will be needed. “It is clear that we wouldn't not start the work if we didn't have an expectation that we will make use of the decision that has been made,” Mette Frederiksen mused.

Interviewed on Fox News by Tucker Carlson on Monday night, the former Democrat representative for Hawaii addressed Biden's allegedly unscripted remark in a speech in Poland that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power."" The White House and State Department rushed to walk back that comment, along with other where Biden told US troops stationed in eastern Europe they would see what's happening in Ukraine ""when you get there"" and that speculated use of chemical weapons, which Russia does not possess, ""would trigger a response in kind."" ""They are doing so by waging this modern-day siege against Russia, isolating, containing, destroying their economy, starving the Russian people in the hope that the Russian people or the military will rise up and revolt and overthrow their government, and get rid of Putin"", she charged. Gabbard said the Biden administration was lying about its true intentions for fear of further alienating voters anxious about the conflict in Ukraine escalating to a nuclear war between NATO and Russia. ""The reason why they are lying about this to the American people, is, they know we are sick and tired of our country waging regime change wars"", she said. ""We remember how costly and devastating these wars in Iraq, Libya, Syria have been. And we rejected them wholeheartedly"". ""If they were to come out and tell the truth, their polls would tank even more than they already are, and their politics would suffer"", Gabbard stressed. ""The American people are smart enough to know that a regime change war against a nuclear-armed Russia is very different from any other that’s been waged before, and will result in disastrous consequences that go beyond anything we could even imagine"". Biden faced a rare moment of difficult questioning from journalists a White House press conference on Monday. He refused to say how the US would respond to a hypothetical chemical warfare attack, which Russia has warned Ukrainian forces ate planning as a 'false flag' provocation, calling one reporter ""silly"" and insisting he was going to keep the world guessing. ""I'm not walking anything back"", he claimed, insisting he was venting his ""moral outrage"" and not ""articulating a policy change"", while admitting that ""nobody believes"" the US could ""take down"" Putin.

Bolton was US ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, and served as national security adviser to former President Donald Trump.  His tenure as national security adviser was cut short in September 2019 when he was unceremoniously fired in a Twitter post in which Trump wrote that he'd ""informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House"". Within months, Bolton was making appearances on political talk shows publicising his then-upcoming ""tell-all"" book in which he accused President Trump of wanting to ""continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including the Bidens"". The claim played a key role in the first of President Trump's two impeachments, because it appeared to validate some of the still-unproven allegations of impropriety surrounding weapons shipments which Democrats in Congress wanted the president to send to the Ukrainian regime. President Trump's response was immediate. The then-president promptly took to Twitter to allege that Bolton ""begged"" him for a job and that ""frankly"", if he had ""listened to [Bolton], we would be in World War Six by now"". Bolton's longstanding antipathy towards perceived enemy governments wasn't limited to the Russian leadership. ""The president was angered by Bolton's opposition"" to President Trump's proposed Afghanistan peace deal, PBS wrote at the time of Bolton's dismissal, and it reportedly wasn't the first time the two men clashed over Bolton's apparent refusal to cooperate with the White House's geopolitical vision.  It wasn't just the Trump crowd – Bolton's reputation for bellicosity earned him the ire of anti-intervention conservatives and liberals alike. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Moscow launched a military attack on its neighbor late last month.“We're convinced that putting [the terms] before the public at this moment can only undermine the negotiations that are already going a lot slower and are less substantial than we want them to be,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.Zelensky has suggested that peace terms of “historical” importance may be the subject of a referendum. “The people will have to respond to certain ... compromises,” he told reporters on Monday, adding that the details were still dependent on talks with Moscow.The Ukrainian leader has previously proposed various plebiscites that have never come to fruition. The Russian and Ukrainian delegations held several rounds of talks in Belarus, in person, before eventually switching to discussions via video link, in a bid to speed up the process. Zelensky reiterated that Kiev was seeking security guarantees from Russia and the West. Moscow, meanwhile, said that it wanted Ukraine to officially become a neutral country, renouncing its bid to join NATO, a US-led military bloc that Russia views as a threat.Moscow further said it wanted the “demilitarization” and “denazification” of Ukraine, as well as for Kiev to recognize Crimea as a part of Russia, and the republics in Donetsk (DPR) and Lugansk (LPR) as independent states.Crimea, which was transferred to Kiev's control when both countries were part of the USSR, voted to leave Ukraine and join Russia shortly after the 2014 coup in Kiev, which overthrew an elected government. The Donbass republics broke away from Ukraine the same year, with tacit Russian support. Moscow attacked Ukraine on February 24, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk peace agreements and Russia’s eventual recognition of the DPR and LPR's independence. The internationally-brokered deals were meant make them autonomous regions within Ukraine.Kiev says that the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

Then the Misfits talk about whether the rhetoric in the mainstream media about a “New World Order” is a call for regime change in Russia. Next, Garett Reppenhagen, Director of Veterans for Peace joins the show to talk about the volunteers and for hire mercenaries fighting against Russians in Ukraine. There is a stream of reports about volunteers in the region that coordination is pretty chaotic. The Misfits talk about the formal military contractors such as Blackwater’s Erik Prince which for nearly a year now plans to build a private army in Ukraine. And, the BBC earlier this month reported on ads for military contractors to help extract families from Ukraine. Later on the show, Juan Jose Gutierrez, immigration lawyer, executive director of the Full Rights for Immigrants Coalition joins the conversation to talk about GOP Latinos. Republicans and Democrats both need the Hispanic vote to win in competitive elections. And, the Misfits discuss strategies that both parties will probably employ to court the Latino vote for the 2022 midterms. For the last segment, Dan Lazare, writer and journalist, calls into the program to talk about Stormy Daniels ordered to pay Trump’s legal fees after her defamation case was overturned. Then the Misfits talk about trade relations with Iran and the nuclear agreement.

Some 71% of respondents indicated that they believe their country is ""on the wrong track"". Americans were specifically concerned by issues related to the economy, with 64% disapproving of Biden's handling of it. 62% said that their income has shrunk amid the growing cost of living. A majority of respondents considered this to be the most important issue facing the US. The poll also showed that Americans generally disapprove of the POTUS' handling of foreign policy issues, with 51% believing that he has underperformed in this sphere. The respondents also negatively evaluated Biden's policy on Ukraine, as only 28% assessed it positively. The latest data shows that the Biden administration and the Democratic Party he represents are set for a crushing defeat in the upcoming midterms this year, Republican pollster, Bill McInturff, said in a comment for NBC. The NBC poll generally confirmed McInturff's projections, as the GOP was shown to be leading  by two points ahead of the Democrats on the question of which party respondents want to win control of Congress.

He pointed the finger at Biden, arguing that POTUS is now afraid of attacking a ""nuclear power"", in an apparent reference to Russia. Trump also asserted that under his presidency, the Ukraine crisis would have never taken place, claiming that Moscow's special operation came after Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly saw Washington's ""weakness"". Additionally, Trump alleged that it was he, who initiated the beginning of US arms deliveries to Ukraine, including ""hundreds"" of Javelin portable anti-tank missile systems. The remarks followed the former POTUS telling his supporters at a rally in Florence, South Carolina, last week that ""despite all of Biden's weakness, cowardice, and incompetence, there is still a path for him to end this tragedy in Ukraine, without getting Americans snared in a gruesome and very bloody war"". This followed Biden saying in late February that he does not believe Americans have reason to be concerned about a nuclear war amid tensions with Russia over its special operation in Ukraine. Earlier that month, Putin said he had ordered ""the deterrence forces of the Russian Army to a special mode of combat duty"", due to ""aggressive statements"" by NATO leaders. Moscow's special operation, which has been underway since 24 February, was launched after the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for help in defending themselves against Kiev's forces. Russia said that the aim of the operation is to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine and that only the nation's military infrastructure is being targeted. The Kremlin has repeatedly stressed that it has no plans to occupy Ukraine. According to President Putin, the operation's goal is to protect the people of Donbass, ""who have been subjected to abuse, genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years"". In response, Western countries have rolled out a full-blown sanctions campaign against Moscow, which includes airspace closures and restrictive measures targeting numerous Russian officials and entities, media, and financial institutions.

You understand, this is not just a suspension for six months, everything was planned. “The idea was to prevent me from playing in the Candidates Tournament and to deprive me of a possible entry into the [world title] match with Magnus Carlsen. “I don't know if I'll be returning in six months to tournaments under the auspices of FIDE. They dishonored not me, but themselves. “I just don't remember such a precedent when a chess player was not allowed on principle. It’s a shame.""Karjakin also suggested that the decision from FIDE, which has a Russian president in Arkady Dvorkovich, was politically motivated.“It's just the idea – Dvorkovich is trying to show that he is a European official. He wants to remain FIDE president. He decided to sacrifice me for his political ambitions,"" he said.The FIDE suspension comes after the group unanimously decided that Karjakin's statements in support of the Russian military operation in Ukraine were in breach of its Code of Ethics. Elsewhere, fellow Russian grandmaster Sergey Shipov, who was also the subject of a FIDE investigation due to pro-Russia statements, was not issued with a suspension after it was found that his statements were supposedly less provocative. “The statements by Sergey Karjakin on the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine has led to a considerable number of reactions on social media and elsewhere, to a large extent negative towards the opinions expressed by Sergey Karjakin,"" said FIDE in a lengthy document explaining its decision.Karjakin has 21 days to appeal the judgement, with the Russian Chess Federation saying that it intended to do so in the near future.Karjakin, though, sees any appeal as being entirely futile.“I don’t see the point of filing an appeal – any court will take the side of Europe. And FIDE is an international sports organization that does like everyone else. And by some coincidence, a Russian is still leading it. I think that this is not for long,” said Karjakin.“I understood that there was such a danger [of disqualification], but I believe that I am first and foremost a citizen and patriot of my country, and I say this without any boasting. If such a situation arose again, I would not be silent, but again I would write such a letter. I do not regret what I did. Choosing between supporting my country and participating in the Candidates Tournament, I would always choose the first one,"" he added.Statements made by Karjakin in the last three weeks are central to FIDE's decision to ban him.Shortly after the onset of the operation in Ukraine, he shared an open letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, writing: ""I appeal to you at this difficult time, when our country, led by you, is fighting for the safety of the peaceful Russian population of Donbass and the Lugansk People’s Republic.“It is fighting for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine with its ruling regime, which has put the security of all of Europe and our country at risk, for the sake of its political goals and ambitions.“I am closely following the ongoing special operation, in the lands where I spent my childhood, where I learned to play chess and where my relatives still live.“For eight long years we have been waiting with hope for salvation from countless shelling and loss of human lives, the ongoing genocide by the still acting Kiev regime.“I express to you, our commander-in-chief, full support in protecting the interests of Russia, our multinational Russian people, eliminating threats and establishment of peace! I wish you the speedy fulfilment of all the tasks assigned to our valiant army.""Россия ❤️🙏✊🏻 pic.twitter.com/ToU01jVCAwKarjakin, who is a former world rapid chess and blitz champion, said he had received death threats after he pronounced his support of Putin and the military operation in Ukraine, saying that he had been targeted with ""thousands"" of messages from what he described as ""hysterical"" people.FIDE have previously announced a ban of Russia and Belarus from team events, but had allowed individual players from those countries to compete as neutrals. "

Poland will now host the final on March 29.The Russian Football Union is still hopeful of succeeding in an appeal to CAS over the suspensions and has called FIFA's move divisive, discriminatory and harmful to the sport.Russia's hopes of reaching the finals in November and December appear to be all-but over as a result of the CAS decision.Former Russia midfielder Karpin extended his contract with the national side on March 10 but described the appeal situation as ""hopeless"".Karpin has returned to managing former club Rostov, of the Russian Premier League, but had been on standby if Russia's appeal succeeded.The 53-year-old was appointed national team manager in July and was only denied an automatic place at the finals by a late Croatia goal in Russia's final group stage qualification game in Zagreb.Ukraine were also due to travel to Scotland for a playoff semifinal on Thursday which has been postponed.The winners of the tie will visit Wales or Austria to decide whether they will reach the finals.The Russia women's national team are out of the Euro finals in England in July, with Ukraine among the teams who could replace them in an anticipated UEFA draw to decide an additional entrant.Spartak Moscow were also eliminated from their Europa League round of 16 tie with RB Leipzig.St. Petersburg had been due to host the Champions League final in May, which UEFA moved to Paris a day after the conflict in Ukraine began on February 24."

However, no suspension of the Football Russian Union was imposed at that time,” a statement read, according to ESPN. “The UEFA Executive Committee will however remain on standby to convene further extraordinary meetings, on a regular ongoing basis where required, to reassess the legal and factual situation as it evolves and adopt further decisions as necessary, including in light of the declaration of interest expressed by the Russian Football Union for hosting the UEFA Euro.”Russian football officials said on Wednesday that they had a right to express interest in the events, and that the current situation should not preclude their potential hosting of tournaments.“We are open and ready, we should not be closed to UEFA and FIFA,” said RFU Executive Committee member Rustem Saymanov.   “We've held lots of competitions at a high level… There’s a lot of time, the situation will change, we will study everything.”Elsewhere, the likes of former Zenit St. Petersburg and Arsenal star Andrey Arshavin admitted that Russia’s chances of being granted the Euros were “slim” but that things could change for the better.UEFA is set to confirm the names of the countries involved in the full bidding process on April 5, before confirming the hosts in September.Russia was widely seen as successfully welcoming the 2018 FIFA World Cup – which many considered among the best-ever editions of the tournament – while St. Petersburg held seven matches at Euro 2020 last summer.The current bans on Russia mean that the men’s national team is set to miss out on the chance to qualify for the 2022 FIFA Qatar World Cup, after an RFU appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) was rejected.St. Petersburg was also stripped of the 2022 UEFA Champions League final, which has been relocated to Paris."

However, American imports would cover just a fraction of Europe’s energy demand.The deal is expected to be announced officially by US President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later on Friday.Under the agreement, the parties are to form a special working group to monitor Europe’s energy needs. Sources also say that the deal provides for increasing US LNG exports for 2023.The United States has already banned Russian energy imports, with the UK voicing plans to follow suit by year’s end. However, European countries have not reached common ground on the matter, with many fearing that energy prices could spike ever higher after already breaking a record earlier this month. Prices skyrocketed after Russia was sanctioned over the launch of a military operation in Ukraine, sparking fears of gas supply disruptions.Europe gets over 40% of its total natural gas imports from Russia, having bought around 155 billion cubic meters of gas in 2021. Meanwhile, US LNG exports to the EU were a little over 22 billion cubic meters last year. According to sources, US President Joe Biden on Thursday said his country would increase LNG deliveries by 15 billion cubic meters this year, but analysts say the US is already producing the commodity at full capacity, and that for any additional gas to go to Europe it would have to be taken from exports initially aimed for other buyers.Meanwhile, Russia on Wednesday said it is set to change existing gas contracts and demand that states that imposed sanctions on the country pay for the commodity in rubles. The announcement puzzled Russia’s gas buyers and drew further concerns of potential disruptions to Europe's gas supply.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

And that's one of the things that we have said, that our president has said, that we weren't going to do,” the defense secretary said.In order to control the skies, you have to shut down the air defenses that are on the ground and some of those air defense systems are in Russia. And, so again, there's no easy or simple way to do this. No, there's no such thing as a no-fly zone light. A no fly zone means that you're in a conflict with Russia.Austin went on to note that while there are some “effective” means of defense against long-range missiles and artillery, a no-fly zone would be of little help against such weapons, namely when they are used from within Russian territory.“The rockets are actually cruise missiles… that were fired from aerial platforms, I think you know that those were fired from actually inside of Russia, so a no-fly zone would not have prevented that activity,” he continued.President Biden has been under increasing pressure to step up US aid to Kiev, having already sent hundreds of millions in arms and other military hardware prior to a new $800 million weapons package this week. The latest shipment includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems – a newer addition to Ukraine’s arsenal – as well as thousands of tank-killing Javelin missiles. In an address to American lawmakers on Wednesday, Zelensky again pleaded for a no-fly zone enforced by the NATO bloc, though acknowledged the move is a red line for the Biden administration. The US president was apparently not persuaded by the latest appeal, as White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that an NFZ was still not an option soon after Zelensky’s address, stating “We are not interested in getting into World War III.” Nonetheless, the defense secretary said Washington would continue to “do everything within our power to support Ukraine in their efforts to defend their territory,” including by reinforcing the Ukrainian military with arms and munitions, as well as helping to “backfill” the armories of foreign allies who provide weapons of their own. Russia sent troops into Ukraine in late February, claiming the government in Kiev had failed to live up to peace deals to end fighting with two breakaway republics in the Donbass region while setting out to “demilitarize” and “denazify” the country. Ukraine says the attack was unprovoked and insists it had no plans to reclaim the separatist areas by force, a stance echoed by the United States and a long list of allies, who have retaliated with a raft of harsh sanctions in addition to the ongoing arms shipments."

According to officials on both sides, Kiev promised not to join NATO while Moscow agreed not to oppose Ukraine entering the EU, among other terms. Kiev also proposed security guarantees for Ukraine with the UN Security Council members acting as guarantors - along with Turkey, Germany, Canada, Italy, Poland, and Israel. In addition, the Russian delegation said a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is possible after the parties agree to a deal. Roberts said it is also unclear how Ukraine can be in the EU and remain neutral considering Austria, which is in a similar situation, agreed to impose sanctions on Russia. Moscow, he added, must deal decisively with the Ukraine issue now and leave no room for its reappearance. The former US official also said Russia should consider if Ukraine can be trusted to keep this agreement when Kiev refused to abide the terms of the Minsk accords. Besides, he added, Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said many times it was a mistake to trust the West. ""There were guarantors of the Minsk agreement, and they did nothing,"" Roberts said. ""So why repeat the mistake again?"" "

The beneficiary charities will be announced in due course after consultation with the club,"" it was concluded.While Chelsea still cannot sell buy or sell players, nor sell extra tickets to their fans for home games that were previously only attended by season ticket holders, the fresh measures are still a boost to the club.Chelsea supporters can now head out on the road to back Thomas Tuchel's men in important fixtures against Southampton, Leeds United, Everton and Manchester United as they look to secure third place in the Premier League. No less importantly, they can cheer on the Blues at Stamford Bridge as their Champions League title defense continues in the quarter-finals against 13-times winners Real Madrid on April 6, and then at the Bernabeu six days later after it was previously feared the fixture might have to be played behind closed doors. Chelsea fans can also attend an FA Cup semi-final date with cross-city rivals Crystal Palace after the Madrid return leg on April 16, though it is possible that the club might have been sold then to its first owners since Abramovich took over the reins in 2003 and began a 21-trophy dynasty.The amendments to the license come after the FA stated it hoped to have a sell-out crowd at the Wembley last four showdown and that it was ""working with the Government on a method to achieve this whilst respecting the sanctions that are currently in place on Chelsea.""And while the Ricketts family, Chelsea fan John Candy, and a Todd Boehly and Hansjorg Wyss consortium battle it out to take over at Stamford Bridge, Abramovich is reported to be lining up his next pet project.According to Turkish outlet Fanatik, the Russian is putting the wheels in motion to buy Turkish outfit Goztepe who currently languish in 18th in the Super Lig relegation zone."

Putin described its goals as the demilitarisation and de-Nazification of Ukraine. ,"Setting free the people of Donbass from the ""genocide"" being waged against them is the main goal of the Russian special operation in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated during an address in Luzhniki Stadium. Putin went on to add that the demilitarisation and de-Nazification of Ukraine will be carried out and all ""war criminals"" responsible for the bloodshed in Donbass, will be punished. He clarified that it was the only way to stop the ""genocide"" there. The Russian president ordered the start of the special operation in Ukraine on 24 February following a request from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) to protect them from attacks by Ukrainian forces and nationalist battalions. Putin stated that Russia was left with no other choice but to intervene to help the newly-recognised Donbass republics. He described the goals of the operation as the demilitarisation and de-Nazification of Ukraine and vowed that the Russian armed forces will only be targeting military objectives. The Kremlin has also repeatedly rejected claims by foreign governments and media outlets that the operation was a Russian ""invasion"" stressing that Russian troops do not have a goal of seizing Ukraine and only seek to disarm it and eliminate the nationalist threat. Despite this, nations in the West slapped Russia with the harshest economic sanctions to date, targeting the banking and energy sectors of the economy, as well as the Central Bank and illegally freezing Russia's foreign reserves.

He said a simple “commitment of no eastward expansion could have easily ended the crisis and stopped the suffering.”“Instead, one chose to fan the flames at a safe distance, watching its own arms dealers, bankers, and oil tycoons make a fortune out of the war, while leaving the people of a small country with the wounds of war that would take years to heal,” he said.NATO’s pursuit of “absolute security” leads instead to “absolute non-security,” Le added.The consequences of forcing a major power, especially a nuclear power, into a corner are even more unimaginable.Moscow has vehemently opposed NATO’s presence close to its borders, and embarked on a mission to obtain written guarantees that would halt the US-led military bloc’s expansion and bar Ukraine from joining its ranks. However, the West ignored Russia’s concerns.Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “special military operation” on February 24, with a stated goal to “demilitarize and denazify” Ukraine, ensuring it no longer posed a threat to either Russia or the newly recognized Donbass republics, which have suffered seven years of grueling siege. The US and its NATO allies have accused Russia of starting an “unprovoked” war to conquer and subsume Ukraine. Moscow has seen thousands of harsh new curbs and sanctions slapped on it as a result, with the US, the EU, and others seeking to “isolate” and “destroy” the Russian economy.“History has proven time and again that sanctions cannot solve problems,” Le said. “The sanctions against Russia are getting more and more outrageous ... Sanctions will only harm ordinary people, impact the economic and financial system ... and worsen the global economy.”Beijing has come under increased pressure from the West to distance itself from Moscow and sever its trade ties, after China abstained from a United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning Russia’s military action in Ukraine, choosing to remain neutral, alongside India, Pakistan, South Africa, and 30 other countries.In a video conference call with Biden on Friday, Xi stressed that China had always stood “for peace and opposes war,” and urged all parties involved in the conflict to return to diplomacy. In response, Biden warned him that Beijing would face “consequences” should it provide material support to Russia or help it evade Western sanctions."

Except since it was NATO doing them to Yugoslavia, Madeleine Albright was a hero and an icon, obviously.On March 24, 1999, NATO launched an air war against Serbia and Montenegro, then known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The publicly stated aim of Operation Allied Force was to compel Belgrade to accept the ultimatum given at the French chateau of Rambouillet the month before: Hand the province of Kosovo over to NATO “peacekeepers” and allow ethnic Albanian separatists to declare independence. When the bombers failed to achieve that within a couple of weeks, the narrative changed to NATO acting to stop a “genocide” of Albanians its cheerleader press claimed was taking place. That narrative also credited the first-ever female US secretary of state for the “humanitarian” bombing, calling it “Madeleine’s War.” In the end, it took 78 days and a negotiated armistice for NATO troops to enter Kosovo wearing the fig leaf of a UN peacekeeping mission. They promptly turned the province over to the “Kosovo Liberation Army” terrorists, who proceeded to burn, loot, murder and expel over 200,000 non-Albanians. A real campaign of terror, intimidation, ethnic cleansing and pogroms began – and the very same media that covered for NATO by making up atrocities during the bombing now turned a blind eye, for the same reason.Whatever its outcome, however, it was an evil little war, launched because the US felt it could. Because Washington wanted to get rid of the restraints posed by the UN to its new global hegemony, articulated just a few years earlier by Bill Kristol and Victoria Nuland’s husband Robert Kagan. Because the rising American Empire wanted to send a message to Eastern Europe that no dissent would be tolerated, and to Russia that it was no longer a great power worth respecting. A legalistic mind might point out that the attack violated Articles 2, 53 and 103 of the UN Charter, NATO’s own charter – the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 (articles 1 and 7) – as well as the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 (violating the territorial integrity of a signatory state) and the 1980 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, for using coercion to compel a state to sign a treaty. Ah, but being a world empire means making its own “rules-based order” to supplant inconvenient laws. So an “independent commission” of cheerleaders was put together to declare the operation “illegal but legitimate,” arguing it was justified because it “liberated” the Kosovo Albanians from Serb “oppression.”The actual oppression of non-Albanians as NATO troops stood idly by – including during the vicious pogrom of March 2004 – doesn’t count, obviously. The important thing is that Bill and Hillary Clinton, Madeleine Albright, and British PM Tony Blair got monuments, streets, and even children named after them.The “independent” Kosovo – proclaimed in 2008, in a move about as legal as the 1999 war – can’t actually do anything without the permission of the US ambassador. A great triumph of human rights, law and order, and democracy, everyone!NATO never cared about saving Albanian lives. If it did, it wouldn’t have partnered with the KLA, which made a point of murdering ethnic Albanians who wanted peace with the Serbs. It wouldn’t have repeatedly bombed refugee columns, then declaring it was really the Serbs’ fault somehow and that pilots dropped their bombs “in good faith” – literally something NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said on one occasion. Twenty years on and nothing has changed. Having obliterated a family in Kabul by a drone strike last August, the US offered blood money, but refused to so much as reprimand anyone involved. Being an empire means never having to say you’re sorry. This mindset propelled the invasion of Iraq in 2003.Meanwhile, failure to overthrow the government in Belgrade through war led to a “color revolution” in Serbia instead. It was then exported to other places – including Ukraine, twice. That 2014 coup in Kiev literally started the conflict in eastern Ukraine, of which the current events are but the latest phase.In March 1999, I was a student in the American Midwest, and had been (almost) successfully brainwashed into believing the platitudes about freedom, democracy, tolerance, objectivity, rules and laws, and how the US was a “force for good” in the world. Then, overnight, people I thought had been my friends called me a monster and believed every single bit of propaganda that came off the TV screens and newspaper pages. I’ve made justice and remembrance something of my life mission since then, seeking to explain that rather than a good, noble and humanitarian war, Kosovo represented everything wrong about the modern world: “A monument to the power of lies, the successful murder of law, and the triumph of might over justice,” as I wrote in 2005, and repeated every year since.The twist this year is that the people shrieking about human rights, international law and the sanctity of borders – when it comes to their client regime in Ukraine, that is – were all cheering for NATO back in 1999. Even now, they won’t apologize for it, much less disavow. So it seems it’s not really about what is being done, only who is doing it to whom. While I understand their anger as the world their lies propped up comes crashing down, they hardly have standing to complain."

The volumes of Iran's obscured trade might have reached ""tens of billions of dollars"" and effectively allowed the country to restore the economy tanked by the sanctions and practically return it to the levels before the economic measures against it were re-introduced. While Iran never hid the fact that it had discovered a way to continue trading despite the American sanctions, it never revealed the scheme. The WSJ describes the system organised by the Islamic Republic as a combination of Iranian companies' proxies, accounts in foreign banks and internal transactions inside Iran itself recorded on a separate secret ledger. Iranian banks reportedly serve as bridges between sanctioned companies and the firms that can maintain some connections with the outside world. The latter create companies outside the Islamic Republic to act on behalf of the sanctioned Iranian firms, the newspaper's investigation and accounts of Western officials suggest. These proxies then engage in trade with foreign companies selling oil and Iranian commodities, the WSJ reported. A small portion of the proceeds from this trade is reportedly being smuggled into Iran in the form of currency which is used, among other things, to boost the exchange rate of Iran's rial, which also plummeted in 2018. However, the majority of the cash remains in foreign banks. These dollars, euros and other currencies are then used to buy imports for the Islamic republic. The sanctioned Iranian companies also trade this foreign-stashed currency with each other using ledgers that do not leave Iran. While the Iranian shadow trading and financial system shows the limits of the US sanctions campaign, it also has its downsides, the newspaper said. According to its sources, both in Western countries and in Iran, this system is inefficient and is susceptible to corruption. However, despite these drawbacks, Tehran is likely to leave it in place – even if it negotiates the restoration of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with the US and the remaining signatories of the original 2015 nuclear accord, the WSJ sources said. The existing system will reportedly be kept in place as a safeguard in case the JCPOA parties decide to slap Iran with sanctions again, as well as to keep some of Tehran's transactions obscured. Moreover, even with the sanctions lifted, foreign companies are unlikely to be quick to return to the Iranian market, fearful of the remaining sanctions and accidently violating the US rules with regards to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which Washington recognises as a terrorist organisation. With this secret economic vehicle in place, Iran's trade with foreign countries reached $80 billion a year in 2021, according to a senior Iranian politician, Gholamreza Mesbahi-Moghaddam. The figure could grow to almost twice that level in 2022, the International Monetary Fund has estimated.  Let's stay in touch no matter what!

","The US and the EU have announced the creation of a 'task force' to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian gas.  US President Joe Biden said during his meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday that ""we are coming together to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian energy"". Von der Leyen, for her part, said that she expects US gas to replace Russian gas in the EU.  According to the White House's statement, ""the United States will work with international partners and strive to ensure additional LNG volumes for the EU market of at least 15 bcm in 2022, with expected increases going forward."" Russia supplies 40% of the EU's gas and over a quarter of the oil it imports. Also on Friday, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo commented on the EU's plans to reduce the impact of high energy prices on consumers, saying that the EU needed to ""buy together and intervene in the market to reduce prices"".  Natural gas prices in Europe have been rising dramatically since last year over growing energy demand, amid an economic recovery after months of COVID lockdowns and a limited supply. The need for the EU's energy security became even more pressing amid Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, and unprecedented sanctions imposed by the US and its allies against Russia. "

The punitive measures either completely ban or severely restrict dealing with Russian key export sales, including oil and steel.Meanwhile, ships loaded with at least 1.06 million tons of coking and thermal coal, which is used primarily for electricity generation, are set to moor along Indian shores this month, according to data from Kpler, as quoted by Reuters.The international consultancy highlighted that the freight was the biggest since January 2020.Russia, ranked as India’s sixth-largest supplier of coking and thermal coal, is expected to offer more competitive prices to Chinese and Indian partners as European and other buyers turn away from the country due to the sanctions.Trade between the nations is also projected to increase thanks to a rouble-rupee trading arrangement.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

According to Coldiretti, for every euro spent by consumers on food products, only between six and 15 cents go to farmers. The price of bread, for instance, is now nearly 13 times the cost of wheat.The group does not propose any solutions to the problem, but paints a dramatic scenario in which the closure of farms would lead to a decrease in crops and force the country to depend even more on agricultural imports. Italy already buys 64% of its grain abroad, as well as 49% of beef and 38% of pork. It also imports over half the corn crops and a third of the soy crops required for animal nutrition, according to the Centro Studi Divulga. And these figures, analysts say, may soon rise dramatically.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

The delegation arrived on the island on 1 March to deliver ""a message of reassurance"" to Taipei amid ""China’s growing military threat,"" according to the Guardian. Beijing denounced the move as violating China's national sovereignty: ""The attempt by the US to show support to Taiwan will be in vain, no matter who the US sends. The Chinese people are firmly determined and resolved to defend (their) national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin stated on 2 March. At the same time, reports started to emerge in the US media about the US Indo-Pacific Command's (INDOPACOM) plan to spend $27 billion over the next six years to ""deter China"" in the Pacific region. According to the Drive, the DoD's recent plan is an expansion of the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, or PDI, which was included by the US Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for the 2021 Fiscal Year. The new grand design envisages spending between $27.3 billion and $27.4 billion in total through Fiscal Year 2027. ""This includes $2.2 billion to be spent in the 2021 Fiscal Year and another $4.6 billion expected to be available in the next fiscal cycle,"" the media specifies. In particular, the plan envisions the creation of ""highly survivable, precision-strike networks along the First Island Chain, featuring increased quantities of ground-based weapons,"" referring to an area of the Pacific inside a boundary formed by the first line of archipelagos out from mainland East Asia. This area includes the contested South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. According to the Drive, in general, the initiative ""include[s] the establishment of forward-deployed long-range strike capabilities, including elements that could be armed ground-based cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic missiles"" as well as ""more capable missile defences,"" ""space-based and terrestrial sensors"". Meanwhile, the US Senate on 10 March poked Beijing by passing an amendment prohibiting the State Department from purchasing any map that ""inaccurately depicts the territory and social and economic system of Taiwan and the islands or island groups administered by Taiwan authorities"". According to Taiwan Times, the vague text actually meant maps depicting ""Taiwan as part of China"". The Chinese Foreign Ministry on 14 March strongly opposed the US congressional maps bans, stressing that ""there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, which is both a historical and legal fact and the consensus of the international community."" The Western media continued to ramp up the narrative about China's alleged ""bellicose"" plans with regard to Taiwan with the Business Insider warning on 10 March that after the beginning of the Russian special operation in Ukraine ""US officials have also been watching China closely, looking for signs that Beijing is capitalising on turmoil in Europe to strike Taiwan."" On 16 March, Newsweek claimed that Chinese President Xi Jinping ""had plans to annex"" the Taiwan island in autumn 2022 but that Russia's special operation in Ukraine ""shut"" this ""window of opportunity"" for Beijing. To back this claim Newsweek cited ""a purported Russian intelligence document"" written by ""an anonymous analyst with Russia's Federal Security Service"" (FSB). Newsweek made it clear that it ""wasn't able to independently verify the authenticity of the FSB letter."" Instead, the media quoted Christo Grozev, the executive director of Bellingcat, who said that his ""FSB contacts"" alleged that the ""whistleblower"" in question was authentic but did not agree with the conclusions of his analysis. However, Bellingcat could hardly be regarded as objective and independent, according to independent investigative reporters of Grayzone. Grayzone journalists previously detailed how Bellingcat covertly cooperated with the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), received funding from Western intelligence contractors and the US government’s National Endowment for Democracy, ""employed a staggering number of former [Western] military and intelligence operatives,"" and peddled unconfirmed and dubious narratives about Russia and Syria. The Chinese officials have repeatedly shredded the Western claims of Beijing's war plans concerning Taiwan, adding that there are no links between Russia's special operation to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine and China's relations with its island. In his 15 March op-ed for The Washington Post, Qin Gang, the ambassador of the People’s Republic of China to the United States, also rubbished claims of China's alleged foreknowledge of the Russian Ukraine operation. The Chinese top diplomat underscored that Taiwan is a ""Chinese internal affair"". According to The Global Times, Washington's attempts to poke Beijing over Taiwan are part of the US attempts to force China to join the US sanctions spree against Russia over Ukraine.

The operation was prompted by a request from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) to defend them against attacks by Kiev's forces.,"Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has stated that Russia has completed the main objectives of the first phase of the special military operation currently being carried out in Ukraine. The combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces has been significantly reduced and now Russian forces can focus on achieving the main goal – ""the liberation of Donbass"", Shoigu said during a meeting at the Defence Ministry. The Russian minister noted that the Ukrainian Air Force and air defences have been practically eliminated and its navy ceased to exist following the start of the operation. Shoigu also reported successes in combating foreign mercenaries that arrived in Ukraine over the past month. Some 600 foreign mercenaries were killed and 500 more decided to leave Ukraine voluntarily, the minister said. The Russian defence minister further condemned the West's decision to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine, calling the move ""reckless"". He noted that Kiev is ""mindlessly"" handing out those weapons to the local population and mercenaries, adding that this might create threats to Europeans themselves in the future. Russia will also respond ""adequately"" if foreign countries start supplying Ukraine with jets and air defence systems, Shoigu said without elaborating further. So far, the West has only supplied man-portable anti-air weapons to Ukraine and refrained from shipping any fighter jets amid fears of escalating tensions with Moscow. Shoigu further pointed to the ""mindless"" use of certain weapons by Ukraine in various regions. Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February in response to a request from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) to defend them against attacks by the Ukrainian military and nationalist battalions. Both republics had suffered from intense shelling for over a week by that moment. Announcing the operation, Russian President Vladimir Putin described its main goals as the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine. The Russian delegation at the peace talks with Kiev discussed the county's neutral status and refusal to join NATO, as one of the key points for an agreement that would end the special operation.

The bombing continued for 78 days and ended with a negotiated armistice, allowing UN peacekeepers into the rebel province of Kosovo.Because Russia was weak and ruled by the “Western oligarchy” propping up President Boris Yeltsin, Serbia was “absolutely alone” in fighting for its freedom, borders and survival, Kusturica told RT from his home in Mecavnik.This was “when international law was changed to what I call ‘humanitarian’ law,” the filmmaker said, alluding to NATO’s official reasoning that it was trying to stop a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo, and the subsequent doctrine of “responsibility to protect” created to justify the war. “This war did not just come out of nowhere. This is a continuation of something seeded much earlier,” the director said, referring to the current conflict over Ukraine. Kusturica sees a continuity of Russophobia in the West, which rejected Russia’s offer of partnership after the Cold War.NATO claimed the bombing brought peace, but the only thing it achieved was to enable the October 2000 color revolution, Kusturica noted. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was overthrown in what would become a template for two such revolts in Ukraine, first in 2004 and then in 2014. Bombing of Serbia was just the first act, now we’re witnessing the second act of the same story.Serbs aren’t pro-war, they just remember 1999 and understand the causes of the current conflict in Ukraine, Kusturica told RT.“In a unipolar world, nobody is paying a price for [their] moves,” he pointed out. “Now we’re facing the deconstruction of power around the world, and what matters I think in the end is what kind of weapons you have.”Back in 1999, Serbia did not have the most modern weapons – Yeltsin blocked the delivery of air defense systems that might have made more of a difference, Kusturica said. Even so, the Serbs managed to shoot down a US “stealth” bomber. They remember NATO’s “humanitarian” bombs even today, he added.“They never came on the ground, because they know how the Serbian people fight,” Kusturica pointed out.Yugoslavia ended in 2006, when Montenegro declared independence. The ethnic Albanian provisional government in Kosovo – backed by NATO – did so in 2008, though without recognition from Belgrade. Serbia is now an “island” in a sea of NATO states on almost all sides. Yet it is still a place where not all media are under Western control, and where one can still raise a voice against injustice and censorship, Kusturica said.He condemned what he described as an “almost incredibly satanic version of cancel culture” that now bans Russian conductors, composers and authors, stopping just short of burning books in city squares like the Nazis used to do. Russian authors like “Chekhov, Pushkin, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy are inseparable from what we call European culture,” Kusturica said, arguing the West is now attempting to cut them off, but that the world will “eventually see these pieces coming back together.”Born in what is today Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kusturica made his first feature film in 1981, going on to direct a series of award-winning features and try his hand at acting, music and writing as well. He resides in an ethnic-themed village in western Serbia, originally built as the set for his 2003 film ‘Life is a Miracle’."

This, in turn, has affected the product range and prices across German supermarket chains.Prices for basic products such as pasta and sunflower oil, for instance, have soared by 40% and 100% respectively. Detergents, mineral water, dairy products, coffee, and toilet paper are also more expensive. Popular supermarket chain Aldi raised prices on 140 different items last week, and other supermarkets are likely to follow suit, according to Focus.However, the publication has come up with a number of measures to help consumers save money. To start with, readers are advised to drink tap water instead of buying bottled water. The publication even lists a number of firms producing water filtration systems in Germany which could help improve the taste of tap water.It also says shoppers should buy seasonal fruits and vegetables because they are always much cheaper due to the low costs regarding logistics.Additionally, the publication recommends that customers choose local and unadvertised brands instead of popular ones. Almost every supermarket chain has its own line of cheaper products. As they are always backed by larger producers, the products are almost the same or just slightly different, but the prices can be up to 60% lower.Finally, the magazine says readers should keep close track of sales and discounts, and stock up on large packs of products which have a long shelf life.On average, consumer prices were 5.5% higher in Germany last month than in February 2021, figures from the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) show. And analysts say things will only get worse if the situation in Ukraine is not resolved. According to the German Economic Institute, the crisis itself, as well as related Western sanctions and Moscow’s counter-sanctions, could drive inflation as high as 6.1% in the coming months.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

Cavusoglu has given the indication that Russian nationals will not face additional impediments to commercial ventures in Turkey. Turkey, a member of NATO, has declined to sanction Russian citizens or close its airspace to Russian aircraft. Referring to the “Russia-Ukraine crisis” after this week’s NATO leaders' summit in Brussels, Turkish President Recep Erdogan said, “Turkey's main aim is to reconcile the parties.” The country has taken a considerably less antagonistic position to the ongoing Russian special military operation aimed at denazifying and demilitarizing Ukraine than most of its European neighbors and is publicly considering implementing a Ruble-Lira exchange for the countries’ tourism sectors. The Turkish government previously announced it was closing off access to the Black Sea to warships in response to petitions by western nations to invoke a 1936 international agreement that lets “Ankara manage war traffic entering the two sea lanes during times of conflict,” but it only did so after a lengthy delay. It’s unclear whether the action has had any significant impact on the balance of forces in Ukraine. Turkey has also sold a number of Bayraktar TB2 drones to the Ukrainian regime. Turkey is just one of a number of increasingly independent countries drawing the ire of the US and leading European powers for their apparent failure to express sufficient animosity towards Russia. Hungary, another NATO nation and a member of the European Union, has also declined to participate in the Western campaign to alienate Russia. They have been similarly straightforward about the need to prioritize the development of their own economy over getting involved in foreign conflicts. The comments seemed to come in a response to a surprisingly disrespectful video address Friday in which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky openly demanded the Prime Minister “decide for yourself who you are with,” and addressed Orban by his first name: “Listen, Viktor, do you know what’s going on in Mariupol?” The coastal city of Mariupol has been under the control of the Ukrainian National Guard’s neo nazi Azov Batalion, but reports indicate Russian forces have made serious advances recently. Survivors who’ve managed to escape have accused the Azov soldiers—many of whom are open admirers of Adolf Hitler—of numerous potential war crimes, including refusing to allow the civilian population to evacuate via humanitarian corridors organized by Russia. And according to a widely-shared article in independent outlet The Grayzone, “testimony by evacuated Mariupol residents and warnings of a false flag attack undermine the Ukrainian government’s claims about a Russian bombing of a local theater sheltering civilians.” "

The comment comes after President Joe Biden said on Thursday that a Russian deployment of such substances in Ukraine would trigger “a response in kind.”Biden’s statement led to speculation that the US would intervene militarily in Ukraine if Russia used chemical weapons, whether by conventional means or by using chemical weapons of its own. Biden, who has thus far ruled out direct American involvement in the ongoing conflict, added that “the nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.”Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Sullivan said on Friday that Biden’s use of the phrase “response in kind” was referring to proportionality, and that “there will be a severe price if Russia uses chemical weapons.”Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg have all warned Russia that such a move would be met with a harsh response, though none have laid out what that it would be. Washington and its allies have accused Moscow of preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine, but Russia has rejected the accusations, and countered that Kiev might be planning a “false flag” attack to pin the blame on Russia in order to draw in NATO intervention.Meanwhile, Russia has published documents that it says show the US was funding biological weapons research in several Ukrainian laboratories. American officials have described Moscow’s claims as “disinformation,” although they have confirmed the labs’ existence, and the US government has admitted to working with Ukraine to “consolidate and secure pathogens and toxins of security concern.”Russia sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two Donbass republics by force."

London's own state-controlled BBC has covered all conflicts involving the UK in living memory, including the illegal 2003 invasion of Iraq. RT said in a statement that the move proved that the regulator is not an independent body and instead follows the political goals of the UK government.London has made it clear that the intention of the new sanctions is to prevent British citizens from hearing Russian views about the events in Ukraine. They will “prevent companies and individuals operating in the UK from doing business with Russian state propaganda vehicles RT and Sputnik” and ensure that they “will not be able to find [their] way back on UK televisions,” it said in a statement. Sputnik is a radio station, and news agency.  A total of 14 new sanctions were imposed. They also singled out General Mikhail Mizintsev, a senior Russian military planner who the statement called “the butcher of Mariupol,” after the Ukrainian port city which has seen some of the most intense fighting in the ongoing conflict.In addition to a travel ban, the sanctions block any assets held in the UK by the designated persons and entities and ban UK citizens from providing them with ""funds or economic resources,"" according to the Foreign Office.The UK has been one of the most vocal supporters of Kiev in its eight-year stand off with Russia, arming and training Ukrainian troops and pressuring non-Western nations to join the US-led effort to punish Moscow. Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

The two countries are major exporters of potash, critical for the global agriculture industry, which is already reeling from pandemic-related disruptions.Last week, fertilizer prices surged nearly 10% versus the previous week, according to Green Markets North America Fertilizer Price Index, the highest price point ever recorded. The index shows current prices are 40% higher than a month ago, before Russia’s military operation in Ukraine began.According to CRU, a UK-based commodity consultancy, prices for raw materials that make up the crop nutrient commodity market, such as ammonia, nitrogen, potash, urea, phosphates, sulphates and nitrates, saw a 30% surge since the beginning of the year, topping the levels reached during the 2008 financial crisis.Russia and Belarus are major exporters of several critical fertilizing compounds, including urea and potash.Nola urea is trading at a 34-year high of $880 per US ton compared to $182 recorded in 2020. Prices are up 60% since the West imposed sanctions against the two countries.Spiking prices for fertilizers have also been exacerbated by higher costs for natural gas, a vital feedstock in producing nitrogen-based fertilizer. Energy prices have been soaring amid EU plans to cut reliance on Russian oil and gas supplies and bans imposed by the US and a couple of other countries.The situation is also being aggravated by China’s ban on fertilizer exports, primarily nitrogen and phosphate. The measure, which expires in June, was implemented to limit the rise in domestic food prices.Moreover, a labor dispute at Canadian Pacific Railways is expected to worsen shortages, putting additional pressure on the global logistic chains. Canada’s Nutrien, the world’s biggest fertilizer producer, said it could weather a freight shutdown lasting a few days but a longer shutdown would force it to consider slowing potash production.The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization previously warned that “acute food insecurity” was plaguing dozens of countries spanning Latin America, central Africa, the Middle East, and central Asia due to conflict and erratic environmental conditions.“Ukraine has only compounded a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe,” David M. Beasley, executive director of the UN World Food Program, told The New York Times earlier this week, adding that the current levels of food insecurity have not been seen since World War II.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

As a result of a storm in the Black Sea and due to unsatisfactory technical condition, cables with bottom anchors broke at about 10 Ukrainian mines. On 24 February, Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian provocations.

More than half of respondents queried by the French Institute of Public Opinion (IFOP) agreed with at least one Russian “hypothesis” of why its attack against Ukraine was justified, the polling firm said in a report.The most agreed-with argument was that the US and the EU had “encouraged Ukraine to request integration with NATO” to gain leverage in its standoff with Russia. A total of 30% of people polled said this was true, with 29% calling it false.The argument that the persecution of Russian-speaking Ukrainians by their government had validated Moscow’s military action was accepted by 28% of people and rejected by 31%. The statement that discrimination has been ongoing for years in some parts of the country was backed by 23%, with 32% rejecting it.Russia’s claim that its national security had to be protected by all means due to NATO’s drive to integrate Ukraine was deemed true by 22% of respondents, while 42% thought it false.The statement that Ukraine has been ruled by a “junta infiltrated by neo-Nazi movements” sounded truthful to 10% of the people polled. A majority of 53% rejected it.IFOP remarked that the results demonstrated that “French people [were] far from being impervious to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s narrative,” about the Ukraine attack. Euractiv, an outlet specializing in covering EU politics, went further and labeled the five hypotheses as Russian “conspiracy narratives,” without explaining to readers what these actually were.EU member-states escalated their opposition to Russian messaging since the start of hostilities in Ukraine, including by banning news outlets RT and Sputnik in their jurisdictions. When asked by IFOP whether they approved the decision to ban, 34% of French people said they did not.CEO of IFOP Helen Lee Bouygues remarked that one could only “deplore the speed with which Russian propaganda has spread … since the start of the war in Ukraine.” She blamed social media and encrypted messaging apps, in particular Telegram, for the lack of public consent to their government’s preferred narrative on Ukraine."

She was allegedly spooked by a looming economic catastrophe, but was asked to remain in her post by the president.Bloomberg admitted Nabiullina’s “current views couldn’t be learned,” adding that for her to leave now would be seen as a “betrayal” after nearly 20 years of working with Putin. She has not said anything publicly about her position, her appointment to another five-year term on Friday, or her opinion on the conflict, and has given no outward indication that she planned on leaving.Nabiullina has urged the central bank’s staff to avoid politics, releasing a short video to colleagues earlier this month asking them to avoid “political debates” which “only burn our energy, which we need to do our jobs.” After the invasion and the multiple rounds of sanctions that followed, Nabiullina more than doubled the key interest rate and imposed capital controls to stop the flow of money out of Russia.Bloomberg praised Nabiullina’s skills, crediting her with bringing inflation under control and amassing “one of the world’s biggest stockpiles of foreign currency and gold” – much of the latter has been impounded by the US-led West. She is also credited with fighting the same capital controls she recently imposed in Russia. These allow non-Russians to buy up Russian assets – such as oil and gas stocks whose value has plummeted in the wake of sanctions – and vice versa, permitting Russians to accumulate money in foreign markets."

Soon after, infamous Russian pranksters Vovan and Lexus released clips of their conversation with Wallace.","Vovan and Lexus have released a full, 16-minute video of their conversation with UK Secretary of Defence Wallace, and the clip, in which they pretended to be the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmygal, contains new quips not seen in previously released teasers. A video of the call was originally posted on the pranksters' official YouTube channel, which was blocked by the platform on Saturday. UK Ready to Discuss ‘Security Alliance’ Asked to comment on the prospects of a military alliance between Britain and Ukraine, Wallace said that the UK was “very keen to support you in any negotiations.” “I know, my understanding is that President Zelensky is quite keen to see the United Kingdom alongside Ukraine in these negotiations because of the experience that we (well we didn’t have), but the bad experience of the Minsk Agreement, where just France and Germany were there and I think there is a desire for the UK and the US. And I think all of those subjects, including a security alliance, I think, is something to discuss with you on those negotiations,” the official said. Signed in February of 2015, the Minsk agreements saw the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France gather in the Belarusian capital to hammer out a peace treaty – including a ceasefire deal and a peace plan aimed at putting an end to the conflict in the Donbass by reintegrating the region into Ukraine in exchange for constitutionally-guaranteed autonomy. In the seven years since the agreement was signed, successive Ukrainian governments failed to make necessary reforms, notwithstanding pressure from both Russia and Europe (but, crucially – not the Washington establishment) to do so. Ukraine Will Go It Alone Asked to comment on the Kremlin's negotiating position in the Ukraine crisis, including the requirement of “iron-clad” guarantees that Ukraine will not join NATO, Wallace said that “the freedom to choose is a very important freedom for Ukraine. Russia’s other demands of Crimea and Donbass, to abandon all those, which I don’t think Ukraine will, but if Russia was to be successful, the question is, you know, Russia is still a war criminal, with sanctions around its neck and deserves to keep them there,” he said. “When it comes to discussions about security guarantees, I think we need to support you in what is the other parts of the agreement as well, you know, what are other parts of the agreement that Russia will demand and whether you think they are appropriate or whether they are acceptable. Because I don’t think Russia should be able to demand anything other than going home,” Wallace added. No-Fly Zone &amp; British Warships in the Black Sea Asked to comment on Ukraine’s repeated requests that NATO set up a no-fly zone over Ukraine, Wallace ably deflected the direction of the inquiry to discuss Britain’s arms deliveries. “I’ve just been looking at our new anti-aircraft missile that we’re sending you which is better than Stinger, it’ll work at night. It’s a very, very fast missiles and it will help close the skies to Russian aircraft,” he said. Wallace also suggested that a no-fly zone would be a two-way street, preventing Ukraine’s own aircraft and Turkish-sourced drones from operating and attacking Russian ground forces. Asked whether the UK might deploy its warships in the Black Sea to help Ukraine, Wallace returned: “Right now you mean, in the war?” The defence minister mentioned a 2021 UK stunt involving the sailing the HMS Defender destroyer into Russian territorial waters around Crimea. “Remember last year we took HMS Defender past Crimea and the Russians behaved illegally then. So look, I am considering more and more weapons systems to help. We will go into the Black Sea, I think we’re due to go soon. How close we go to Ukrainian waters where the Russians currently have a blockade I think we will be open to discussions about looking at that.” Asked whether the UK might join Ukraine in fighting Russia directly in the “next stage,” Wallace avoided the bait. “On the next stage, we would always be keen to be with you in Ukraine. But I mean - if a peace deal is there, we’re not going to – if you make a deal that is right for you in Ukraine and you are happy to deliver, Britain will look at all options to help you, including being in Ukraine. I have troops in Poland, I have troops in Estonia, I have troops in Lithuania. I am happy to be with you in Ukraine in, obviously subject to – if you remember we had 100 troops, an orbital training team, we’ve had that since 2015. But we could look at all sorts of options,” he noted. UK Said To Be Running Out of NLAWs for Its Own Army Asked whether the UK would be able to provide Ukraine with newer NLAW anti-tank missiles due to high failure rate of old ones, Wallace bristled, noting that Britain’s deliveries were not failing, and that the country was sending so many of the weapons to the defense of Ukraine that the British Army was running out of its own stocks. Nukes After the prankster suggested that Kiev was “interested” in exploring a nuclear weapons programme, Wallace said that Russia would “really hate that,” and called the issue one of those “bigger questions” that he would need to speak to the prime minister about. He added, however, that “the principle is, we will support Ukraine as our friend in the choices you make. Whether you want to be part of NATO or you don’t want to be part of NATO, whether you want to explore new weapons, etc. That is all a matter for you to decide and for the West to, in a sense, stand by you.” ‘I’m Not Responsible for Idiots’ Asked to comment on the testimony of a former British soldier who volunteered to fight in Ukraine but quit after less than a day citing the terrifying conditions, the lack of supplies and the demand that foreign legion fighters sign indefinite contracts, Wallace noted that the issue was no responsibility of his. “Look I’m not responsible for idiots that come and give interviews on media, I’m afraid. I can try and stop them, but there are also no doubt people who have come to help you, who are perfectly happy to stand and fight alongside you. If some idiot from Cardiff decides to give an interview. He’s probably an idiot….We’re trying to discourage people coming who, what we would call, are ‘Walter Mittys’ – people who are thrill seekers who haven’t really been in the army, are probably failures, rather, than the army, but we’ll see what we can do,” Wallace observed. ‘Doctored Clip’ Commenting on a trailer of the prank call that was released Tuesday, a UK Defence Ministry source called it “doctored.” Wallace spoke to The Telegraph last week to report that he had been targeted by a “Russian imposter,” and that the video call was “properly set up.” He said he really believed that he had been speaking to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denes Shmygal, and but that he eventually “got suspicious and, after about eight, nine minutes…terminated the call.” An inquiry has been set to investigate the incident, Wallace said. Soon after Wallace disclosed the prank, Home Secretary Priti Patel said she too had been a victim of the pranksters. In a comment under their YouTube video with the Wallace conversation, Vovan and Lexus promised that the “prank with Priti Patel” would be released “soon.” Vovan and Lexus, real names Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov, are Russian radio hosts who have become notorious for staging interviews with Russian and foreign public figures, ranging from celebrities like Prince Harry, Monica Lewinsky, Billie Eilish and Elton John, to political leaders including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, and others. While their interviews typically include lighthearted and silly moments, like the time they convinced EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker that Kim Kardashian wanted a job in the Armenian Foreign Ministry, they also occasionally result in insights into major diplomatic and military issues. In 2019, for example, Elliot Abrams, a Trump administration official in charge of Washington’s regime change strategy in Venezuela, told the pair that US plans did not include a direct invasion. Last year, a top Swedish diplomat revealed to the comedians that there was no unified position in Europe on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. "

The injured people “are getting all the help they need,” and the details regarding their condition will be released later.“For the safety of the residents of Zhuravlyovka and Nekhoteevka, the administration of the Belgorod district has introduced a state of emergency in these two villages,” he wrote. Responding to the incident, the chairman of the Russian Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, instructed his subordinates to “carefully investigate the circumstances of the incident, taking exhaustive measures to identify all those responsible.”Wednesday’s incident is not the first time the residents of a Russian region have been affected by the ongoing military action in Ukraine.On February 24, the day Moscow launched its offensive in the neighboring country, seven houses and one car were damaged in the Belgorod region during explosions, which, according to the Investigative Committee, were the result “of the shelling of the Belgorod region’s territory by the military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.”Three people, including one child, suffered injuries which prompted the committee to initiate a criminal case “on the fact of the attempted murder of two or more people.”Three days later, two shells, which, according to Russian investigators, were fired by Ukrainian security forces, fell in an open area in the village of Nekhoteevka, with no injuries or damage reported. Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid. Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two Donbass republics by force."

In response to Russia's special military operation to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine, which the West keeps portraying as “invasion”, NATO doubled its battlegroups on the alliance's eastern flank. In addition to existing battlegroups in the Baltic States and Poland, multinational NATO forces will be stationed in  Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. According to Støre, though, Norway will not reconsider its time-tested policy on military bases on the country's territory. Norway's landmark declaration on military bases from 1949 stipulates that the Nordic country shall never receive bases for foreign military forces on its territory in peacetime. In addition, Norway claims to have refrained from holding Allied exercises near the Russian border. “I believe that the principles we have had for Allied exercises have served Norway, our neighbourhood, and NATO well,” Støre said. This spring, the Norwegian parliament will decide on a new defence agreement with the United States. The agreement was entered into by the previous Solberg government in the spring of 2021, but will be presented for approval this spring. It may give the Americans the right to set up infrastructure at several Norwegian military bases, including Rygge, Sola, Evenes and Ramsund. Russia reacted strongly to the agreement, arguing it constituted a militarisation of Norway. Previously, Norway received forces from the US Marine Corps on a rotary basis. The Værnes Air Station also serves as a storage base for the US Armed Forces as part of the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program-Norway. Despite criticism from the opposition parties, the government has stated that the agreement is not in conflict with Norwegian policy on military bases. Overall, Norwegian-Russian relations, which date back hundreds of years to the Viking Age, have over the recent decade years become increasingly fraught due to reciprocal military build-ups in the north, numerous military jet interceptions, spying accusations, and an overall harsher rhetoric that puts a strain on decades-long partnership.

Over half of the group agreed with the idea of sending military jets to the Ukrainian Army, and 30% thought Canada should dispatch its own military forces to Ukraine.Furthermore, 82% of vaccinated respondents felt that Canada should impose tougher sanctions on Russia even if it means they would have to suffer higher prices and slower economic growth at home.On the other hand, respondents who said they were unvaccinated seem to have differing opinions, with the majority (52%) saying they don’t support any of the anti-Russian measures mentioned by the pollsters, and 75% saying they refuse to pay the price by having prices at home skyrocket.The poll also revealed how the two groups feel about the reasons for the conflict, with 88% of vaccinated respondents saying the repression of Russian speakers in the Donbass region does not justify Russia’s actions in Ukraine. The unvaccinated, however, are more split on the question, with 26% saying Russia’s military operation is justified, 27% saying it isn’t, and 35% saying they neither agree nor disagree with it.The vaccinated also say, almost unanimously (88%), that Russia is guilty of war crimes in Ukraine, while only 32% of unvaxxed respondents agree, and 42% say they don’t believe it is happening at all.These results were collected using our unique random probability panel @probitinc#cdnpolihttps://t.co/CzX8FsZT9QEKOS President Frank Graves said he found the poll results alarming, suggesting that vaccine refusers were “much more sympathetic to Russia,” and that it showcased the “highly corrosive influences of disinformation.”“This is definitely a new and bluntly insidious force that’s contributing to polarization and disinformation and poor decision-making. And it doesn’t seem to be going away. Things are getting worse,” Graves said, as reported by the Toronto Star.“I don’t think this is because those people had an ingrained sympathy to the Russians. They’re reading this online, they’re consuming this from the same sources that were giving them the anti-vax stuff.”Meanwhile, others have interpreted the poll results as a prime example of how quickly mainstream media narratives can change and how easily the masses transfer zealous support from one topic to another according to the crisis of the day."

Only 16% of respondents said they “strongly approve” of the president, compared with 42% who “strongly disapprove.”The March survey marks a new all-time low in NBC’s polling about Biden. His ratings were around 60% shortly after he took office in January 2021. The US president apparently hasn’t won over many voters so far with his handling of the crisis in Ukraine. Just 12% of Americans have “a great deal” of confidence in his ability to manage the situation, the poll showed, compared with 44% who have “very little” confidence. A further 27% said they had “just some” confidence, while 16% reported “quite a bit” of confidence.Around 36% of respondents said they’re concerned that the US will get too involved in the conflict, while 21% said their government won’t get as involved as it should. A startling 57% of Americans believe the country is already at war with Russia or will be at war with Russia within the next year.Biden has apparently failed in his efforts to convince voters that Russian President Vladimir Putin is to blame for the highest US inflation rate in 40 years. The poll found that 38% of Americans believe Biden and his policies are most to blame for surging prices. Other perceived culprits include the Covid-19 pandemic (28%) and corporations (23%). Just 6% said the Russian attack on Ukraine was the biggest cause of the inflation crisis.Just 33% of Americans approve of how Biden is handling the economy, down from 47% last August, the poll showed. Only 6% said their incomes are rising faster than the cost of living, versus 62% who said their families are falling behind economically. About 71% see the country as being on the “wrong track,” while 22% said it’s “headed in the right direction” – unchanged from January’s result.The NBC poll showed that 83% of Americans are concerned that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will make inflation even worse, including 56% who are “very concerned.” Other concerns include fears that the conflict will involve nuclear weapons (82%) and that Biden’s administration will send US troops to fight in Ukraine (74%)."

We wouldn't want that to happen.""We do not believe that we have done something that can be discussed on this issue. We hope and believe in the best.""Sorokin's words carry echoes of the views of national team boss Valeri Karpin, who said on Monday that he hoped his side would be able to resume their bid to reach the finals.International managerial newcomer Karpin had guided his side to the playoffs, in which they had been scheduled to host Poland in the semifinals on March 24.Poland were given a bye because of Russia's suspension and will now be at home to Sweden on Tuesday in a decider that will seal qualification for one of the nations.Both countries had publicly declared a boycott on playing Russia because of the conflict.Russia last week made a surprise formal declaration of interest in hosting the UEFA European Championship in either 2028 or 2032.Sokorin previously told Match TV that there were ""no signs"" of the RFU losing its membership.

First reported by the New York Post and revealing incriminating text messages, photos, and financial documents that exposed alleged corruption by the former vice president's son and apparent involvement of Joe Biden in Hunter's business deals, the bombshell story was dismissed by outlets such as The New York Times and The Washington Post as unproven “misinformation” at the time. Social media outlets such as Twitter and *Facebook echoed this stance, similarly censoring reports on the story. However, now, after The New York Times finally admitted on 16 March that emails recovered from Hunter Biden's abandoned ""laptop from hell"" had been ""authenticated"", the podcast star said on the Saturday edition of The Joe Rogan Experience: The presenter went on to slam the liberal media for fabricating a “narrative” around the laptop story while deliberately “ignoring facts”. Rogan also levelled a barrage of criticism at Hunter Biden’s father, US President Joe Biden, who repeatedly dismissed reports regarding the laptop as untrue throughout his presidential campaign, when he was running against Donald Trump. The POTUS was similarly accused of lying over the  laptop story and dismissing it as “Russian disinformation” by former Attorney General Bill Barr. “And I was shocked by that”, added Barr, who served under former President Donald Trump. Barr, who has been promoting his book One Damn Thing After Another, added: As to whether Joe Biden might face legal problems over the contents of the laptop, Barr acknowledged that the narrative could be “politically problematic”. “From a political standpoint now that this is in people's consciousness, it had been suppressed up until now, obviously they have a hot potato and just to see how they handle it will be interesting”, added Barr. On 18 March, Fox News underscored that the NYT's Hunter Biden story was being ignored by the established US media, such as CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and NBC. ""It was once routine that damning reports about the president published by The New York Times would lead nearly every news programme… That is no longer the case, at least under President Biden… Since Wednesday evening, the Times' report has received zero attention on the five major networks"". Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, found himself in the crosshairs in October 2020 after The New York Post first reported on the contents of a hard drive copied from a laptop that the US President's son purportedly left at a Delaware repair shop in 2019. The younger Biden faced scrutiny after information discovered on the Mac, dubbed “the laptop from Hell”, shed light on his numerous and sometimes controversial business dealings, such as securing a spot in the Ukrainian gas company Burisma following the 2014 coup supported by the then Obama-Biden administration, and a dubious deal with a Chinese business tycoon with suspected ties to the Communist Party. Thus, in a May 2014 email, Burisma board adviser Vadym Pozharskyi ostensibly asked Joe Biden's son to ""use [his] influence"" to politically support the Ukrainian company. In another email, dated April 2015, Pozharskyi thanked the younger Biden for arranging a meeting with his father, then-US Vice President Joe Biden. The laptop was one of three that had purportedly been owned by Hunter Biden, but had fallen out of his possession. They all contained sensitive information, including emails revealing how Joe Biden's son leveraged his US government connections and, in many cases, incriminating photographs, videos, and communications sent by Hunter. The second laptop was seized by federal agents shortly after reports first surfaced regarding the contents of the first MacBook Pro. Contents leaked by the Daily Mail from a third laptop, still missing, revealed footage of a naked Hunter Biden seemingly doing drugs with a prostitute in a Las Vegas hotel room. The current POTUS has repeatedly insisted that he never had anything to do with his son's business dealings, while dismissing allegations against Hunter Biden as ""smears from [former US President] Donald Trump's henchmen"". In its report on 16 March about the ongoing federal probe into Hunter Biden's unpaid tax bills, the NYT said that when looking into the younger Biden's business dealings, certain emails had been examined by prosecutors. The outlet also noted that those emails were obtained by them from ""a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr Biden in a Delaware repair shop"". According to the newspaper, ""the email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation"". Previously, the NYT had claimed the New York Post story on the Hunter Biden laptop was unsubstantiated. After the U-turn by the outlet, several Republicans have called to hold US mainstream media and Big Tech companies accountable for hushing the story in 2020. House lawmaker Claudia Tenney (R-NY) called for an investigation into their actions, should the GOP take back Congress in the November 2022 midterms. *Facebook is an extremist organisation banned in Russia.

Both Russia and Ukraine have been under the “Level 4 – Do Not Travel” US advisory for over a year, on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. In his introductory remarks, Price did not elaborate on “reports” that led the US government to announce the change. The only American known to have been detained by Russian authorities in recent weeks is the WNBA basketball star Brittney Griner. Griner was arrested on February 17 – a week prior to the escalation of hostilities in Ukraine – at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport, for possession of illegal narcotics. A drug-sniffing dog alerted to her luggage and police found carrying cannabis oil cartridges for a vaporizer inhaler, according to the Russian police. Griner has been charged with drug smuggling, and a court ordered her held in jail until May 19."

Moscow warned the brands about their liabilities to clients and partners in Russia and cautioned that re-entering the Russian market might prove difficult.","Several international agriculture giants, such as Cargill, Bayer and Archer Daniels Midland have faced pressure to leave the Russian market and stop supplying it with crop seeds, pesticides and other goods over the special military operation in Ukraine, but have refused to do so, The Wall Street Journal has reported. The companies cited potential humanitarian consequences for their departure from Russia – one of the biggest wheat exporters in the world, alongside Ukraine. While Russia will likely be able to sustain itself, the rest of the world might not, if agriculture giants withdraw from the country, WSJ reported, citing a managing director of the SovEcon research firm, Andrey Sizov. Wheat prices have already risen 30% since the start of the Kremlin's special military operation in Ukraine amid fears of disruptions of shipments, especially from Ukraine, as the nation's Black Sea coastline is currently blockaded by the Russian navy. If the world loses a major exporter, Russia, due to the exit of the agriculture companies, it could face serious food shortages, the magazine warned. Several American and Ukrainian organisations have called on major international companies to stop supplying goods to Russia, while some companies have declined. Cargill, pointing at potential consequences for global food-security, did, however, promise to scale back investment and some of what they characterized as non-critical operations in Russia, the WSJ said. Syngenta, a major producer of pesticide and seeds, also cited fears of potential food shortages as justification to continue its work in the Russian market, WSJ reported, citing anonymous sources. Several other companies, like ADM, Bunge, Viterra and Glencore said they would limit development of business in the country, but would not stop the practice. Germany's Bayer promised to withhold crop seed supplies to Russia in 2023 but only if the military conflict in Ukraine continues. Earlier, several pharmaceutical and consumer product companies, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson and AmerisourceBergen, said they would stop shipping non-essential goods to Russia, but would continue to deliver drugs for medical patients, citing humanitarian concerns and the essential nature of access to medicine.

Slovakia, which is part of both NATO and the EU, has a population of 5.5 million and shares a 100km-long (62-mile-long) border with Ukraine.“The system will be temporarily deployed at the Sliac air force base. Further deployment areas are being considered ... so the security umbrella covers the largest-possible part of Slovak territory,” Nad wrote in a Facebook post.The Patriot system was provided to Bratislava by fellow NATO members Germany and the Netherlands, and will be serviced by the troops from those countries. The bloc’s battle group in Slovakia is expected to number 2,100.The minister said the Patriot would not replace Slovakia’s Soviet-era S-300, but rather serve as an additional element of the country’s air defenses. However, he reiterated Bratislava’s willingness to deploy another system because of the S-300’s “age, technical condition, [and] insufficient capabilities” and because the Ukrainian conflict has made military cooperation with Russia “unacceptable.”Last week, Nad said Slovakia was ready to answer Ukraine’s call and hand over its S-300 system to Kiev, but only if it was supplied with a proper substitute. Moscow has warned the West against sending advanced air defense systems to Ukraine, saying the shipments would be targeted and destroyed.Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine late last month, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia's eventual recognition of the breakaway Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."

McEldowney, who worked for Harris since she took office alongside President Joe Biden, will be replaced by her deputy Philip Gordon, the White House said Monday. Earlier, a Reuters report, citing an internal memo, claimed McEldowney referred to the need to “focus on some pressing personal matters”. There is no clarity yet as to when the resignation will take effect, with the former ambassador to Bulgaria and one-time director of the State Department’s Foreign Service Institute cited as saying she wasn’t “rushing out the door”. McEldowney is said to have advised President Joe Biden and VP Kamala Harris on a range of global issues, including the speedy withdrawal from Afghanistan, negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme, and the ongoing special operation launched by Russia to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine. In a statement, Harris was cited as praising McEldowney for her “invaluable counsel” and “exceptional talent, deep expertise, and leadership navigating complex challenges”. Nancy McEldowney, who accompanied Kamala Harris on her recent official visits to Central America, Asia, and Europe, is the 10th key VP staffer to depart since last June amid reports of bullying and a “toxic” work environment. Others to quit have been Director of Digital Strategies Rajun Kaur, Director of Advance Karly Satkowiak, Deputy Director of Advance Gabrielle DeFranceschi, Communications Director Ashley Etienne, Chief Spokesperson Symone Sanders, Director of Press Operations Peter Velz, Deputy Director of Public Engagement Vince Evans, Speechwriting Director Kate Childs Graham, and Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh. While White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki defended the departures late last year as “natural”, Symone Sanders and Ashley Etienne both quit the VP’s team amid what reports in December called “entrenched dysfunction and lack of focus”. Kamala Harris' staff was ""experiencing low morale, porous lines of communication and diminished trust among aides and senior officials"", Politico had reported in July 2021. According to former Harris aide Gil Duran, cited by The Washington Post, the VP adhered to an allegedly “soul-destroying” management style. "

Gaetz however refused to accept Vorndran's claim of ignorance and pressed the issue on him.

He broached the issue at a Sunday rally where he sought to draw on supporters’ energy as his political opposition has attempted to oust him and reminded his supporters during Thursday’s broadcast that Pakistan had gotten nothing from supporting the US’ war on “terror” except a lot more terrorists and drone bombings.Khan has refused to bow to American pressure and condemn Russia for sending troops into Ukraine, arguing Pakistan had nothing to gain by such a move. However, this has made him a target for the US and its allies, who are already upset that neighboring India has also refused to join their sanctions campaign against Moscow.Debate regarding the no-confidence motion was supposed to begin on Thursday, though the deputy speaker, a member of Khan’s party, suspended the proceedings when the legislators chose not to address other items on the agenda first. This scandalized opposition leader Shahbaz Sharif, who told reporters that the deputy speaker had “once again dishonored the parliamentary norms by not allowing the agenda item for a debate.”Parliament is next due to meet on Sunday. Khan’s party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, is not just outnumbered – it’s fighting the two more mainstream parties (Pakistan Muslim League-N and Pakistan People’s Party) that typically switch off power between them. On top of that, he faces even steeper odds, as surviving the no-confidence measure would bring him one step closer to becoming the only Pakistani PM to ever complete his term. The embattled PM – who previously played cricket for the country’s team, leading them to their only World Cup victory in 1992 – has refused to resign, no matter what the odds against him, declaring he will “never quit whatever the result may be.”"

While refusing in private to accept the country, the alliance has maintained a public illusion of a potential accession, he claimed.The ongoing conflict with Russia could have been prevented if NATO accepted Ukraine in time, Zelensky has also said.“If we were a NATO member, a war wouldn't have started. I'd like to receive security guarantees for my country, for my people,” Zelensky told CNN, reiterating his calls on the US-led alliance to take his country in.“If NATO members are ready to see us in the alliance, then do it immediately, because people are dying on a daily basis… If you want to see us in this dubious position where we don't understand whether you can accept us or not – you cannot place us in this situation, you cannot force us to be in this limbo.”While the alliance has publicly recognized Ukraine as its “special partner,” its stance in private has been quite different, Zelensky revealed.I requested them personally to say directly that we are going to accept you into NATO in a year or two or five, just say it directly and clearly, or just say no. And the response was very clear, you're not going to be a NATO member, but publicly, the doors will remain open.Top Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky himself, have repeatedly reiterated the country’s NATO aspirations. The ambitions even got incorporated into Ukraine’s constitution in 2019 under then-President Petro Poroshenko. NATO itself appeared to have been welcoming towards such aspirations, formally recognizing them in the 2008 Bucharest Summit Declaration, when the bloc’s members agreed the country would eventually become a member.The eastward expansion of the bloc, and Ukraine’s proclaimed resolve to join it in particular, have been among the top security concerns repeatedly voiced by Russia. NATO, however, has effectively rejected discussing these issues, maintaining that no third party, and especially not Moscow, should have any say regarding anyone’s aspiration to join the alliance.Moscow attacked the neighboring state last month following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to regularize the status of the breakaway regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO.

If I hadn’t left in January and had started preparing there, everything would have been different.“What worries me the most is the explosions from (missiles) in Donetsk and Makeyevka, the number of victims... This mood has persisted for eight years, so I can’t say that something is happening now new to me,” he added.Despite Krylov's desire to refrain from making his views public, the military operation in Ukraine has had an impact on Saturday's fight card in London.The event's headliner, Moscow native Alexander Volkov, has been cleared to fight despite concerns that his previously-issued visa would be revoked amid an apparent crackdown on Russian athletes and sports teams - with the UFC even drafting in a heavyweight fighter to be on stand-by to face hometown fighter Tom Aspinall should the UK government rescind Volkov's visa.And while Krylov was unaffected, it wasn't the same for some members of his corner team.“It became a big problem for some of my cornermen,” Krylov explained of the travel uncertainty.""I was asked by the UFC to arrive as early as possible. As soon as my visa was issued, I immediately flew out, on March 1 I was already here. Because of this, the preparation plan got a little off, because I was supposed to have another week of training in Tver [in Russia].“But, in principle, here we were able to make up for all this. Although, for example, Alexander Volkov arrived on March 12, and everything is fine with him. We can say that we rushed a bit... but now everything is alright.”But now that he stands on the eve of his 15th fight in the UFC (and his first since last February's defeat to Magomed Ankalaev), Krylov says that he doesn't expect ring-rust to be an issue once the first bell rings. “There are no fears about the break in activity,” he said. “Of course, I’m used to fighting more often. But in 2020, coronavirus restrictions played a role, I was preparing for the fight with Magomed Ankalaev with an injury. An operation, an old injury surfaced, another operation.“Now I'm more than ready.”"

He was commenting on the outcome of peace talks in Turkey. Kiev’s proposals for a settlement apparently include a pledge to resolve the territorial dispute over the peninsula within 15 years without the use of force.“Crimea is part of the Russian Federation. According to our constitution, we cannot discuss with anyone the fates of Russian territories, the fates of Russian regions. That is out of the question,” the official said.Crimea voted to rejoin Russia in 2014, in a disputed referendum, after a violent Western-backed coup in Kiev overthrew the Ukrainian government. Kiev claims the vote was illegitimate and now refers to Crimea as temporarily occupied Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian officials have said that under no circumstances will they drop the claim over the region.Crimea was part of Russia until 1954, when the Soviet government transferred it to Kiev's control, while both countries were part of a union state. During the peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, the Ukrainian delegation delivered to Russia a written proposal for how the armed conflict between the two nations could be resolved. According to Moscow, Ukraine said it was ready to pledge to remain a neutral nation and not to host foreign troops on its soil. Kiev said that in exchange, it wants NATO-like security guarantees from leading world powers, including Russia.Russia’s top negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said that Ukraine is seeking to include “parts” of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions in the definition of its territory for the purpose of security guarantees, and stressed that Ukraine’s proposals will not necessarily be part of the final document. Moscow recognized the Donbass republics as independent states in February.Peskov said Russia’s top negotiator is due to make additional public statements later in the day about the progress made, which the Russian government considers promising, but still modest. "

Joly has not commented publicly on the incident. The author told RT that he is against Russia’s offensive. “But Canada was more aggressive in pushing NATO expansion in Eastern Europe in the 1990s even than the US government was,” he added. “Even amidst the growing tensions in January, Minister Joly doubled down, saying ‘yes, we think Ukraine should still be part of NATO.’”The Canadian government has taken all kinds of very belligerent positions that have really exacerbated the tragedy we’re seeing [in Ukraine].Russia has consistently said that it viewed NATO’s eastward expansion as a threat. President Vladimir Putin listed Kiev’s aspirations to join the US-led military bloc as one of the reasons Moscow attacked the neighboring country on February 24.Last fall, Moscow demanded that the US and NATO provide legally binding assurances that the bloc will not move closer to Russian borders. NATO replied that it will not drop its ‘open-door policy’, which means that anyone can apply for membership at any moment.Engler believes that, by supplying weapons to Ukraine, the West has been “fueling the conflict,” rather than helping to resolve it.“The decision-makers in Ottawa and Washington very much view Ukraine as a proxy against Russia. They would like to see something equivalent to what happened in Afghanistan during the 1980s,” the author said. “What that would mean effectively is Canada, the US and others pumping in endless amounts of weapons until the last Ukrainian was willing to fight and die.”NATO wants to “control security arrangements in Europe,” and is partly motivated by arms sales, Engler believes. He added that Canada has been “completely integrated” into Washington’s weapons exports thanks to defense production sharing deals.Canada’s military aid to Kiev includes portable anti-tank systems, rocket launchers, hand grenades and ammunition, as well as body armor, night vision gear and field rations for soldiers.Joly said on Monday that officials “have exhausted inventory from the Canadian Armed Forces,” and were studying “additional options” to send more weapons to Ukraine.“We need to make sure Ukrainians win this war. Vladimir Putin cannot prevail,” the minister said the next day. “This is a question that is existential to the West and the world's stability.”Moscow attacked Ukraine following a seven-year standoff over Kiev's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO.

Baru backed New Delhi’s official response of not taking sides in the row in Eastern Europe. While addressing a CEO roundtable at the White House on Monday, Biden lauded the “united response” to Russian military actions presented by NATO and the US’ partners in the Pacific region. “The Quad is — with the possible exception of India being somewhat shaky on some of this. But Japan has been extremely strong, so has Australia, in terms of dealing with Putin’s aggression.  We presented a united front throughout NATO and the Pacific”, Biden added. He underlined that New Delhi’s “primary focus on national security” was served by its “own economic development” and maintaining “peace and stability” in the neighbourhood. Moscow has been a reliably defence and strategic partner for New Delhi since the 1970s, and is a source of over 60 percent of its defence imports.  The security ties with Moscow have assumed even greater significance for New Delhi against the backdrop of its ongoing border standoff with China. In spite of enjoying close security and strategic ties with Beijing as well, Russia has continued to supply high-grade weaponry to India, most recently the S-400 surface-to-air missiles (which will reportedly be operational by April). According to reports, Indian companies are also stepping up their crude purchases from Russia, which has offered energy at cheaper prices on the back of Western sanctions against Moscow. On the other hand, India has stepped up its defence and energy procurements from the US over the last five years. India bought $3.4 billion worth of American armaments between 2016 and 2020, besides being designated as a “major defence partner” in 2018. India’s Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri noted in parliament on Monday that New Delhi had bought around $13.5 billion in energy (crude, natural gas, and coal) from the US, also stating that crude volumes from the US could “rise significantly” in coming months.  Around 7.3 percent of India’s crude requirements were sourced from the US in March 2020-April 2021, Puri said. While India is also a member of theWashington-led Quad grouping (including Japan and Australia), it has refused to enter into a formal alliance with Washington and declined to side with the West on Ukraine. Before Biden’s remarks, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki last week also asked India not to support Moscow.  Psaki, however, admitted that sourcing more Russian oil by India won’t violate the US sanctions. ""But also think about where you want to stand when history books are written at this moment in time”, the US official remarked.  Brahma Chellaney, a noted Indian strategic affairs expert, has also blasted Biden for describing India’s response as “shaky”, as he criticised the lack of a forceful response from the Democrat administration towards the Ladakh border dispute. The Indian expert recalled that, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other Trump-era officials had “no hesitation” in blasting the “Chinese aggression against India”. “But Biden hasn't said a word, and there have been only passing references by his officials to the aggression in the context of China's other actions”, he added.  Russia says that the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), which has enlisted new members in the former Soviet Union’s territory in five separate waves since 1990, is one of the primary reasons for its special military operation in Ukraine, announced on 24 February by President Vladimir Putin. Moscow has offered to put an end to its operation if Kiev enshrines a neutral status in its constitution, which is among the preconditions set by Russia. "

While there are no reports of civilian casualties, four Russian soldiers may have been injured in the strike.RIA Novosti contradicted the claim, saying the incident was caused by “human error.”Video of the explosion, followed by secondary blasts, started making rounds after dark, local time. Initial reports speculated someone at the depot mishandled munitions, but Ukrainian media soon claimed that the 19th Missile Brigade of their military had fired a Tochka-U tactical ballistic missile at the warehouse.Regional head Vyacheslav Gladkov told Russian outlets that the explosion happened in the village of Krasny Oktyabr, about 20km from the Ukrainian border. “There are no casualties among the residents, and no damage to the hamlet. Emergency services are on the scene. We’ll know the cause of the events later,” Gladkov said in a statement. Secondary explosions reportedly stopped after about half an hour.Four servicemen were injured when “a projectile hit” a military installation in the Belgorod region, according to TASS.The strike comes after Russia announced it would “drastically reduce” its military activity in northern Ukraine, on the approaches to Kiev and Chernigov, as a sign of good faith for peace talks with Kiev. Delegations from both sides met in Istanbul, Turkey earlier on Tuesday and set out their parameters for negotiations.Meanwhile, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu told reporters that the primary objective of the military operation had been achieved and that it would now focus on the “liberation of Donbass,” referring to the two breakaway regions that Moscow has recognized as independent states.Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two Donbass republics by force."

Albright was one of the key architects of NATO's 78-day bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, which was launched on March 24, 1999 - exactly 23 years ago. In December, Russia sent the Biden administration security guarantee proposals in an effort to prevent NATO’s further enlargement. However, Moscow said the US largely ignored its most critical demands including a guarantee to never allow Ukraine into NATO. Moscow, Nikovski added, was forced to undertake the special operation in Ukraine because the legitimate government was toppled with the help of the United States and others. Albright’s role in US domestic politics was positive, he added, but the world, and particularly the Balkan region, will remember her for her aggressive and ""anti-civilizational"" policies. The role Albright played in the breaking away of Kosovo from Serbia showed the world that US foreign policy is unscrupulous, Nikovski said. Years afterward, he added, Albright admitted that the bombing campaign was illegal, but also claimed it was useful. The former diplomat said Albright’s role as US Secretary of State in expanding NATO deserves wholehearted and deep condemnation given that her predecessor, James Baker, told Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand an inch eastward after the reunification of Germany. Nikovski served as Undersecretary in the Macedonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Ambassador to Russia, Albania, and the United Kingdom before resigning over criticisms of the United States for allegedly interfering in the country’s internal affairs. Albright moved from Czechoslovakia to the United States in 1948, where she would work as a professor at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service and found the Albright Institute for Global Affairs at Wellesley College in addition to her public service.

He called for others to join him in boycotting the event if Ukraine’s leader isn’t asked to speak.“If it turns out to be what is happening, I would encourage everyone involved to know that, though it may be their moment – and I understand that – to celebrate their films, it is so much more importantly their moment to shine and to protest and to boycott the Academy Awards,” Penn told CNN host Jim Acosta.ICYMI: Actor Sean Penn says the Oscars should be boycotted if the ceremony’s planners have decided against having Zelensky on the program. pic.twitter.com/4LI2YIiKcDThe star vowed to make a statement using the best-actor Oscars he won for his roles in ‘Milk’ and ‘Mystic River’ if he didn’t get his way. “If it comes to it, when I return, I’ll smelt mine in public,” Penn said. “I pray that’s not what’s happened. I pray there have not been arrogant people who consider themselves representatives of the greater good in my industry that have not decided to check in with the leadership in Ukraine. So, I’m just going to hope that’s not what’s happened, and I hope that everybody walks out if it is.”Penn went so far as to say that deciding against inviting Zelensky to speak amid Ukraine’s conflict with Russia would be “the most obscene moment in all of Hollywood history.”The 61-year-old actor arrived in Kiev last month, just before Russia launched its offensive in Ukraine, to film material for a documentary on tensions surrounding the former Soviet republic. He posted a Twitter message on February 28 regarding his harrowing evacuation from Ukraine to Poland.Penn hasn’t been nominated for any gongs at this year’s Academy Awards. He won his last Oscar in 2008, for ‘Milk’. The 2022 ceremony is scheduled to take place on Sunday evening in Los Angeles.Zelensky would presumably have to participate remotely, if he chooses to accept an invitation. He has done countless media interviews and video addresses from Kiev as he campaigns for more international support in Ukraine’s fight against Russia. Penn reportedly met with Zelensky earlier this week and attended a press conference."

And, eventually, to try setting them against the government's policy, against Russian President [Vladimir Putin's] policy, hoping that in the end it will result in some kind of trouble for the authorities, that it will create problems for the authorities,"" Medvedev said. ""However, it seems to me that the people who are generating these decisions are absolutely unaware of our mentality, they do not understand the attitude of the Russian people in the broad sense of this word. They do not understand the motivations behind this pressure, that when such pressure is exerted - and this pressure is not on large entrepreneurs, not on big businesses, it is pressure on everyone - the society consolidates,"" the deputy chairman added. He also stressed that Western attempts to restrict Russian business in order to somehow influence the country's authorities are ""senseless and foolish"" as businesspersons turned out to be ""guilty without guilt,"" and none of them is able to change the position of the Russian leadership. The former Russian president added that authorities and business have different tasks. ""Those who are engaged in the country's management primarily focus on the interests of the whole country, on the interests of the people of Russia. Whoever is in charge of running their own business (this is a very important task), is in charge of only that. Therefore, thinking that by restricting Russian business they will somehow influence the authorities... that is absolutely senseless, it is just stupid, foolish."" Medvedev noted that Western countries do not understand that Russians will ""stand up for the country, will be a guide to the policy of the country"" in this sort of situation. He added that ""such restrictions, deprivations, these only bring people together, consolidate people, not divide them. And that is their main miscalculation, this is the weakness of these foolish sanctions."" Speaking to Sputnik and RT, Medvedev pointed out that Russia's special military operation in Ukraine proceeds as planned and will continue until goals of demilitarisation and 'de-Nazification are achieved.  The deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council stressed that the operation was kicked off primarily because the goals set by Moscow were not achieved diplomatically. On 24 February, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine after the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk that had been recognised by Moscow as independent few days prior, appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian provocations. In response to  Russia’s operation, Western countries have imposed numerous packages of sanctions against Moscow, targeting Russian officials and entities, businesses, media, and financial institutions. Some foreign companies have decided to ""suspend their operations"" in Russia altogether. "

It has accumulated these over the past few years and they now make up almost half of its foreign reserves.Nonetheless, permitting yuan-dominated Russian reserves puts pressure on Beijing, the Finance Ministry noted earlier this month, adding that the West had been pressuring China to limit Russia’s access to those reserves. All of the country’s gold is kept at home, the regulator added.According to the Finance Ministry, Russia has a total of about $640 billion in reserves, of which some $300 billion has been frozen. Moscow could not have foreseen such a development, and the freeze essentially constitutes theft, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week.After its dollar and euro reserves were frozen, Russia applied what the central bank described as tit-for-tat measures. The movement of capital was restricted, and the sale of securities by foreign investors was banned, as was the withdrawal of funds from the Russian financial system, among other measures taken. Essentially, the central bank said, it prevented “unfriendly countries” from receiving funds from Russia in an amount comparable to the Russian assets that had been frozen.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

On Friday, the Daily Mail rolled out a report, citing emails from the younger Biden's infamous laptop, that appeared to back the Russian ministry's assertions, unearthing details about how Hunter Biden allegedly used his leverage as a board member of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma to pour money into research of pandemic-causing pathogens in Ukraine. One might suggest that the move by the UK media outlet indicated the readiness of Western journalists to finally look into the long-dismissed allegations around Hunter Biden. But not everyone is so optimistic. The term ""limited hangout"" is used to describe the revelation of a portion of previously hidden information, which occurs when it is impossible to stick to the initial ""cover-up"" story, so that attention is drawn to it and the rest remains clandestine. Dankof pointed out that there have been other reports in Western alternative media that covered the story ""far more comprehensively, with a fair reference to specific Russian accusations and accompanying evidence"". What the Daily Mail did, he believes, is not about that, as comprehensive reporting from mainstream media outlets would prompt questions about the very core of the Western narrative. The reason for rolling out a ""limited hangout"", he suggests, was the remarks by Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland on the US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. In her exchange with Senator Marco Rubio on the subject, Nuland confirmed the existence of biolaboratories in Ukraine, but denied the Russian accusations of the labs being used for the creation of biowarfare agents. Independent journalist and writer Daniel Lazare also does not seem to be enthusiastic about the Daily Mail report, deeming it ""interesting but [far] from conclusive"". ""The Hunter Biden angle is fascinating, but sheds no light on the nature of such research"", he says. ""It's possible that the labs were engaged in biowar research, but such suspicions are still far from proven"". But Washington's official assurances that there was no biowarfare research in Ukraine is far from being persuasive as well, Lazare notes. ""Given all that, and given America's ample record of lying when it comes to WMDs, we can safely conclude that its assurances regarding the labs cannot be taken at face value and that the US should come clean before the appropriate international authorities"", he explains. ""That means making all relevant records public and submitting to public questioning concerning all aspects of the labs and their activities"". Hunter Biden, however, was not the only one to purportedly funnel money into the alleged bioweapons research in Ukraine. Some of the money for the Ukrainian biolabs was provided by the Pentagon, raising questions regarding how US taxpayer money is being used. Dankof notes that the decision to finance the Ukrainian laboratories instead of, say, channeling the money into important social issues is ""a more important policy and budgetary issue for all of the criminals in the Biden administration"". He also slams the ""supporters of this madness in both the GOP and the Democratic Party in Congress, and a servile mainstream media in the United States owned and staffed by the elite interests involved in this and in Bush's 'War on Terror' in the Middle East"". Had the mainstream media paid enough attention to the Hunter Biden laptop story earlier, much more damning details would have emerged, Dankof believes, listing ""the criminal enterprises of Hillary Clinton just since 2016 and those of Hunter's own father"". Aside from this, he notes, the media's more thorough look inside the contents of the ""laptop from hell"" would have ""guaranteed the re-election of Donald Trump, something the American Deep State and its assets in [the] media and social media would not permit to happen"". The Biden administration does not seem to eager to address the issue, even though two-thirds of Americans, according to a recent Rassmussen poll, believe that the story about Hunter Biden's laptop is ""important"" and warrants further investigation. The reasons behind the White House's reluctance for such an investigation, Dankof says, are similar to those mentioned above. ""It would begin an unraveling of the real story on Joe and Hunter Biden; the president isn't going to honestly talk about [it] with the American public because he's a crook, as is his son and a whole host of players in the Ukrainian affair since February of 2014 that threatens to engulf all of us in World War III"", he says. Moreover, he continues, the White House appears to be prepared to attack anyone not ready to agree with the official narrative - just like Washington shielded its views on other controversial events.  Among those who have already been attacked by the Western media over their disagreement with the mainstream view, Dankof referred to Tulsi Gabbard, whom Hillary Clinton once called a ""Russian asset"". Gabbard, for her part, had branded the then-Democratic candidate ""the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party"". Since Gabbard weighed in to voice concerns about the American biolabs in Ukraine, she has yet again been labeled a ""Russian asset"" and a traitor by a handful of US lawmakers, among them GOP Senator Mitt Romney and Congressman Adam Kinzinger. In light of the findings by the Russian Defence Ministry, the Kremlin said it will demand an explanation from the United States regarding Hunter Biden's alleged involvement in the financing of biological research in Ukraine, with China also urging Washington to clarify the story around the alleged bioweapons. According to Russia, the United States has been pouring money into biological research in Ukraine aimed at potentially creating bioweapons or looking into the spread of dangerous pathogens. Aside from Hunter Biden, the Russian Defence Ministry found the US Agency for International Development (USAID), George Soros' Open Society Foundations, and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention also financed the research, which took place in 31 laboratories across 14 settlements in Ukraine. Ukraine is not the only country to have hosted the US-funded biolabs, Russia said, noting that similar research was conducted in Georgia, Indonesia, Germany, Azerbaijan and many other nations across the globe. The United States has vehemently denied the allegations, calling them part of a disinformation campaign, but Under Secretary Victoria Nuland in early March happened to confirm the existence of biolaboratories, saying that the US was ""quite concerned"" that Russian troops might take over the facilities.

He also said that there are ""liaisons that are there"", and ""they're being given advice, and that’s different"". There are currently more than 10,000 American troops stationed in Poland. Washington has repeatedly said that it does not plan to deploy troops in Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict in the Eastern European country. Wolters' comments come shortly after President Biden's remarks in Poland were interpreted by some as an indication of a potential deployment of American troops in Ukraine. On Monday, Biden attempted to clarify his statement, explaining that he meant that the Defence Department was going to train Ukrainian troops that are currently in Poland. This was not the only off-script statement by the US president. On Saturday, Biden said that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" - a remark that was also deemed by many as an indication of Washington's push for regime change in Russia. The White House was quick to walk the statement back, assuring that the United States has no strategy to change the regime in Russia. "

While the Russian military has released a trove of documents purporting to outline the weapons program, Thomas-Greenfield told the UN Security Council that Washington does not support any foreign bioweapon initiatives.The White House has instead accused Russia of planning a “false flag” attack using chemical or biological weapons, after fielding similar allegations in early February that Moscow would release a “fake video” of a Ukrainian attack in order to justify military action.The video never materialized, though Russia did send troops into Ukraine late last month on a mission to “denazify” and “demilitarize” the country. Russia demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

We are working as usual…The only limit is: we are suspending settlements with British contractors,” an Alfa-Bank representative told the Russian news outlet RBC in response to the new restrictions.“Sanctions, imposed by Great Britain, won’t affect the activities of Rosselkhozbank. The bank has no assets in Great Britain, all primary activities of RSKHB are concentrated on Russian territory”, said a representative for Rosselkhozbank.Nine Belarusian entities and individuals, including the State Authority for Military Industry, the Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant and several military-industrial enterprises were also added to the list of entities targeted by British sanctions.Britain said the purpose of the new sanctions was to “encourage Russia to cease actions destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.”"

The Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 are now listed as the Galaxy Fold 3 and Galaxy Flip 3 on the company’s official website in the Baltic countries.Samsung has not commented on the move, but some media outlets have suggested that the change is because of the Ukraine crisis as the ‘Z’ symbol has been used by Russia during its ongoing military offensive in the country.“The Korean brand is probably dropping the letter Z in solidarity with the Ukrainian people, considering the markets where the name change is in effect,” the outlet Android Headlines wrote, which was among the first to report on the company’s move. “This likely isn’t a permanent change,” it said.So far, however, the phones are still marketed with the ‘Z’ branding in the Ukrainian market.On Tuesday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba urged the global community to partially ban the letter ‘Z’, since from Kiev’s point of view, it represents “Russia’s war of aggression.”Following Kuleba’s request, Lithuanian officials proposed criminalizing the Latin letter, when used along with the St. George ribbon, a Russian symbol of victory in the Great Patriotic War (World War II). The legislators want to equate them with the Nazi swastika and punish the the display of Russian symbols with a €500 fine.Meanwhile, according to German newspaper Bild, the letter ‘Z’ as a symbol of Russia’s military operation has been banned in some regions of Germany, including Berlin, Bavaria, Lower Saxony, and North Rhine-Westphalia.The letter is commonly seen on Russian Army vehicles used in the military operation in Ukraine, which was launched on February 24. Since then, ‘Z’ has become a widespread symbol of support for Moscow’s military action against Kiev, and is often used on banners and bumper stickers.  "

On the same day, Russia's Special Representative to Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, also held meetings with the Taliban leadership and also former Afghan President Hamid Karzai.","Countries such as China and Russia are deepening their commercial ties with the Taliban* in spite of persisting reservations about the Islamist group’s policies harboured by the US and other western partners, according to Indian strategic affairs analyst and former Army officer Pravin Sawhney, talking to Sputnik. The US and its western allies have maintained that establishing normal diplomatic and trade relations with the Taliban hinge on the group's ability to fulfil its commitments, including forming an inclusive cabinet, respecting women and human rights.  Russia, China and Pakistan have supported calls for greater engagement between the Taliban and the global community. Although both Russia and China are batting for deeper economic engagement with Kabul, both the governments have yet to recognise officially the group's claim to Afghanistan's leadership. The Taliban has yet to be recognised by any foreign government. Significantly, the Taliban's recent refusal to open schools for girls in spite of earlier pledges, was supported by Pakistan, whose Prime Minister Imran Khan defended ""tribal customs"" and said that the ""idea of human rights and women’s rights is different in every society"". The US and other western nations, meanwhile, warned that the decision would ""harm"" Afghanistan's reputation and economic progress. Sahwney argues that the “western idea of democracy and human rights” has been “completely rejected by Afghanistan as well as by both Russia and China among other countries in the region. Commenting on the ongoing international processes, Sawhney points out that the Russian military operation in Ukraine and subsequent western sanctions against Moscow have implications for the global order, including Afghanistan. The analyst further points out that extending the BRI, or China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), north into Afghanistan would only reinforce the ""vision"" of a Beijing-led “Asia-Pacific architecture”. Backed by Beijing, the BRI, or One Belt One Road (OBOR) is a set of existing and proposed connectivity and infrastructure projects aimed at bringing together the economies of Asia, Africa, Europe and other regions. A study in 2019 claimed that BRI could boost the global economy by $7 trillion per year by 2040, with more than 56 countries set to benefit. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a flagship project under BRI. The CPEC begins in China’s Xinjiang province and extends to the port of Gwadar on Pakistan’s Arabian Sea coast. Pakistan’s Khan has said that CPEC is crucial for his country's economic growth. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held meetings with Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Interior Minister Siraj Haqqani during his Thursday visit to Kabul. Wang is the most senior Chinese statesman to have visited Afghanistan since the Taliban stormed to power last August. Wang expressed hope that the Taliban will keep working towards an “inclusive” government and “opposed foreign forces imposing political pressure and economic sanctions on Afghanistan at will”. The Chinese Foreign Minister has also invited Muttaqi to the foreign ministers' meeting of Afghanistan's neighbouring countries, which Beijing is set host this month. Similar security assurances were given to Wang by Haqqani, who is one of the most influential figures in the Taliban government. In his meeting with Baradar, Wang said that he “welcomes” Afghanistan’s role in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Beijing was willing to extend the connectivity project from Pakistan into Afghanistan. According to the Taliban’s foreign office spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi, Russia's special envoy Kabulov discussed “political, economic, transit and regional relations” with the Taliban leadership. He said that Kabulov expressed Russia’s willingness to sign agreements with the Taliban in a number of spheres, including industry, agriculture and energy.  The Russian special representative was accompanied by officials from the ministries of the interior, agriculture, defence and energy, according to Balkhi. Russia so far hasn't issued any statement on the visit. *Terrorist organisation outlawed in Russia and in other countries. "

Patel said the British public wasn’t worried about it.In a video call the duo – known as Vovan and Lexus – say took place on March 15, the caller impersonating Shmygal tells Patel, “I hope that the families will not be afraid from our nationalists, as Putin tried to make them fear.”Patel at first replied that “we launched the sponsorship scheme yesterday, just for people to express their interest in housing Ukrainian nationals.”“No, I mean people who are nationalists, as Putin tried to fear all the world,” the prankster clarified. “There are a lot of Banderas, neo-Nazis, I hope that UK citizens are not afraid of them.” “Clearly they are not,” Patel responded. “The support is very significant here, it really is.”The clip posted by the duo is less than a minute long and lacks any further context. The pair promised to release a longer version “in a few days on our channel.”The conversation took place a day after the British government launched the ‘Homes for Ukraine’ scheme, in which British citizens were asked to “open their homes to those fleeing the war in Ukraine.” Ukrainians with an offer of accommodation from the UK could then obtain visas to live and work in the UK for up to three years.By mentioning “Banderas” and “neo-Nazis,” the notorious pranksters were referring to followers of Nazi collaborator and terrorist Stepan Bandera, considered a hero by many on the Ukrainian right, and the prevalence of racialist ideologies in Ukrainian society.Vovan and Lexus (Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov) are well-known for their pranks, and their past targets have included celebrities such as Elton John and Prince Harry, and world leaders such as Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In another teaser clip recorded last week and posted on Tuesday, the pair spoke to British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. Again posing as Shmygal, one of the two attempted to talk Wallace into helping Ukraine develop nuclear weapons.Wallace responded that he believed “Russia would really hate it,” before adding, “the principle is: We will support Ukraine as our friend in the choices you make.” However, Wallace appeared to be speaking in terms of alliances or political support, and noted that he couldn’t comment on anything else before speaking to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Britain’s Ministry of Defense demanded that YouTube remove the video, calling it “doctored by the Russian state … to try and sap the morale” of the Ukrainians. However, as of Thursday evening it remains online. Vovan and Lexus have previously been accused of working for the Russian state, something they have repeatedly denied."

Washington claims that the S-400s pose a threat to NATO and are incompatible with the alliance's military hardware, something that Turkey rejects. ","Washington and Ankara discussed ""the unlikely possibility"" of Turkey delivering its Russian-made S-400 missile defence systems to Kiev's forces in order to help them fight Russian troops amid Moscow's ongoing special operation in Ukraine, according to Reuters. The sources added that the issue ""also came up briefly"" during US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman's visit to Turkey earlier in March. Reuters, in turn, reported that America's alleged suggestion regarding the S-400s was ""part of a wider discussion between Sherman and Turkish officials about how the United States and its allies can do more to support Ukraine and on how to improve bilateral ties"". The two's relations has been marred by the S-400 issue since Ankara and Moscow signed a contract in 2017 on the supply of Russian air defence systems to Turkey. Washington claimed that Ankara was not acting like a NATO member when it bought armaments from Russia, but the Turkish government argued it had the right to boost the nation's defences as it pleases, especially in light of the US stalling the sale of its Patriot air defence systems to Turkey. After Ankara refused to scrap the S-400 deal, the US imposed a number of economic sanctions on Turkey's defence sector and refused to hand over the fifth-generation F-35 fighters that Turkish authorities earlier paid for. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the White House's actions, but insisted on keeping and deploying the S-400 air defences. The sources' claims come after Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier this week that Moscow's special military operation to demilitarise and de­-Nazify Ukraine, launched on 24 February, is going as planned. In the south of Ukraine, the Russian armed forces took control of the Kherson region, as well as the towns of Melitopol and Berdyansk, also blocking the city of Mariupol. This enabled Russian troops to cut off the Ukrainian Army from the coast of the Sea of Azov and unite with Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) units in the Donbass region. In the eastern direction, the DPR's People's Militia liberated the town of Volnovakha, advancing on the settlements of Verkhnetoretskoye and Novoselovka-2. Forces of the Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) are also conducting an offensive on Kiev's forces, with Russian troops taking control of the town of Balakleya in the Kharkov region. The Russian Defence Ministry has repeatedly stressed that the special operation only targets Ukraine's military infrastructure and that civilians are not in danger.

Last week, Erdogan pointed out that Turkey receives about half of its natural gas from Russia, and that Russia helps Turkey build the Akkuyu nuclear power plant. The Turkish president also said that he intends to hold phone conversations with the presidents of Russia and Ukraine, Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week. The United States, the EU and the UK have imposed sanctions against Russia after Moscow launched a military operation in Ukraine on 24 February. Some $300 billion in Russian foreign exchange reserves abroad ended up being frozen as a result of these sanctions, while Russian businesses were thus forced to find alternatives to Western-sourced machinery and equipment, spare parts, services, and consumer goods. Russia's military operation in Ukraine was initiated following calls from Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics to protect their civilians amid intensified shelling by Ukrainian forces. "

Last month, President Vladimir Putin recognised the independence of the LPR, but almost all of the world considers it to still be part of Ukraine. Speaking to journalists on Sunday, Leonid Pasechnik said that he thought “in the near future a referendum will be held in the republic, where people will exercise their absolutely constitutional right, and give their opinion with respect to joining Russia.” The official added that he was “somehow sure that’s precisely the way it will be.”Commenting on the possibility of such a vote in the LPR, Russian Senator Andrey Klishas said on Sunday that both Lugansk and Donetsk had the right to seek to join Russia unless such a move ran counter to their constitutions.However, Leonid Kalashnikov, who chairs the Russian Duma’s committee on the Commonwealth of Independent States Affairs, Eurasian Integration and Relations with Compatriots, has warned that “now is not the right moment” for holding a referendum in the republic. Kalashnikov argued that “you hardly need to bother with such questions when destiny is being determined on the frontline.”Both the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and the LPR declared independence in 2014 following a violent coup in Kiev. Both territories are predominantly Russian-speaking, and fears were growing at the time that nationalist elements in the new Ukrainian government would persecute ethnic minorities. Ukraine branded the two breakaway republics separatists and launched an ‘anti-terrorist operation,’ deploying its military to regain control, which resulted in a bloody war. The armed hostilities ended in February 2015 with the signing in the Belarusian capital of the so-called Minsk II peace agreement, brokered by Germany and France.The accord demanded that both the Ukrainian military and separatists cease fire and put an end to clashes, which had turned the region into a conflict zone. The document also called for major administrative and political reform in Ukraine as well as autonomy and local elections for the Donbass republics. However, the implementation of the agreement was stalled, with the two sides blaming each other for the lack of progress.In mid-February 2022, the DPR and LPR began reporting an uptick in Ukrainian artillery shelling – something which forced the Donbass republics to ask Russia for official recognition, as their respective leaderships claim. On February 21, Moscow recognized both republics as independent states, signing friendship treaties with Donetsk and Lugansk. However, parts of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions declared by the two republics as their own in their respective constitutions were still under Ukraine’s control.On February 24, Putin launched a military offensive in Ukraine. The Russian head of state insisted that the neighboring state had to be “demilitarized and denazified,” claiming that far-right militias, which had permeated the Ukrainian government, were supposedly aiming to carry out a genocide of the Russian-speaking population of the Donbass. Ukraine and its allies dismissed Putin’s allegations as a mere pretext, accusing Moscow of waging “unprovoked” aggression against a sovereign state."

It said it was planning to open an office in Rostov-on-Don to increase its ability to help those in need.“Our priority is to reach victims of armed conflict, wherever they are, in order to assist them,” the ICRC said.The decision to open an office in the city was taken by the charity following the visit to Russia of its president, Peter Maurer, from March 23 to 24.In an open letter to the ICRC on March 26, the chair of the public health committee of Ukraine’s parliament, Mikhail Radutskiy, said his body “strongly opposes” the opening of the ICRC’s office in Rostov-on-Don.“The Committee calls on the International Committee of the Red Cross not to legitimize ‘humanitarian corridors’ on the territory of the Russian Federation and not to support the abduction and forced deportation of Ukrainians. We call on you to change your decision on this issue,” the letter reads.Moscow denies Kiev’s allegations, accusing Ukrainian forces of having obstructed those humanitarian corridors and used civilians as a human shield.According to Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, Kiev has consistently opposed the evacuation of Ukrainians to Russia and “forcibly pushed” refugees to the west.Nonetheless, despite that opposition, since the launch of Russia’s “special military operation” on February 24, more than 400,000 people have been evacuated from Ukraine to Russia, according to the head of the Russian National Defense Management Center, Mikhail Mizintsev.Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two Donbass republics by force."

In the second segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Onyesonwu Chatoyer, organizer with the All-African People's Revolutionary Party and editor with Hood Communist to discuss how empathy is weaponized by the corporate media to serve the foreign policy objective of the US and to choose who deserves empathy, how that weaponization of empathy is currently being used to justify western intervention in Ukraine, and how the media has historically used empathy to justify other imperialist interventions and sell naked imperialism to people. In the third segment, Sean and Jacquie discuss a clip from Mumia Abu-Jamal discussing the propaganda effect of the idea of the United States as the “shining city upon a hill,” the historical use of this idea to justify the United States’ history of conquest, and how this mythology obscures the real history of the United States. Later in the show, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Esther Iverem, artist, author and independent journalist, and host and producer of On The Ground: Voices of Resistance from the Nation’s Capital, which you can listen to as a podcast and on Pacifica Radio to discuss reports that refugees of color from Ukraine are being kept in European Union detention centers despite assurances to the contrary at the beginning of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the double standard employed to deny asylum to Black refugees and accept thousands of Ukrainian refugees who according to the Peace Corps may hold racist views against Black people, the massive propaganda campaign that has been waged to manufacture consent for conflict with Russia, and the hypocrisy of calls to keep Russia accountable to international law despite its failure to stop US imperialism.

A joint British and Irish bid has been lodged for 2028, while Italy is also in the running for the 2032 edition. Russian media reported the country was planning such a move earlier on Wednesday after comments made by a member of the Russian Football Union's (RFU) executive committee.Rustem Saymanov, who is also general director at Rubin Kazan, told reporters of the federation's intentions, saying ""the RFU is going to apply for the European Championships in 2028 and 2032,"" according to TASS. “Life goes on with us, we are open and ready, we should not be closed to UEFA and FIFA. “We've held lots of competitions at a high level… There’s a lot of time, the situation will change, we will study everything.“I can’t say about 2028, but in 2032 – yes [we’ll bid]. We have now asked for documents to study all the requirements, we will wait,” he added.The declaration of interest from Russia comes amid a ban from UEFA on all Russian clubs and teams participating in international and club competitions, which was jointly announced alongside global counterpart FIFA as a response to Russia's military operation in Ukraine.The RFU launched an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to try and overturn the rulings, but was unsuccessful.Before the ban, UEFA also moved this season's Champions League final on May 28 from St. Petersburg to Paris.However, these developments haven't put the RFU off from launching a bid to see the Euros on Russian soil after the country successfully hosted the well-received 2018 World Cup, as well as seven matches at the pan-continental Euro 2020 tournament.As there were no other firm bids approaching the March 23 deadline, the UK and Ireland were expected to be awarded Euro 2028 as part of an expedited process with a UEFA executive committee meeting on April 7 providing the chance to confirm the decision.The UK and Ireland will now receive opposition from Russia and Turkey in separate bids for 2028, with UEFA also mentioning that Euro 2020 winners Italy want to host in 2032.An announcement made on who hosts both Euro 2028 and Euro 2032 will be made in September 2023, UEFA stated."

The operation in Ukraine was launched on 24 February, as Russia aimed to stop the eight-year war in Donbass waged by Kiev.

As the current situation in Ukraine unfolds, they may return this equipment to the eastern European nation.","The United States will reportedly transfer Soviet-made air defense weapons it obtained decades ago to bolster the Ukrainian military's arsenal amid the Kremlin's ongoing special military operation, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. Citing undisclosed sources within the government, the report details that the systems, which include the SA-8 Gecko (9K33 Osa in Russian designation), are decades old and were obtained by the US to assess Soviet military technology that was sold around the world. Officials are reported to have asserted that the armaments are known to the Ukraine military, which inherited the same type of equipment after the Soviet Union collapsed.  The United States, it is alleged, will tap into its arsenal of Soviet weapons, as the Biden administration pushes to provide Ukraine with more weapons to defend itself. According to the outlet, a Soviet-made cargo aircraft flew to a Huntsville, Alabama, airport in 1994, carrying an S-300 air defense system that the US had obtained in Belarus as part of a $100 million clandestine effort involving a Pentagon contractor. Some Soviet-made weapons were reportedly held at the Redstone Arsenal in Alabama, which serves as ""the Army's center for missile and rocket programs."" The sources indicated that at least some of what the US may provide for Ukraine's defense will come from that location. However, according to unnamed sources, the Belarus S-300 is not among the systems being provided to Ukraine. The annual government spending bill recently passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden reportedly includes clauses authorizing the transfer of aircraft, ammunition, vehicles, and other equipment to the Ukrainian military and NATO partners that are already overseas or in existing stockpiles. Staffers for Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, who pushed for the language, reportedly told the outlet that the revised legislation would also include Soviet-era air defense systems. Sources said Congress is informed of the US decision.  The S-300 Russian air defense system is already present in the Ukraine arsenal, but it is asserted by Kiev that its military needs more of missiles that operate at medium and long ranges. The shoulder-fired Stinger missiles continuing to be provided to Ukraine by the US and NATO countries are only effective against helicopters and nearby low-flying aircraft. The S-300, aka SA-10 under the NATO designation, is a long-range, modern air defense system designed to protect large territories over a considerably wider radius. The SA-8 is a tactical air defense system with a limited range that can move with ground units and provide cover against airplanes and helicopters. While the SA-8 has a lesser range, it is more maneuverable and may be easier to hide, according to military experts. According to the report, given that Kiev has repeatedly urged the West to create a no-fly zone over the country in the face of the unconditional superiority of the Russian air force, by this move the US hopes that Ukraine would be able to construct a de facto no-fly zone of its own. Both the US and a majority of NATO member states have rejected Kiev's request for a no-fly zone, as the move is feared to be perceived as a direct intervention in the ongoing military conflict and an escalation that could lead to nuclear war.  The Kremlin has repeatedly warned that it will consider NATO's attempts to introduce a no-fly zone as direct participation in the conflict, with ensuing consequences. Officials in the Biden administration have warned that taking such a step could lead to a direct conflict between the US-led alliance and Russia, something the US and the rest of the world is keen to avoid. Russia has repeatedly denounced sending lethal weapons into Ukraine as an escalation of the Kremlin's special military operation. During the ongoing military operation, Russian troops and the republics in Donbass regularly discover Western missiles and ammunition abandoned by the Ukrainian army and units of nationalists in settlements they leave behind.

As many as 15,000 Ukrainian troops and National Guard fighters are concentrated here, among them the 53rd Mechanized Brigade and the infamous neo-Nazi Azov battalion. Up to 150,000 civilians also remain trapped in areas controlled by nationalist forces.","Ukrainian forces have been attempting to disguise themselves as civilians in order to escape Russian and Donbass militia encirclement in Mariupol, with some even resorting to dressing up in women’s clothing, Donetsk People’s Militia battalion commander Oleg Kokarev has told Sputnik. “Well, for one thing, they are hiding behind civilians. And secondly, as we evacuate civilians, they try to escape disguised as civilians, to our side here, to blend in somewhere and get away,” Kokarev said. Kokarev reported multiple cases of attempts by militants to escape in women's clothing. Kokarev said suspected Ukrainian troops and National Guard fighters are questioned and sent to the proper authorities for further questioning after being caught. “Our boys do a good, nice job. So, victory is ours, we will win,” Kokarev stressed. The footage of a captured Ukrainian serviceman dressed in women’s clothing being taken out of the back of a military truck in Mariupol is reminiscent of videos from the conflict in Syria, where Syrian Army and Kurdish forces repeatedly reported cases of terrorist fighters trying to flee the battlefield dressed as women in head-to-toe burkas, or attempting to blend in with civilians by shaving their trademark beards en masse. The battle for Mariupol has become one of the deadliest in the course of the ongoing Russian military operation in Ukraine, with Russian and Donbass forces engaging Ukrainian troops and the Azov neo-Nazi militants in house-to-house fighting amid attempts by the latter to hide in residential areas, and in the Azovstal iron and steel works.  Mariupol was estimated to have had as many as 400,000 residents before the fighting began, with Donetsk People’s Republic head Denis Pushilin saying Wednesday that 150,000 civilians remain trapped in the city in areas controlled by nationalist formations. Russian and DPR troops are said to control about half of the city. On Tuesday, the Russian military called the humanitarian situation in the city “catastrophic,” and said that over 68,000 people had evacuated from the conflict zone without the Ukrainian government’s involvement. Earlier, DPR officials accused Kiev of deliberately trapping civilians in the city. "

The misery adds to the Azzurri’s absence at the World Cup in Russia four years ago.“I don't know what to say,” Italy boss Mancini told reporters. “Last summer was the most beautiful joy, now comes the greatest disappointment. It is not easy to think of other things, I am very sorry for the boys. I love them much more tonight than in July.“I am the coach, I am the first responsible, the boys are not. They have a great future, they are strong players for the future of the national team. We did not deserve this defeat.”Italian captain Giorgio Chiellini was crestfallen, calling the loss “a great hole.”  “I’m proud of my teammates, we are all destroyed and broken but we have to start again…,” said the 37-year-old.   “I hope that the coach will stay because he is essential for this team. Now we have to return to winning, go to the Euros and in four years’ time return to this blessed World Cup.”Chelsea midfield star Jorginho, who missed two crucial spot-kicks during the group-stage campaign as Italy were consigned to the playoffs after finishing behind Switzerland, was tearful as he said the ordeal will “haunt him for the rest of his life.”“We played good football, we won the European Championship last summer, but unfortunately in the last few games we made small errors and were unable to recover from them. They made the difference,” he told RAI Sport. “It hurts when I think about it, because I do still think about it and it will haunt me for the rest of my life. Stepping up there twice and not being able to help your team and your country is something that I will carry with me forever, and it weighs on me.“People say we need to lift our heads and carry on, but it’s tough.”Much of the attention before Thursday night had focused on what seemed to be an inevitable Italy-Portugal playoff final with a spot in Qatar at stake.The Portuguese kept up their end of the bargain with a 3-1 win against Turkey in Porto, thanks to goals from Otavio, Diogo Jota and Matheus Nunes, although the visitors spurned a chance to make it 2-2 in the 85th minute when Burak Yilmaz blazed a penalty over the crossbar.Rather than facing Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo and Co. will now meet a North Macedonia team riding a wave of confidence after shutting out the European Champions at Stadio Renzo Barbera, facing 32 shots from the Italians – but just five of which were on target.North Macedonia coach Blagoja Milevski said his team had done an Italian Job on their rivals.“We won Italian style against the Italians, a goal with two shots on target,” he told reporters. “I’m very happy for this victory, I’m proud for these guys.”North Macedonia will be aiming for a first-ever World Cup appearance, having played at the European Championships for the first time last summer.Elsewhere in European qualifying, Wales overcame Austria 2-1 in their playoff semifinal in Cardiff thanks to a Gareth Bale double.They will play the winner of the tie between Scotland and Ukraine, although that match has been postponed due to the conflict in Ukraine.Sweden defeated the Czech Republic 1-0 after an extra-time goal from Robin Quaison in Stockholm. The Swedes will next face Poland, who were granted a bye into the playoff final after original opponents Russia were banned by FIFA due to the military offensive in Ukraine.  "

The remark came in response to threats made by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who warned China on Thursday that Washington would “impose costs” on it should Beijing choose to support Moscow.Lijian stated that “on the Ukraine issue, China has always acted objectively and impartially and made independent judgments based on the merits of the matter itself.”The Chinese diplomat also stressed that pressure from Washington would not make Beijing change its stance. He added that some US officials were still trying to spread disinformation regarding China’s position – something Lijian described as irresponsible and not conducive to the resolution of the crisis.In China’s view, the US ought to “seriously reflect on its role in the Ukraine crisis,” as well as “earnestly assume its due responsibilities.” Lijian also called on Washington to “take practical actions to ease the situation and solve the problem, rather than continue to add fuel to the fire.”On Friday, US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping will hold talks via telephone, with the Ukraine crisis high on the agenda. Biden is expected to repeat warnings made earlier by Blinken regarding any possible actions China may take to “support Russia’s aggression.”On Thursday, China’s Commerce Ministry spokesperson, Gao Feng, made it clear that China opposed “any form of unilateral sanctions that have no basis in international law.” According to the official, such punitive measures “not only fail to resolve security issues, but also harm the lives of ordinary people, disrupt global markets, and make the world’s already slowing economy even worse.”The statement came hard on the heels of Jake Sullivan’s warning to China on Sunday, in which Joe Biden’s national security adviser cautioned that Beijing would “absolutely” face consequences should it help Moscow evade Western sanctions.Since February 24, when Russia launched its military offensive against Ukraine, the US, Canada, the whole of the EU, as well as several other nations, have slapped a slew of crippling economic sanctions on Moscow. The country’s central bank and several major commercial banks, as well as entire industries, have been targeted.China has consistently refused to impose punitive measures on Russia.Moscow attacked its neighbor last months following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the 2014-15 Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia also outlined the goals to “demilitarize” and “denazify” the country. Kiev maintains the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

Kirby did not provide any further information to back up this claim.","The Pentagon does not have sufficient information on what's going on in the Kremlin to make judgement calls about what President Putin is or isn't informed about, presidential spokesman Dmitri Peskov has said. ""This is not only a pity, but a cause for concern, because it is precisely this sort of complete misunderstanding that leads to erroneous decisions, reckless decisions which have very bad consequences,"" Peskov said. Peskov's comments follow a flurry of statements by US officials over the past 24 hours about the extent to which the Russian president has or hasn't been informed about the operation in Ukraine and other matters. On Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby suggested that Putin had ""not been fully informed"" by the Russian military ""at every turn,"" and ""concurred"" with press reports citing anonymous officials claiming that Putin had been ""misinformed"" by advisors on the Russian military's performance in Ukraine, and about the impact of anti-Russian sanctions. ""I've seen these press reports attributed to a US official, and we would concur with the basic finding, but we are not going to get any more specific than that,"" Kirby said. Separately on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken cited ""newly released intelligence"" suggesting that Putin's advisors were ""not telling him the truth about how Russian forces are faring in Ukraine"" and not ""speaking truth to power."" US officials' comments follow a string of reports in US media and news agencies citing unnamed officials and intelligence personnel claiming that Putin had been ""misled"" by ""fearful advisors"" on Ukraine and other matters.

According to the Italian criminal code, incitement to commit a crime is a punishable offence,” the diplomat told reporters.“I, as a citizen of Russia who is currently in Italy, submitted a complaint to Rome’s prosecutor office with a request to carefully, objectively and impartially investigate this case,” Razov added.The offending article, titled ‘Ukraine-Russia war: could killing Putin be the only way out’, was printed by the newspaper earlier this week. Penned by Domenico Quirico, an international politics and war expert, the piece muses about the “tyrannicides” of the past, such as assassination of Roman dictator Julius Caesar or killing of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, which ultimately sparked the First World War.The author shares his thoughts about the implications such acts had and the “petty” motives high-profile assassinations may have behind them without providing an answer as to whether Russian President Vladimir Putin should be killed or not.La Stampa has already responded to the allegations raised by the Russian ambassador, insisting that it had not called for the killing of the country’s president. “Let the Russian embassy get a better translator. I wrote that killing Putin was immoral,” the author of the controversial article wrote.The Italian outlet got itself entangled in another controversy over the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, last week. On March 16, it printed a frontpage image showing the aftermath of a ballistic missile strike on Donetsk by Ukrainian forces, which it falsely stated illustrated Russian attacks in Kiev and Lviv.The attack on the capital city of the breakaway republic left at least 21 civilians killed and scores injured.The bizarre pick of illustration prompted allegations of deliberate misinformation attempt by the newspaper. The Russian Foreign Minister said that the newspaper, like other Western mainstream media, was intentionally “distorting the perceptions of its own readers.”La Stampa, however, insisted that choosing an image showing destruction caused by Kiev's forces to illustrate the purported suffering of Ukrainians at the hands of Russians was an acceptable move as it merely showed the “clear horror of the war” without assigning blame on any party.“The thing that bothers me most and pains me a lot is that there are also some people here in Italy, some disgraced people of the web, who amplify this and call it a case of disinformation. Where is the disinformation?” La Stampa editor-in-chief Massimo Giannini stated."

The last final that I was working on was in Kiev,” he added.“The last World Cup I contributed to organize as FIFA president was in Russia, the last final was in Moscow.“The Russia World Cup in 2018 was by all means a great World Cup, a great success sportingly and culturally.”“But obviously it did not solve the problems in the world, it did not even solve the problems in the region. It did not create a lasting peace,” said Infantino. “Once this terrible conflict is over – and all other conflicts around the world as well – hopefully very soon football can play a small part in rebuilding relationships, in establishing peace and understanding...“My plea to all of those who have some power in this world, in important political positions, please stop conflicts and wars, for our children, for our future.“Please engage in dialogue, even with your worst enemy, please try to come together. Football will be there in helping to work together for peace,” he added.Commenting on the developments, honorary RFU president Vyacheslav Koloskov told Match TV it was a “good sign” for Russian membership.“This suggests that among the majority of members of the congress there was no desire to mix politics with sports,” said Koloskov, who is a former FIFA vice-president, adding that an extraordinary FIFA Congress on Russian membership was not likely.The current suspension of Russian teams and clubs ensured that the men’s national team missed out on the chance to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup – the draw for which takes place in Doha on Friday.Russia were due to face Poland in a playoff semifinal in Moscow on March 24, with the winners facing either Sweden or the Czech Republic in the Russian capital five days later.Instead, Poland were handed direct passage to the playoff final and defeated Sweden in Chorzow on Tuesday night, booking their spot in Qatar. Russia has appealed its UEFA and FIFA suspensions with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland, but thus far without success.A definitive CAS decision has yet to be issued, however, with a panel being formed but no hearing date fixed at present."

He added that today's negotiations were ""constructive"" in their nature. He noted that Kiev's written proposals signalled Ukraine's readiness for compromise. The head of the Russian delegation also revealed other proposals discussed with the Ukrainian delegation: The Ukrainian delegation proposed making the permanent members of the UN Security Council, as well as Germany, Canada, Poland, Israel, and Turkey the guarantor states that would ensure Ukraine's security. Medinsky elaborated that the position of Kiev will be reviewed by Moscow and presented to President Vladimir Putin. After that, the Kremlin will give its response on whether it agrees to include Kiev's propositions in a final agreement between Russia and Ukraine, the negotiator explained. Medinsky said that the Russian delegation is leaving Istanbul on 29 March and that further negotiations between Ukraine and Russia will continue via video conferences for now. The Russian chief negotiator also announced Moscow's plans to take military and political de-escalation steps. The military de-escalation will take the form of a ""significant reduction"" of military activities in the Kiev and Chernigov directions. The political de-escalation step suggests the possibility of a personal meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents at the stage of preliminary approval of the final version of the agreement. The Russian Defence Ministry explained the decision to de-escalate the military situation by the fact that negotiations on Ukraine's neutral and non-nuclear status, as well as security guarantees for the country, have become more ""practical"". The ministry stated that the step was necessary to increase a level of mutual trust in negotiations and ultimately to sign an agreement. The head of the Russian delegation later noted that military de-escalation does not entail a ceasefire in the Kiev and Chernigov directions. At the same time, he noted that Russia understands that decision-makers are located in Kiev and thus does not want to put Kiev at greater risk. Medinsky, in turn, said that Presidents Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky could discuss political details of the agreement when they meet for the initialling of the agreement. During the previous rounds of talks, the delegations only managed to agree on opening humanitarian corridors to evacuate citizens from Ukrainian cities where the country’s military and nationalist battalions were fighting troops of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR), as well as Russian forces taking part in the special military operation. The latter was launched on 24 February by Putin in response to a request from the DPR and LPR to defend them against continued attacks by Kiev's forces. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Irina Venediktova claimed that all the troops are treated according to the Geneva Convention and medical care is available in the camps. However, numerous Russian prisoners of war have been filmed in ""confession"" videos, since the start of the conflict. As for Ukrainian captives, Vereshchuk asserted that Ukraine has not yet managed to distinguish more recent ones from those held since 2014, when the conflict in Donbass region broke out. ""There are several hundreds of them,"" the deputy prime minister said. ""But, if we roughly separate it, we roughly know that there are about 270 of our prisoners. The ones that are recorded, the ones that we have in the register. In total [since 2014] there are about 650 of them."""

Putin has warned that any such move, which would require Western states to police the zone, would be viewed as participation in the military conflict, with all that implies. Biden's officials have rejected the idea and said that providing fighter jets to Ukraine would pose a “high risk” of escalating the war.Beyond the implications of a direct NATO military confrontation with Russia, there are other challenges to providing Zelensky with the weapons he wants. UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace pointed out on Saturday that Ukraine’s military isn’t set up to use the most advanced Western weapons.“One of the biggest challenges is that the more you go up in sophistication of weapons systems, the more training you require to use them, which is why the real focus of effort has to be on helping the Ukrainians either refurbish or locate Russian or Soviet equipment that is already in their inventory,” Wallace told the UK’s Daily Mail newspaper. “Just providing British tanks wouldn’t really work.”However, Wallace said, British-made anti-aircraft equipment – shoulder-mounted Starstreak missiles that can shoot down low-flying warplanes – would be provided to Ukraine.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

Citing the evidence from emails obtained from the notorious abandoned laptop of the president's son, the outlet reported that he helped secure millions of dollars of funding for Metabiota, a Department of Defense contractor specializing in research on pandemic-causing diseases that could be used as bioweapons. Biden also introduced Metabiota to an allegedly corrupt Ukrainian gas firm, Burisma, for a ""science project"" involving high biosecurity level labs in the Eastern European nation. According to the report, Metabiota is a medical data company, but its vice president wrote Hunter in 2014 to discuss how they could ""assert Ukraine's cultural and economic independence from Russia,"" thus giving rise to speculation about the company's goals. Hunter may have reportedly played a key role in ensuring Metabiota was able to perform pathogen research close to the Russian border, according to emails and defense contracts obtained by the outlet. The younger Biden and his colleagues at Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners (RSTP), an investment firm he purportedly owned, consistently raised millions of dollars for technology companies, and Metabiota was not an exception. Hunter and his coworkers reportedly exchanged emails about how the company's medical data monitoring may become a crucial tool for governments and businesses attempting to spot infectious disease outbreaks. However, Hunter was also allegedly heavily involved in Metabiota's activities in Ukraine. In Hunter's April 2014 investor pitches, he reportedly stated that they not only helped the company receive financing, but also helped ""get new customers,"" including ""government agencies in the case of Metabiota."" The company's vice president, Mary Guttieri, wrote a memo to Biden, outlining the unexplained goal of moving Ukraine closer to the West, according to the report. Guttieri also reportedly played a key role in Metabiota's Ukraine operations, meeting with other company executives and US and Ukrainian military officials in October 2016 to discuss ""cooperation in surveillance and prevention of especially dangerous infectious diseases, including zoonotic diseases in Ukraine and neighboring countries."" According to the Daily Mail, Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi responded to Hunter four days after Guttieri's April 2014 email, indicating that the vice president's son had presented a ""science project"" involving Burisma, on whose board of directors he served, and Metabiota in Ukraine. Pozharskyi purportedly asked Biden to take a look at ""few initial points"" of the purposes to look into ""the potential of this as you called, 'Science Ukraine' project."" Pozharskyi claimed in an email to Hunter that B&amp;V had worked on ""similar or the same projects"" as the proposed contract for Metabiota and that he had known several of such biological research projects in his previous role as a Ukrainian government official. The outlet quoted US government expenditure records, which mentioned that Metabiota was awarded a $18.4 million contract by the Department of Defense between February 2014 and November 2016, with $307,091 allotted for ""Ukraine research projects.""  In 2010, the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency purportedly commissioned B&amp;V to build a Biological Safety Level 3 laboratory in Odessa, Ukraine, which ""provided enhanced equipment and training to effectively, safely and securely identify especially dangerous pathogens."" Such labs are reportedly used to ""study infectious agents or toxins that may be transmitted through the air and cause potentially lethal infections."" On Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia will demand explanations about the involvement of the younger Biden in biological laboratories in Ukraine. Peskov stressed that the issue of biological laboratories in Ukraine is ""very sensitive information - both for us and for the whole world."" He also noted that in addition to Russia, China also demanded an explanation of Hunter's connection with these biological laboratories. The Kremlin spokesman suggested that the US is trying to divert attention by alleging that Russia would use chemical weapons, which Moscow vehemently denied. New data sharply raises the question about ""what the Americans were doing in Ukraine and what could happen because of all this research."" Let's stay in touch no matter what!

The official also claimed that although “from time to time, we hear absolutely astonishing remarks,” Russia’s leadership was polite and never got personal. According to Medvedev, “ethics and good manners” are what stops Moscow from taking cheap shots at other countries’ top officials, despite harsh remarks directed at their Russian counterparts.Every country has something to deal with, be it elections or a crisis, or the need to create a coalition. And so they need a target or an enemy. In this case, Russia is the designated enemy, so I’m not surprised by the rhetoric.Medvedev also argued that Russophobia dated back several centuries, manifesting itself at certain points in history particularly clearly. The official cited the Russian 19th century poet Fyodor Tyutchev, “who talked about how the West ganged up on Russia 150 years ago and did everything in their power to turn us into outcasts and pariahs.”The politician went on to call out the West’s double standards and America’s feeling that it is an “ultimate decision-maker,” despite the fact that its military activities overseas have often resulted in massive loss of life.The former president pointed out that the European countries criticizing Moscow now “don’t have a monopoly on Europeanness,” as Russia’s “history is just as European as theirs.” So, any attempts to represent Russia as no longer European sound “ridiculous,” Medvedev claimed."

They were finally able to go home and rest, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Monday.A new Ukrainian team arrived to replace their colleagues, while 13 people from the previous shift declined to rotate, the Vienna-based agency said. Most Ukrainian security guards remained on site as well.“It is a positive – albeit long overdue – development,” IAEA Director General Mariano Rafael Grossi said on Sunday when the long-awaited rotation began.The new shift includes two supervisors instead of the usual one as a back-up in case of emergencies. Ukrainian officials at the plant thanked the outgoing workers for having “heroically performed their professional duties.”Chernobyl’s reactor, which exploded in 1986, is covered by the ‘New Safe Confinement’, a large hangar-like structure that prevents further contamination.The IAEA added that the Zaporozhskaya Nuclear Power Plant, which is also under Russian control, was operating at two-thirds of its maximum capacity after two damaged power lines were repaired. The agency quoted the Ukrainian authorities as saying that “safety systems were fully functional” at the plant.Moscow attacked the neighboring state in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk peace agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country and it that will never join the US-led NATO bloc.

The situation in the city remains tense, with residents lacking food and electricity and having to leave the city amid continued armed clashes in the downtown area. ","Mariupol resident Nina Kulayeva has told Sputnik that scores of people died after neo-Nazis from Ukraine's Azov Regiment deliberately destroyed the Neptune swimming pool in the centre of the southeastern coastal city currently surrounded by Russian and Donetsk People's Republic forces. The woman suggested that by obliterating the pool, members of the Azov Regiment apparently wanted to intimidate the local population. According to Kulayeva, it was Azov militants who blew up a drama theatre in Mariupol earlier this week. Russia Rejects Allegations of Bombing Mariupol Theatre  She spoke after Ukrainian authorities earlier accused the Russian military of carrying out an airstrike on the Mariupol Drama Theatre on 16 March. The Russian Ministry of Defence rejected the accusations, stressing that its aviation ""did not implement any tasks regarding strikes on ground targets"" in Mariupol. The ministry earlier accused the Azov detachment of using heavy Grad artillery to strike residential areas and a school on the outskirts of Mariupol, which killed multiple civilians. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of the Russian National Defence Control Centre, has since said that Moscow informed Kiev that it is ready to let militants leave Mariupol via humanitarian corridors to save the city and its civilians. He added that Russia is ready to give guarantees to militants that they will not be harmed if they lay down their arms. Mariupol has been the site of intense fighting between the forces of Ukraine and the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) in recent weeks. On 7 March, DPR forces said that they had encircled the city and started clearing it of Ukrainian troops and extremist battalions, including the Azov Regiment. According to a Sputnik correspondent, there was no electricity in the city on Friday, while the population has run out of provision as there are no food supplies. In addition, almost all of the stores are either destroyed or have been looted, the correspondent added. On 24 February, Moscow launched a special military operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine after weeks of escalating shelling, sabotage, and sniper attacks by Ukrainian forces against the Donbass republics, whose predominantly Russian-speaking population has been subjected to ""abuse and genocide […] for eight years"", according to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Moscow has repeatedly stated that the goal of the operation is to neutralise Ukraine's military capacity and not harm the civilian population of the country. The Azov Regiment, formed in 2014 as a group of neo-Nazi volunteer paramilitaries and infamous for their 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich-style rune logo, has since been integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard.

Speaking to EU leaders via video link on Friday, the Ukrainian president thanked the Baltic states, Poland, France, and Germany for their support, but noted that Hungary was still declining to take a stand. He called on Budapest to “decide for yourself who you are with.” Addressing Orban directly, Zelensky asked him if he knew “what’s going on in Mariupol,” referring to the besieged southern port city, which has seen heavy fighting in recent days.Zelensky reiterated his request that his country’s application to join the EU be swiftly considered, and once again appealed to Hungary in particular not to block the bid.Unlike the other EU member states bordering Ukraine, Hungary has so far refused to either send weapons to Kiev or let other countries move such shipments through its territory.Orban has argued that, as around 85% of its gas and over 60% of its oil is imported from Russia, it would not be in Budapest’s best interest to rile Moscow.In his latest statement, however, the Hungarian prime minister emphasized that “it must be made clear to the Russians that it is not worth pursuing this war,” warning at the same time that Europe should avoid hurting itself “more than the Russians.” He also called on Brussels to provide Hungary with more funding to deal with the influx of Ukrainian refugees."

They’re also prohibited from having ships or aircraft dock or land in the country.In addition to the Russian president, the sanctions target Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, former president Dmitry Medvedev, FSB chief Alexander Bortnikov, and Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu. New Zealand also banned hundreds of other Russians from traveling to the country, but no one with major holdings in the South Pacific nation was included on the sanctions list.“This is just the start, with more sanctions coming over the next few weeks,” Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said in a statement. “We expect to progressively announce more substantive sanctions as officials work through the appropriate process required under legislation.”The first round of sanctions also targets 19 entities, including state-backed Promsvyazbank (PSB), banning it from having assets in New Zealand or providing services to its citizens. New Zealanders are prohibited from dealing with technology firms Integral and Research and Production, military industrial giants UralVagonZavod and Almaz-Antey Corporation, as well as nearly a dozen Donbass militia groups and organizations."

Rogozin recalled that from March 2017 to April 2018 he was at the helm of a government commission on biological and chemical safety, a panel that he said often dealt with the issue of the US ""encircling"" Russia with its biological laboratories. Rogozin's remarks come after the Russian Defence Ministry revealed earlier this month that one of the goals of the biological research laboratories in Ukraine suspected of having been funded by the US was the creation of bioagents capable of targeting certain ethnic groups. Kirillov stressed that the Russian Defence Ministry had obtained documents confirming that the high-risk biological research in Ukraine was led by US specialists. He added that the documents also showed that the US Defence Department funded the biological research in Ukraine, spending over $200 million to study pathogens of birds, bats, and reptiles in Ukraine and the possibility of transmission of African swine fever and anthrax through these animals. US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland previously admitted that ""Ukraine has biological research facilities"", saying that Washington was ""working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach"". She, however, did not elaborate on whether Washington took part in the biological research in Ukraine. Russia started a special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February in response to calls from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics for protection against intensifying attacks by Ukrainian troops. The Russian Defence Ministry said the operation is only targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure and the civilian population is not in danger. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

In a recent episode of his show ""The Joe Rogan Experience"", Rogan recalled the screenshot that ""someone sent me"" about the US media coverage of Ukraine before the current conflict. Rogan termed Ukraine ""the most corrupt nation in Europe,"" with a ""increasingly corrupt and authoritarian leader"" attempting to deepen an ""alliance with the far-right,"" as he read off headlines from a screenshot. The publications in question came from the World Socialist Web Site, the right-wing Cato Institute, and the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN. Rogan also verbally attacked Big Tech corporations like Meta's Facebook* and other social media platforms for permitting violent speech toward the Russian government and its military, in addition to condemning the media for changing its narrative on Ukraine.  The Russian court has recently labeled Meta as an extremist organization for allowing the calls for violence against Russians during the Kremlin's ongoing special military operation across Ukraine. In 2017, the New York Times reported on a policy pursued by the previous Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, to ""whitewash"" World War II Ukrainian nationalists who openly collaborated with Nazi occupation authorities in the mid-20th century and displayed anti-Semitism and direct participation in Nazi crimes against humanity. The article, written by the head of the Ukrainian Jewish Committee, went on to highlight how neo-Nazis frequently desecrated Holocaust memorials and places in Ukraine, as historical revisionism of that country's dark past has ramped up to whitewash not only Ukrainian nationalists, but the conduct of the remaining modern neo-Nazis. In 2018, the Atlantic Council published a report on known far-right groups in Ukraine that rose to prominence after the 2014 coup d'état.

Protects ‘Another Country's Border, But Not Our Own’",https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/img/07e5/04/1b/1082738841_0:0:1280:853_1440x900_80_0_1_c114b428daf263f4c8f2acb51bfa09b5.jpg?source-sid=cc_by-sa_20,Fox News host Tucker Carlson has questioned why the Biden administration has opted to deploy additional troops to NATO members in Eastern Europe to bolster their security amid the ongoing military actions in Ukraine but has neglected to shore up the US' own “porous” southern border. ,"Officials at the US Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection and other agencies are bracing for another migrant influx in the upcoming months. Last year’s record-breaking immigration rates prompted an outcry from GOP officials and lawmakers, who blame the current administration’s eased border policies for the spike in migration. Tucker Carlson pulled no punches over the Biden administration's southern border policy. He cited figures across the American southwest that show an increase in crime and instability. He blamed the current administration for the increased crime rate not only in Houston but in other cities in Texas and other states “where millions of illegal aliens have flooded in during Joe Biden's presidency.” Carlson also mentioned another issue that has become a source of constant criticism from Republicans – fentanyl overdoses, which, last year, surpassed heroin overdoses. Fentanyl, an easily produced synthetic opioid, has been one of the main drugs trafficked from Mexico into the United States and has accounted for over 100,000 deaths and 64% of all drug overdoses in the US. Carlson attacked Democrat lawmakers, who are calling for the abolition of Title 42, a Trump-era law that empowers the authorities to extradite illegal immigrants due to pandemic concerns. Earlier in the week, authorities were preparing to encounter 170,000 immigrants over the upcoming months if Biden decides to stop extraditions under Title 42, with DHS calling on its workers to volunteer at the southern border. Illegal immigration traditionally peaks seasonally in the spring and early summer. Historically, the month of May sees the most illegal border crossings.   Meanwhile, US Border Patrol agents reported 164,973 encounters with migrants stopped from illegally crossing the southern border in February, which is a 63 percent increase compared to the same period last year. Nevertheless, it is less than the 20-year record of 212,000 encounters, reported by the DHS in June last year. Carlson claimed that the US military can be used to solve the problem of “open borders” and stop the “invasion.” He criticized the decision to send “thousands of American troops and billions in American military hardware to Eastern Europe to help Ukrainians restore their borders,” wondering “why not here.” Since the start of the Russian military operation on February 24, Washington has announced plans to deploy additional troops to Eastern European NATO members.  The Pentagon has already sent approximately 7,500 soldiers along with military equipment to Poland, Romania, Germany, and the Baltic States “to respond to the current security environment in light of Russia's renewed aggression against Ukraine” and to bolster the alliance’s eastern frontiers.

The budget presentation was the last for Prime Minister Scott Morrison's Liberal coalition government, which faces a tough re-election in May.","Australia on Tuesday announced its “largest-ever investment” in bolstering the country’s cyber and intelligence capabilities, as it unveiled a $7.43 billion (9.9 billion AUD) investment over the next 10 years to bolster the size and capabilities of the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD). “REDSPICE will substantially increase ASD’s offensive cyber capabilities, its ability to detect and respond to cyber-attacks, and introduce new intelligence capabilities”, Dutton stated. Dutton’s apparent reference was to China, , which has accused the US and its Pacific allies such as Australia of ""inciting"" an arms race in the region through the activities of groupings such as AUKUS and Quad (comprised of Australia, India, Japan, and the US). ""It acknowledges the nature of conflict has changed, with cyberattacks now commonly preceding other forms of military intervention – most recently demonstrated by offensive cyber activity against Ukraine"", Dutton also remarked. The federal budget presented by Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg also committed an approximately $431 billion (575 billion AUD) outlay to ramp up Canberra's defence capabilities by the end of the decade. As per the budget papers, around half a trillion dollars in investments will go into upgrading Canberra's defence capabilities and infrastructure, besides expanding the size of the Australian Defence Forces (ADF) to around 18,500 by 2040. Australia has announced a plan to construct at least three new bases along its eastern coast to station the advanced nuclear-attack submarines (SSNs) it is expected to develop thanks to British or US technologies under the AUKUS arrangement. The announced budget also includes funding for acquiring ""new uncrewed aerial surveillance systems, Ch-47F Chinook helicopters, Abrams tanks, and combat engineering vehicles"", as per Dutton. ""The government will also upgrade and extend in-service support for the Hawk 127 Lead-In Fighter Training System that will result in a $ 1.2 billion (AUD 1.5 billion) investment in the Air Force’s future aviation capability"", the minister said. Dutton said that the expanded Australian defence force would “enable us to deliver our nuclear-powered submarines, ships, aircraft and advanced weapons”. Prime Minister Morrison said that the investments announced in the budget would increase Canberra's defence spending past 2 percent of its overall gross domestic product (GDP). In comparative terms, the US is by far the world's biggest defence spender, with its current budgetary outlay exceeding $750 billion. While China is the second biggest defence spender, it spends almost three times less than the US in military expenditures. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

If our girls took to the ice, she would have no chance of winning first place.""Top Russian skaters such as Beijing 2022 team event gold medalist Kamila Valieva plus women's singles event gold and silver medalists Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova are absent from the ongoing World Championships in France due to an ISU ban on Russian athletes imposed in response to the military operation in Ukraine. While Tarasova said that Sakamoto ""did everything cleanly"" to lead the way in her short program, she described the Japanese star's routine as a ""skate from 20 years ago"".""All the elements were done, but there were no elements of the highest complexity, and our girls strive and do the highest complexity, [to] develop in technical perfection,"" Tarasova said, with there also no triple axels performed by any of the women in France, unlike the Russian elite such as Valieva.Tarasova said that Russian skaters, had they been allowed to compete, would have been ""the first everywhere.""""The Japanese [girl] skated well, but this is not a high level, of course,"" Tarasova balked.Tarasova's comments are backed by Olympic bronze medalist Sakamoto leading the short program with a score of 80.32, which though 5.32 points clear of second-placed Belgian Loena Hendrickx is still paltry compared to the numbers that top Russian skaters produce.In recent months, Valieva set a world record 90.45 short program tally at the European Championships in January, which broke her own previous world record of 87.42 at the Rostelecom Cup last November.Tarasova has also fired back at Canadian journalist Beverley Smith who tweeted that ""though were no triple Axels to be seen,"" the short program was a ""sane"" event compared to the ""crazy drama at the Olympics,"" where Valieva was caught up in a doping scandal due to a failed drug test from the Russian Championships on December 25 that did not surface until after the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) had won the Team event in Beijing.""Sigh of relief: no Russian skaters or judges. Love it. It wasn't the skating or sport world that really made this happen: it was the war in Ukraine,"" Smith added.Catching wind of this, Tarasova remarked to Sport-Express: ""I want to upset Beverley: we will only be gone a year, and we will return with even greater strength.""Tarasova's comments on the World Championships echo those made by a former student and Sochi 2014 singles champion Adelina Sotnikova, who said: ""If you look at the big picture, the World Championships was interesting because there were Russian athletes.""And now, for example, it will be boring for me to watch it, because our athletes have set such a high bar."" The women's stars in Montpellier will complete their free skate routines on Friday as the medals are confirmed. Meanwhile, Russian stars Valieva and Shcherbakova will be among those competing in the exhibition Channel One Cup in their homeland, which is an alternative to their enforced World Championships absence. "

India continues to resist pressure to openly condemn Russia for its military actions in Ukraine.“We exchanged views at length in a small group today in an in-depth manner on the situation in Ukraine,” Kishida said at a joint press conference with Modi. “The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a grave incident shaking the very essence of the international order. We must respond in a firm and resolute manner.“We confirmed any unilateral change to the status quo by force cannot be forgiven in any region, and it is necessary to seek peaceful resolutions of disputes based on international law,” Kishida added, as he stood beside Modi.However, the Indian prime minister refrained from addressing the Ukraine crisis directly, only saying that “geopolitical events are posing new challenges.” He instead spoke about further strengthening the India-Japan partnership to “encourage peace, prosperity and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and on the global level.”A joint statement issued after the talks voiced “serious concern about the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis” in Ukraine, and urged an “immediate cessation of violence,” without censuring Russia.India has come under increased Western pressure to distance itself from Moscow and sever its economic ties, after it abstained from a United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning Russia's military action in Ukraine, choosing instead to remain neutral alongside China, Pakistan, South Africa, and 30 other countries.India is also facing criticism for buying Russian oil, available at discounted prices as some countries have been avoiding it in fear of retaliatory sanctions from the US. The Indian government, however, has reportedly adopted a pragmatic approach and was “exploring all possibilities” to ensure the country's own energy security.Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “special military operation” in Ukraine on February 24, with a stated goal to “demilitarize and denazify” its government, ensuring that its NATO membership aspirations no longer pose a threat to either Russia or the newly recognized Donbass republics, which have suffered seven years of siege by Kiev forces. The US and its allies have accused Russia of starting an “unprovoked” invasion to occupy Ukraine."

It instead accused Ukraine of being the culprit.The rebuke came in response to Zelensky’s Wednesday address to the Norwegian parliament, during which the Ukrainian leader accused the Russian military of “creating the worst threat to international security since World War II” through its “insidious” operations in the Black Sea.“About a hundred ships cannot leave to the Mediterranean. Some ships have been simply seized in acts of piracy aimed at stealing the cargo. Some ships were attacked,” Zelensky said.“But the blockade of the ports was done by Russia not only through use of naval forces. They have deployed mines in the sea. And now the mines set up by the Russian forces are drifting in the sea. They pose a threat to anyone, to ships and ports of every nation in the Black Sea region.”Mining its shores and territorial waters has long been part of Ukraine’s strategy of defending against a Russian attack from the Black Sea, which it started implementing after the hostilities broke out. On March 5, its armed forces warned residents of the Odessa region to stay away from the sea because of the mines being deployed by the military.“We call on fishermen and owners of boats not to move near the shore of the Odessa region to avoid the risk of being fired upon or contacting mine barriers,” the message said.According to the Russian defense ministry, Ukraine deployed some 420 old YaM-1 moored naval mines along its shores, including 370 in the Black Sea. About ten of them went adrift after their cables snapped during a storm earlier this month, the Russian military believes.At least two apparent mines were reported found and have since been destroyed: one by the Turkish military and one in Romanian territorial waters. “Nobody knows where the rest of them are drifting,” the Thursday statement said, adding that Kiev’s mining operations created a major threat to shipping in the Black Sea.The Russian ministry said that the second charge voiced by Zelensky during his video address was likewise “a lie”. The reality is that Ukraine is preventing 68 foreign ships from sailing from its ports of Chernomorsk, Odessa, Nikolaev and Yuzhny, while the Russian Navy is offering daily opportunities of safe passage to them.“Crews of the ships radioed us and said any attempt by a foreign vessel to depart the Ukrainian ports is banned by the authorities under a threat of immediate sinking,” General Igor Konashenkov, the spokesman for the defense ministry, said.Zelensky is currently on a virtual tour to whip up support for his nation, with addresses made to various Western nations each day. On Tuesday, he told the Danish parliament that transition to renewable energy is a moral imperative for the EU, because otherwise it would not be able to punish Russia by stopping buying its energy.Ukraine earns billions of dollars each year in gas transit fees. Only a few months ago, Zelensky's government for asking for the arrangement to be extended for another 15 years. "

Among the seized equities were two yachts belonging to billionaires Alexei Mordashov and Gennady Timchenko, and several properties worth €28 million belonging to other individuals. Later, the government also reported a seizure of what is said to be the largest private sailing-assisted motor yacht in the world, a $580-million vessel linked to Russian businessman Andrei Melnichenko.In a separate development, the Netherlands also announced a freeze of more Russian assets on Tuesday. As of March 21, the Netherlands has frozen nearly €392 million in Russian assets and transactions, Finance Minister Sigrid Kaag wrote in a letter to the Lower House of the Dutch Parliament.According to the letter published on the website of the Dutch government, the largest part, €242 million, constitutes assets placed with trust offices. Nearly €145 million was frozen in banks and almost €4 million in asset management firms. Nearly €380,000 has been frozen in pensions.Last week, the Netherlands reported a seizure of €200 million in Russian property. Dutch newspaper the Financieele Dagblad (fd.nl) says its investigation revealed the Netherlands hosts more than €80 billion in Russian assets.EU sanctions against Russia over its conflict with Ukraine have targeted more than 500 Russian individuals or entities, whose assets and financial resources are subject to seizures as EU countries locate them and trace them to their owners.

And it’s the people of Europe – including French citizens who are set to head to the polls on April 10 and 24 to decide whether Macron deserves a second five-year presidential mandate – who are on the verge of realizing just how much Macron’s kowtowing to the US is going to personally cost them.In February 2019, Foreign Policy magazine claimed that “Macron is going full De Gaulle,” and that, “France’s president is pushing around Britain, Germany, and Italy – and going back to his country’s foreign-policy roots.” If it truly had been the case that Macron was acting like the legendary French president and former World War II era General Charles de Gaulle, then Macron would have stood up to the US as it pushed its NATO allies to arm and train Ukrainian fighters while recklessly and flagrantly ramping up antagonism and belligerence towards Russia.President de Gaulle was so incensed by Washington’s willingness to have France’s armed forces come under US-led NATO collective control that he pulled Paris out of the integrated military command in 1966, at the very height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union that represented the military alliance’s entire raison d’être. De Gaulle shuttled between Moscow and Washington afterwards, armed with the credibility of having rejected strict alignment with either global superpower, and thereby allowing him to act as a truly honest and independent broker on both sides of the Iron Curtain. To further underscore France’s total independence, de Gaulle ratified a foreign affairs, science, and technology cooperation agreement that same year with the Soviet Union, which set France on a divergent course from its Western allies. But in 2009, French President Nicolas Sarkozy reintegrated France into NATO, and Macron has been trying to regain France’s previous reputation as a truly independent broker between Moscow and Washington. He even tried to reorient NATO’s strategic objectives by calling it “brain dead” and emphasizing that it should redefine its focus to counterterrorism missions. Macron has also advocated in favor of the Gaullist position of Europe as an independent world power unto itself.But recent actions speak much louder than Macron’s words. And it didn’t start with the Ukraine conflict. Last year, the Australian government canceled a €50 billion submarine acquisition contract with France, with Washington being the ultimate beneficiary, as President Joe Biden announced that a new China-targeting alliance would include Australia, Britain, and the US, with France excluded despite having significant overseas territories in the region. Despite various French experts suggesting that Macron should have responded to the costly snub by pulling France out of US-led NATO, Macron instead settled for undefined future American help in the Sahel region of Africa. Today, the current value of that US offer is questionable in the wake of France’s withdrawal from Mali. So what net gain did Macron secure for France in exchange for shrugging off Washington’s screw-over of the French economy? Not much.Likewise, in the run-up to the Ukraine conflict, Macron should have known better than to follow along with Washington’s dangerous game. He had every opportunity to adopt an independent stance amid Washington’s arming, training, and supporting of Ukraine and its brazenly anti-Russian stance that had already resulted in sanctioning the Russian-German Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline construction to the detriment of 40% of Europe’s gas supply.As holder of the six-month rotating Council of Europe presidency, Macron sat on his hands and zipped his mouth as the EU attempted to crush Russia with sanctions, blocked Moscow’s foreign reserves, and cut it off from the global banking system. He then stood idly by while the EU quashed media outside of the heavily state-subsidized or corporate-consolidated press, thereby reducing the chance that light would be shined on the potential nefarious consequences for the French people of such actions. Now, with Russia asking Europe to pay for gas in rubles in the wake of the financial difficulties imposed on it by the West, Macron has decided to react. He told Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call this week “that it was not possible for Western gas clients to pay their bills in roubles,” according to Reuters. With Russian gas used in France for everything from industrial production to car fuel, Macron is now in a race against time. Will the French people re-elect him in April before or after they realize how badly Macron’s failure to stand up to America has effectively sanctioned French citizens? Earlier this week, Macron announced a proposal for “food vouchers to help the most modest households and the middle class families to cope with the additional costs” due to sanctions and war-related inflation of food and gas costs.What’s next? Bread lines and rationing? These sanctions clearly don’t benefit the French people, so why did Macron not dial down the belligerence by standing up to Washington when it was cheerleading Ukrainians as proxies for its anti-Russian belligerence? He should have known from the submarine deal screw-over that Washington is always looking out for itself, even if it’s to the detriment of Europe.It’s still not too late for Macron to make his mark on history in the way that de Gaulle did. He could publicly call on the EU to drop all Russian sanctions in light of the harm they are causing his own citizens and industry, and push Ukraine and Russia together to work out their issues while refusing to support or encourage any further NATO belligerence or interference. Doing so would represent a truly courageous and independent stance by Macron in favor of peace, French leadership, and European independence at a time when the world needs it most."

In a statement released Thursday, the Russian Foreign Ministry specified that the blacklist includes representatives of governments and parliaments of some EU member states, EU commissioners and heads of EU military structures, certain public figures and talking heads in the media who have been pushing sanctions and inciting Russophobic attitudes, and ""the vast majority of the members of the European Parliament who promote anti-Russian policies"". ""In trying to portray our country as the culprit of the systemic European security crisis, Brussels' euro-bureaucrats have refused to acknowledge that, over the years, they have condoned the strengthening of Russophobic and neo-Nazi sentiments in Ukraine, the country's militarisation and integration into NATO for the purposes of containing Russia. Notwithstanding our repeated appeals, they have indulged the regime in Kiev in sabotaging the Minsk Agreements and the suffocation of Russian-speaking people in Ukraine. They turned a blind eye to the systematic extermination of civilians in the Donbass,"" the ministry added. The Foreign Ministry indicated that a note outlining the blacklisting has been handed to the office of the EU Delegation in Moscow. ""We reaffirm that any hostile actions on the part of the EU and its member states will inevitably continue to be met with a harsh response,"" it said. The measure follows a similar move by Moscow to put top US officials - including President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others - on a ""stop list"" earlier this month. That move was also taken in retaliation to US sanctions, including the blacklisting of Russian officials, tycoons and their family members. Russia's blacklist on top EU and US officials is expected to have a largely symbolic effect, given that any travel they do to Russia is usually as part of official delegations. However, a separate entry ban on nationals of ""unfriendly"" countries, including the US, the EU and Britain, is expected to have a more serious effect on tourism, business and other ties. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov indicated on Monday that a draft decree on the ""retaliatory visa measures"" was in the works. "

Uranium, which is not currently produced in the US, has not appeared on the sanctions lists.Speaking to parliamentarians and reporters on Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak discussed plans to diversify Russia’s oil exports. Asked to comment on the idea of stopping uranium exports to the US as a potential “counter-sanction” measure, Novak replied that “this matter is also on the agenda, it is being reviewed.”Almost half of the uranium being used by US nuclear power plants has been imported from Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, despite the US having its own significant reserves. US uranium mining sites in Texas and Wyoming, which boomed during the Cold War, have remained mothballed for a number of years. However, recent weeks saw some energy companies expressing readiness to resume production subject to agreement by nuclear power producers to commit to long-term agreements.Speaking about the impact of the sanctions, Novak said that the US and UK embargo on Russian energy resources would not mean big losses for the Russian economy.“This affected us to a lesser extent, because we supplied very little there... As for the United States, we supplied 3% of our total crude oil exports and 7% of our petroleum products,” he explained.When it comes to Europe, in Novak’s opinion, there is no chance that the region would ban Russian energy supplies.“It’s definitely impossible at the moment… The same is true for oil, now it’s impossible to replace Russian oil,” the deputy prime minister said.He added that “in the extreme case,” Russian “would diversify deliveries towards Asian markets.”Meanwhile, according to a Reuters report, EU ministers are set to discuss a ban on Russian oil as part of a fifth package of sanctions.Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

The new sanctions will also reportedly add more names of Russian individuals to EU blacklists.EU foreign and defense ministers are expected to debate the matter on Monday, ahead of the arrival of US President Joe Biden in Brussels on Thursday for talks with NATO’s 30 allies, the EU, and the Group of Seven (G7) including Japan.Last week the EU banned its member-states’ companies from investing in the Russian energy sector but fell short of banning oil and gas imports from the country. The EU gets roughly 40% of its natural gas from Russia, and more than half of the country’s oil exports are destined for Europe.Reuters reports that Baltic countries including Lithuania are pushing for an oil embargo as the next logical step in putting pressure on Moscow, while Germany, the largest EU buyer of Russian crude, is urging caution because energy prices in Europe are already skyrocketing.Another EU nation, Bulgaria, has said it might seek an opt-out, according to Reuters, as the country’s only oil refinery is owned by Russia’s LUKOIL and provides over 60% of the nation’s fuel.Meanwhile, Moscow has warned of ‘serious’ consequences an embargo of Russian oil will have on Europe. Speaking to media on Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said such a ban would “have a serious and negative impact on the energy balance on the European continent.” The US will not be affected as much as the EU, he added, but the people in Europe “will find it really hard. Such a decision will affect everyone,” Peskov said.Russia has indicated that it can sell its energy products elsewhere if its Western buyers pull out. India, the world’s third-largest energy consumer, bought several million barrels of Russian crude last week, to be delivered in May. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) warned last week of an upcoming shock in the world’s oil markets if some buyers shun Russian crude.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

Andy Biggs (R-AZ) Sunday.  No matter which side of the aisle you’re on–or which side of the Atlantic–it was obvious that Joe Biden’s apparent endorsement of regime change in Russia was, at the very least, a strategic mistake. For many, it’s much more: proof of what a number of political analysts and policymakers have long argued, and apparent confirmation of what Niall Ferguson wrote in Bloomberg on Tuesday. The Russian government’s response was swift and unequivocal. Noting that it was “unbecoming for the president of the US to make such statements,” Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov explained Saturday that “it's not up to the president of the U.S. and not up to the Americans to decide who will remain in power in Russia. Only Russians… can decide that.” Even stalwart anti-Russian nations like the United Kingdom seemed to agree with Moscow's assessment. It’s “for the Russian people to decide how they are governed,” UK education secretary Nadhim Zahawi said Sunday. Attempts at damage control from across the pond came just as swiftly. Biden “was not discussing Putin's power in Russia, or regime change,” a White House official insisted Saturday. “We do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia, or anywhere else,” US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken claimed a day later.  While the news that the US doesn’t have a strategy of regime change “anywhere” might come as a surprise to citizens of countries like Iran, Venezuela, and Syria–nations whose governments the US has worked openly to oust for years–even in the US, it was greeted with skepticism.

Two days later, the House of Representatives passed a bill to ban Russian energy imports. The media, which speculated how long it would take for sanctions to turn toward energy carriers, quickly picked up the news, with some Western experts saying the US move could be followed by other countries.However, according to CNN, US Senate sources are now saying it’s unlikely their chamber will move on the bill to turn it into law. The sources explain that the move by the Senate is considered unnecessary after the president took executive action to ban the imports. Also, according to Senator Joe Manchin, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, the House bill is weaker than Biden’s executive action, so the Senate is reluctant to move on the measure.If the Senate does not approve the bill, the import ban won’t turn into law, and US importers can continue buying Russian energy.According to official data, Russia supplied 8% of US imports of crude oil and petroleum products last year. With gasoline prices in the country hitting record highs this month, any disruption could push prices higher.At the same time, the loss of the US market would barely impact Russia’s oil earnings, because the country has much bigger importers across the globe. To be effective, individual country bans would need to be mirrored by a number of states to actually affect the Russian energy export sector. Some analysts say that may be the reason Washington decided to introduce the ban in the first place – as a symbolic gesture to raise pressure on other countries and oil companies to follow suit and cease energy purchases from Russia.However, widely banning supplies from the globe’s second-biggest crude producer would hurt Western countries as much as Russia. Higher oil prices would inevitably lead to higher levels of inflation and be a strain on consumer budgets. And this, in turn, could lower the readiness of voters to support the sanctions policy.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

The finish was the 75th for the prolific Lewandowski in national team colors. Napoli man Zielinski then capitalized on sloppy defending in the 72nd minute when he engineered a one-on-one with Sweden goalkeeper Robin Olsen before calmly slotting home.Poland were indebted to stopper Wojciech Szczesny for some strong saves while Sweden boss Janne Andersson left it until the 79th minute to introduce veteran record goalscorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, by which point a pulsating game had already slipped away.Poland players were jubilant at the final whistle, celebrating on the pitch and donning T-shirts with the message that they were Qatar-bound.Tuesday night’s contest took place after the Poles were handed a bye into the playoff final, avoiding a tie with Russia after they were banned by FIFA in the wake of the military operation in Ukraine.Russia and Poland had been due to meet in Moscow on March 24, with the winners facing the victors from the playoff semifinal between Sweden and the Czech Republic – which the Swedes edged 1-0 in extra-time.But each of Poland, Sweden and the Czech Republic had declared that they would refuse to play Russia before FIFA and UEFA imposed a formal ban on February 28. The Russian Football Union has since unsuccessfully appealed a suspension of the ban with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), paving the way for the playoffs to go ahead without Russia.However, a final CAS verdict on the issue is still pending, with no hearing date being fixed.That has left Russia with a glimmer of hope that the ban can somehow be overturned, although that outcome would seem unlikely given that the playoffs have been completed and any legal victory would require them to be replayed before the World Cup kicks off in Qatar in November.Elsewhere, Ukraine’s World Cup playoff semifinal against Scotland has been postponed until at least June, with the winners of that match meeting Wales for a chance to reach Qatar.In the absence of competitive fixtures during the international break, the Russian team held a training camp in Moscow.Manager Valeri Karpin recently said it would be a “triumph of common sense” if the ban was reversed and his team had the chance to qualify for Qatar.The draw for the World Cup groups takes place in Qatar on Friday, with Poland entering Pot Three of the seedings.  "

Investigators extensively questioned a Biden associate last month, asking about his drug and alcohol use, spending habits and state of mind in 2018, one of these sources said, suggesting prosecutors are studying whether such activity would amount to a defense against a potential criminal tax case. They have also looked into how the payments from Burisma first flowed to Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC before going on to Hunter’s accounts, it added. In April 2014, one of the Biden son’s business partners located in Kazakhstan wired $142,300 to Rosemont Seneca, according to bank statements, the report said. The money came from a Singapore-based company controlled by Kazakh businessman Kenges Rakishev, the report added, citing a document viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The day after receiving the money, Rosemont Seneca sent the same amount to a New Jersey car dealership to purchase a sports car for Hunter Biden, his former associate said. Prosecutors have questioned several ex-associates of Hunter Biden in order to determine whether he moved funds in a way to obscure his tax liability, the report said. They also expressed interest in his business dealings in China. The report comes after new revelations by Western media about Hunter's activity in Ukraine, citing his 2014 leaked correspondence with Pentagon defense contractor Metabiota. The e-mails, believed to have been recovered from his ""laptop from hell"", detail how Hunter Biden leveraged his influence as a board member of Burisma to funnel money into pandemic-causing pathogen research in a country neighbouring Russia.  The reports emerged shortly after the Russian Defence Ministry shed light on Hunter's links to the US-funded biolabs in eastern Ukraine. According to findings by Russia’s Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Troops, one company connected to these biolabs was founded by Hunter Biden and Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former US Secretary of State John Kerry.

Introducing the entity on March 9, the official described it as the “world’s first IT army,” which will include Ukrainians and specialists from other nations.In a radio interview last week, he was more forthcoming about the goals of the operation. He claimed it already included “almost 300,000 people” and said the objectives were to “disrupt the work of [Russian] digital resources” and “fight propaganda” by delivering Kiev’s messages about hostilities in Ukraine to Russian citizens.Bornyakov claimed credit for a range of cyberattacks, from simply defacing web pages to fully disrupting Russian servers. He called those operations retaliation for Russia “attacking us constantly for eight years”.Zakharova compared the ‘IT army’ with Kiev’s creation of ‘legions’ of foreign fighters, with the difference being that hackers don’t have to risk their lives by coming to Ukraine.However, their attacks are far from harmless, including to Western nations, she said. The Russian diplomat claimed that the activists were responsible for the recent attack on the German subsidiary of the Russian oil company Rosneft. The Anonymous hackers claimed they stole 20TB of data from the firm earlier this month. The company had to take its systems offline because of the attack.Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) is investigating the incident.Rosneft pipelines and refineries were not affected, but the attack “created significant risks” for its operations in Germany, Zakharova claimed. That includes the work of the refinery in Schwedt, a major supplier of fuel in eastern Germany, she said. “For some reason, German authorities temporarily forgot about the noble mission of the attackers and had the law enforcement actively look for them,” she remarked.The case exemplifies how Ukraine’s cyberwarfare may have unforeseen consequences for the very nations that support Kiev’s fight against Russia, she added. “Liberal democracies put their stakes on dark forces, be it the Nazis in Ukraine or radical Islamists in the Middle East, and then get targeted themselves,” she said. It’s unlikely that members of Ukraine’s ‘IT army’ “would disband on their own accord and stop their activities, which are criminal in nature.” “This is how you create a cyber ISIS,” she concluded, referring to the notorious terrorist group, which took over vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria in 2014."

Consumer prices are expected to rise globally by approximately 2.5%, the report said.Growth in the European Union will be hardest hit, with a decline of 1.5% in gross domestic product, OECD’s chief economist Laurence Boone told The Globe and Mail. The United States is expected to fare better, with an impact of around 0.8%, she added.Those countries “that have a common border with either Russia or Ukraine” would feel the impact most due to the refugee flows from Ukraine, the OECD said. The price shock, however, might be felt more intensely by those in developing countries.“Well-designed and carefully targeted fiscal support could reduce the negative impact on growth with only a minor extra impetus to inflation,” said the report. It suggested that some governments could provide a one-off windfall tax on energy companies to help households cope with higher bills.The OECD also said that central banks should mostly stick to the interest rate plans set out before the conflict broke out.“Monetary policy should remain focused on ensuring well-anchored inflation expectations,” it said, adding “Most central banks should continue their pre-war plans, with the exception of the most affected economies, where a pause may be needed to fully assess the consequences of the crisis.”For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

The body of the woman was found by advancing Donetsk forces in the basement of Mariupol’s School No. 25. Now used as a forward base by Ukrainian units, it is littered with left-behind uniforms, weapons, and other military equipment.The Donetsk servicemen who spoke to Lancaster allegedly said they assumed the woman was a civilian who had either tried to escape the fighting or had unwarily expressed joy over the gains made by the Russian and Donetsk forces, invoking the fury of Ukrainian nationalists.Footage from the scene suggests the woman had endured brutal torture before her death, her body being marked with multiple bruises and a torn plastic bag visible around her head. She had also had a large swastika carved into her stomach, painted with what appeared to be her own blood.The launch of an investigation into her death comes a day after Moscow announced it was seeking the source of graphic videos purporting to show Ukrainians torturing and executing captured Russian soldiers. The videos, which emerged over the weekend, apparently show militants beating and shooting their prisoners in their legs at point-blank range, with the captured soldiers dying amid their ‘interrogation.’Moscow attacked its neighbor Ukraine last month, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military alliance. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the Donbass by force."

No China? No problem,"" and elsewhere said that ""few will miss them"" regarding the Russian absence.Reacting to such remarks, 2006 Turin Winter Olympics champion Navka said she believes Western journalists deliberately speak about Russian figure skaters in unflattering terms.""Those words say everything,"" Navka told Sport-Express.""The task of the Americans is to destroy Russia and China. A strong person would never say that.""It's sport. It seems to me that with this statement she insulted herself and her entire country,” added the 46-year-old, who is a married to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. A post shared by Tatiana Navka (@tatiana_navka)Navka's comment is not the first address that respected figures in Russian skating have made to western reporters.On Thursday, legendary coach Tatiana Tarasova barked back at former Globe and Mail journalist from Canada Beverley Smith, who tweeted: ""There were no triple Axels to be seen, but what a sane women's event this was, compared to the crazy drama at the Olympics,"" in an apparent nod to Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva's doping row at the Beijing Winter Games.A failed test result from December showed traces of a drug used to treat angina, but only emerged once Valieva had already helped the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) to gold in the team event in China. ""Sigh of relief: no Russian skaters or judges. Love it. It wasn't the skating or sport world that really made this happen: it was the war in Ukraine,"" Smith crowed. Answering Smith through Sport-Express, Tarasova fired back: ""I want to upset Beverley: we will only be gone a year, and we will return with even greater strength.""The World Figure Skating Championships will conclude on Sunday in Montpellier.Absent top-level Russian performers including Valieva and Shcherbakova will alternatively take part in the Channel One Cup on domestic soil in Saransk, which kicks off on Friday.  "

Another strike targeted a Ukrainian Special Operations Forces training center in the northern Zhytomyr region, where more than 100 Ukrainian troops and foreign fighters were killed.Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

34ae6995-95c8-4f08-aeba-61d8de1910cc,https://www.rt.com/news/552564-ukraine-conflict-african-nations-consequences/,How the Ukraine conflict could affect African nations,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.03/xxs/623b350920302729d7277be2.jpg,"In the ongoing standoff between the West and the East, the continent has a vested interest in remaining neutral","Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, launched in February, followed by the dramatic increase in tensions on the global scene will undoubtedly affect the economic and political landscape in Africa in the medium term, as well as the balance of external powers active on the continent and Africa’s pace of development in key areas.Diplomatically, Africa has chosen to remain neutral on the subject of the conflict, alongside a large portion of the Global South nations. 26 out of 54 African states did not support the UN General Assembly’s resolution to condemn Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Eritrea voted against it, while 17 other African countries (out of 35 globally) abstained from the vote. These include Algeria, Angola, Burundi, Zimbabwe, Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, South Africa and South Sudan. Eight more nations did not vote: Burkina Faso, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Eswatini and Ethiopia. Egypt, despite voicing its support of the resolution, is maintaining constructive cooperation with Russia anyway. No country on the African continent has so far joined the sanctions.Notably, both Senegal and Tanzania, continental economic leaders of the last decade, did not join its traditional trade and business partners to condemn Russia. Of no less significance is the statement that came from South African President Cyril Ramaphosa who said in parliament that “the war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region.”Since the launch of the special operation in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has held telephone talks with three African leaders: with President of Senegal Macky Sall (who is also the Chair of the African Union until February 2023), President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa.So far, according to the official statements, the situation has not changed any plans for the Second Russia–Africa Summit - set to be held later this year. On March 3, Presidential Special Envoy for Africa and Middle East Mikhail Bogdanov told the Russian News Agency TASS that “preparations are underway” and “the dates for the summit are yet to be announced.”In the meantime, the military conflict, sanctions and economic measures introduced by the Russian government to stabilize the domestic market will no doubt have a significant effect on the African economies.Between 2015 and 2020, Russia and Ukraine supplied up to 25% of the total wheat imports into Africa.A series of consequences have hit the sector, including a potential temporary ban on wheat exports, disruption to the sowing season in Ukraine, delays with shipments via the Black Sea routes and a looming fertilizer crisis that might affect other key suppliers of wheat to Africa, such as France and Brazil. These issues pose a serious food security threat to a number of African nations, including Egypt, Algeria, Sudan and Tanzania.At the same time, supply disruptions will affect African countries in different ways. For example, in Nigeria this problem can be solved relatively painlessly: wheat is a commodity with a flexible demand in the country, occupying a market share that’s comparable with other crops, such as corn and cassava.In other areas, however, the situation not only threatens demand, but also challenges a number of business projects, such as large-scale investments in wheat and other crop storage infrastructure network, as some of these investment projects involve Russian businesses and funding.Another persistent problem is caused by the shortage of logistics corridors due to sanctions and restrictions. Currently, Russia is unable to run massive grain and fertilizer supplies via the Caspian Sea and Iran.A sector where Africa is also bound to feel the change is the energy market. On the one hand, Europe shunning Russian oil and gas leaves African nations such as Algeria, Libya, and Nigeria with an opportunity to step in and fill in the gap in the hydrocarbons exports. On the other hand, this opportunity, so far, seems to be strictly hypothetical since none of these nations have the capacity to take advantage of the opportunity within the next five years.Nigeria, for instance, lacks the capacity for free exports, while other nations, such as Algeria, Libya and to a lesser extent Egypt, might not have too much surplus natural gas and crude oil to sell. Another problem in this area that will have to be dealt with is the rising oil prices triggering the growth of oil product prices. Oil products are mostly imported by African nations, and this crisis is going to hit the nations that rely on imported diesel and residual fuel oil the hardest, such as West Africa.If the euro zone is engulfed by a crisis, a massive outflow of capital and a persistent economic confrontation with Russia might mean to Africa less economic and tech support from the EU and its member states.The future of infrastructure investment projects announced at the EU–African Union Summit in February as part of the ambitious Global Gateway Investment Package is also questionable. In the medium term, the social and economic situation in West Africa is causing the biggest concern. This region has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic harder than others, and a new crisis hitting its food and energy security might further destabilize the regional political systems.The global crisis, once again, confirms Africa's critical dependence on events not directly related to it. The risk of such destabilization can be countered by investing in the localization of the production of the main commodity categories that are critical for the continental economy: fertilizers, oil products, and food.In the developing stand-off between the West and the East, Africa will try to remain ‘above the battle,’ metaphorically speaking. It most probably won’t have to step up its budget spending on defense. To achieve that, it just needs to make sure the US-Russia-China confrontation steers clear of the African Continent and to try to maintain its neutral status, remaining united in the process – which is currently an issue, as the recent UN vote has shown."

How will the NYT report pan out for Joe Biden and the Democratic administration?","""This story underscores that the American MSM, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter were deliberately collaborating with the American deep state and the Democratic Party to secure the 2020 Presidential Election for Joe Biden"", says former US Senate candidate and investigative journalist Mark Dankof. This ""'fix-is-in"" suppression of the story, originally discovered by the New York Post in October 2020, is nothing new, notes the journalist. The same ""fix-is-in"" approach was also adopted by the previous US administrations of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama and included the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999; the 2003 invasion of Iraq under a completely false pretext; the ""criminal use of NATO"" in Libya and ""the accompanying extra-judicial assassination"" of Muammar Gaddafi; the support of Islamists in Syria to oust President Bashar al-Assad; the US-backed coup d'etat in February 2014 in Kiev; and then-Vice President Joe Biden's role in firing the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma, according to Dankof. The former Senate candidate notes that much in the same vein, the US mainstream media and American politicians remain tight-lipped about Russia’s legitimate national security concerns which are driving the nation's special operation in Ukraine. Similarly, the existence of American biolabs in Ukraine had been ridiculed as a ""conspiracy theory"" by the US MSM - until Victoria Nuland at least partially confirmed their existence - while Volodymyr Zelensky's threats to nix Ukraine's non-nuclear status were completely overlooked, according to Dankof. Even though most of the US mainstream media has ignored the NYT's latest piece addressing the ongoing federal investigation into Hunter Biden and his laptop, it may add to Joe Biden's already poor approval ratings, according to Dankof. Although some pollsters note that Joe Biden's rating improved after his State of Union address, in which he castigated Russia over the Ukraine special operation, FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker indicates that in the last two weeks or so, the president's approval rating has only ticked up from 41.1 percent to 42.9 percent. Given Biden's plummeting ratings and the Democratic Party's inability to push through its initiatives, the GOP is expected to make major gains in the 2022 midterms, according to observers. If the Republican Party ""doesn’t regain control of Capitol Hill with the catastrophic performance of Biden in the aftermath of a rigged Presidential Election in 2020, it ought to hang it up"", Dankof says. Hunter Biden's laptop story originates in the New York Post's October 2020 bombshell article that exposed alleged corruption by the former vice president's son and apparent involvement of Joe Biden in Hunter's business deals. For his part, Joe Biden vehemently denied that he had the slightest knowledge about his son's work and financial gains. The laptop in question, containing a trove of potentially damning documents, was reportedly abandoned by Hunter Biden at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. However, the laptop story was ditched by Big Media and Big Tech amid the 2020 presidential cycle. GOP lawmakers subjected Silicon Valley giants to criticism over suppressing the Hunter laptop story following the NYT's admission that emails extracted from the laptop had been ""verified."" Republican Representative Claudia Tenney told the New York Post on 19 March that Congress must ""rein in Big Tech censors"". For his part, Republican Senator Ted Cruz highlighted that ""Big Tech leaders who participated in censoring the truth should answer to Congress and the American people in sworn testimony"". Meanwhile, some lawyers familiar with the Hunter Biden case do not rule out that the president's son could be indicted. “I expect him to be indicted”, said attorney Clint Lancaster, as quoted by National Review. “Just based on what I saw in his financial records, I would be surprised if he’s not indicted”. E. Michael Jones holds a different stance: he believes that the Hunter Biden scandal will remain swept under the rug and that the Bidens will be allowed to get away with this. ""The Clinton family has never been held accountable for their crimes. Justice, as Thrasymachus said in Plato's Republic, is the opinion of the powerful"", Jones stresses. "

At around noon, radars detected the aircraft moving through eastern Hungarian airspace towards Slovakia, which borders Hungary in the north.The jets patrolled the area and ensured that there was no threat before returning to the Kecskemet Air Base in central Bacs-Kiskun County, the military said. The identity of the aircraft was not revealed to the public.News agency MTI noted that it was the third time in as many days that the Hungarian military scrambled fighter jets. In the two previous cases on Saturday and Monday, warplanes took to the air as a precaution after reports of bombs on civilian airliners flying through Hungarian and Polish airspace.Another incident occurred in Eastern Europe earlier in March when an old Soviet Tu-141 drone flew all the way from Ukraine over Romania and Hungary to Croatia before crashing in a park in Zagreb.Luckily, no one was hurt in the incident, but Croatian officials acknowledged that it exposed a major flaw in the defensive capabilities of the nation. The aircraft, which was widely presumed to be Ukrainian, spent around 40 minutes in Hungarian airspace.In a separate incident in Romania last week, a small reconnaissance drone was found, which appeared to be a short-range model used by Russian forces. The country’s defense minister dismissed it as insignificant."

The move is aimed at stopping Russia from evading existing sanctions, the statement said.“Our purpose here is to methodically remove the benefits and privileges Russia once enjoyed as a participant in the international economic order,” an unnamed senior administration official was quoted as saying by Reuters.The United States and its allies have already imposed several rounds of sanctions, including targeting the country’s largest lenders and foreign reserves. The new restrictions could deter international banks from buying or lending against Russia’s reserves.Russia holds roughly $130 billion in gold reserves, the world’s fifth-biggest stockpile. The country ramped up gold purchasing in 2014, following the initial US sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. Moscow has more than doubled its holdings since then. For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

As supplies of sunflower oil have been disrupted from the most prominent producer, Ukraine, Indian dealers are mulling options to ease the shortage of edible oils in the country.","India has started replacing Ukrainian sunflower oil with Russia, as dealers have contracted at least 45,000 tonnes for April delivery. India's edible oil players, such as Gemini Edibles &amp; Fats India, have received letters of credit from Indian banks.  This is the first order since Moscow began its special military operation in Ukraine to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-Nazify"" the Eastern European country. The delivery will ease the supply constraint in the domestic market, which has recently seen a sharp surge in edible oil prices. The executive director of the premier vegetable oil industry association said that the shortfall would be met by increasing imports from Russia. ""We expect more supply as two ports of Russia are still operating. Government is very keen to resolve the payment mechanism, and we hope it will be sorted out soon whether it would be in rupee or rupee-ruble mechanism; let's wait"", Mehta added. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is expected to arrive in New Delhi in the first week of April to discuss a range of bilateral issues, including finalising a payment system to continue trade. In February, about 152,000 tonnes of sunflower oil arrived in India. A similar quantity is likely to come in March, as vessels that left before the military operation will arrive at Indian ports this month. However, Mehta of the Solvent Extractors' Association of India said that the current landing cost of sunflower oil is around $2,100 per ton compared to approximately $1,600 per ton a month ago. ""At this landing cost, sunflower oil will be available for Indian consumers at INR 200-250 per litre. We do not think the demand will sustain at this high price"", Mehta added. India paid over $20 billion in import bills in 2021-22 for only 13 million tonnes of edible oil. It is worth noting that in 2019-20, India's imports of edible oils were close to 15 million tonnes, valued at less than $10 billion. "

357bb990-2d93-4eb5-8af3-220f56c25eb3,https://www.rt.com/news/552494-scotland-professor-ukraine-theater/,Professor faces government crackdown for questioning Ukraine narrative,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.03/xxs/623a05f6203027347a2379a2.jpg,A Scottish professor was slammed for sharing an article claiming the Mariupol theater bombing was “staged”,"University of Edinburgh professor Tim Hayward is being hammered in the media for sharing an article suggesting the bombing of a theater in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol may have been staged by Ukrainian nationalists. Hayward’s skepticism has already led Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi to promise a “crackdown” on such wrongthink.Hayward shared an article on Sunday from the Grayzone, a left-wing news outlet. Citing eyewitnesses in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the article claims that Ukrainian ‘Azov’ fighters – once described by western outlets and lawmakers as “neo-Nazis” – sheltered behind civilians in a theater in Mariupol, before blowing the building up as Russian forces entered the Ukrainian city.Azov forces and journalists linked to the extremist unit accused Russia of bombing the building, and used the incident to call for western intervention against Russia. US President Joe Biden declared Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal” in response, and American politicians from both parties and from Europe renewed their calls for military aid – including fighter jets – for Ukraine.However, no video exists showing the theater being bombed and Russia denies attacking the building, stating that it had “never been considered as a strike target.” Conflicting reports of the weapons supposedly used and the civilian casualties or lack thereof only muddy the picture further.Yet Hayward was condemned by his colleagues for raising the issue. In a Times article on Tuesday accusing him of “spreading propaganda,” Dr. Aliaksandr Herasimenka, a ‘misinformation’ researcher at Oxford University, said that “we must be very careful” when reading reports critical of the official narrative in Ukraine, and that outlets like the Grayzone “are currently engaged in a massive disinformation campaign.” He did not provide any evidence that would support such allegations against the media outlet.Hayward has been singled out by the Scottish government too. Having shared articles questioning the alleged bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol and claiming that Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad did not gas his own citizens as Western sources insist, the professor was accused in Westminster last week by Tory MP Robert Halfon as being a “useful idiot for President Putin’s atrocities.”Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said that academics like Hayward were already being investigated, and that their universities would be contacted.“Putin and his cronies are a malign influence on anyone in this country buying their false narrative, and I have to repeat it is a false and dangerous narrative, and we will crack down on it hard,” Zahawi said, without elaborating on how.Speaking to Edinburgh Live, Hayward said that he is concerned about restrictions to free speech, and considers hearing both points of view important in wartime.""In war, miscalculations can have terrible consequences. We also know that misinformation can sometimes even slip through on our own side, as when the UK went to war in Iraq, mistakenly believing it had weapons of mass destruction,” he said. ""As for the people of Ukraine, their need is for peace – not to become the epicenter of World War III,” he added, referring to the widely-held belief that were Western powers to intervene in Ukraine, the consequence would be a third world war."

The show was produced by RT, formerly Russia Today, but Hedges maintained editorial control.","No explanation, forewarning or notice was given by YouTube, the videos simply disappeared, according to Hedges, who wrote about the experience on ScheerPost in an article titled “On Being Disappeared.” On Contact contained interviews with a wide range of individuals. From social commentators like Noam Chomsky and Cornel West, novelist Russell Banks, journalists Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi and human rights lawyer Steven Donziger, among many others, the show provided a platform for many different voices. RT America (formerly Russia Today America) is funded by the Russian government, not unlike Sputnik News. RT was dropped from American cable networks and YouTube after Russia’s special operation in Ukraine. The EU and the UK also banned RT and in the case of the EU, Sputnik News. The justification for Russian media’s disappearance in the West was over allegations of “Russian disinformation” being spread, particularly as it pertains to the situation in Ukraine. With the removal of On Contact, the justification has seemingly been expanded to include not just Ukraine but any information with even a tenuous connection to Russia. On Contact did not discuss the situation in Ukraine, its primary focus was on the multitude of issues facing the West. Hedges, the former New York Times journalist and creator of On Contact, explains. Hedges’ channel is not the only one to be censored as US tech giants look to appease their government’s foreign policy objectives. As he mentions, Progressive Soapbox was recently demonetized and Status Coup was suspended for airing footage of the January 6 riots, something nearly every mainstream outlet also aired. As OpIndia points out, the Indian news channel WION was suspended for airing parts of a speech by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. WION claims Western outlets also covered the speech but were not de-platformed. YouTube, as a private entity, can choose what it allows on its platform. However, YouTube’s dominance of its marketplace essentially makes it the video platform of record on the internet. If a video is not on YouTube, it might as well not exist. Its biggest direct competitors are Dailymotion and Vimeo, which have a fraction of YouTube’s audience. Congress has recently begun pressuring social media platforms to combat ‘disinformation.’ With the massive scope of large tech companies, corporate censorship is almost as impactful as government censorship.

The unions denounced the plan, scheduled to be approved March 29, in a joint statement, pointing out that it “doesn’t specify what it will comprise, how it will work, and, more importantly, how much aid each trucker would get.” Drivers loosely allied under the banner of the Platform stopped work last Monday, faced with a surge in diesel prices, demanding the government lower taxes and roll back regulations. “Until we negotiate the real problems faced by small truck drivers, there will be no suspension [of the strike],” Platform president Manuel Hernandez told Reuters on Monday, saying drivers must be protected from taking on losses or else they faced “total bankruptcy”.Finance Minister Nadia Calvino, however, told reporters that the truckers should not reject the offer and that those who would “are clearly showing they do not defend the interests of this sector.”The government’s plan was offered up following a European Commission meeting on a draft proposal for temporary crisis aid aimed at propping up the continent’s ailing economy as inflation and fuel prices soar, in part due to the sanctions imposed on Russia in the wake of its ongoing military offensive in Ukraine.While the EU receives more than 40% of its natural gas supply from Russia, the alliance is reportedly considering an embargo on oil from the country as part of the latest round of sanctions aimed at economically crippling the country. More than half of Russia’s oil exports are sent to Europe. However, several European countries, including Germany and Bulgaria, have suggested a total ban on Russian fuel is a bridge too far. Madrid has dismissed the truckers, branding them as unorganized and attempting to link them to far-right extremists. Spain has mobilized a reported 23,000 police in an effort to crush the strike."

According to the ministry, the Russian military used high-precision weapons to eliminate the nationalist base there on 21 March. The Defence Ministry's spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that the location of the Ukrainian MLRS base was received by intelligence from several sources. The spokesman noted that this is just more proof of criminal actions by the regime in Kiev, which has been using civilian objects in densely populated areas to deploy artillery and MLRS batteries. Earlier, videos emerged on social media allegedly showing Ukrainian artillery moving in the vicinity of the Retroville shopping mall in Kiev and a Grad MLRS (NATO reporting name M1964) firing rockets from what looked like a parking lot at the same mall. Retroville suffered massive damage from the strike conducted overnight on 21 March. The Russian Defence Ministry has repeatedly condemned the tactic of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and nationalist battalions to deploy artillery and MLRS batteries in densely populated areas in apparent attempts to draw Russian fire onto civilians and blame Moscow for the casualties later. At the same time, the ministry stressed that it would only target military infrastructure during the special operation in Ukraine, which was launched on 24 February. "

The alleged discovery was announced by Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov during a media briefing on Saturday.Washington and many other Western states moved their embassy staff to Lvov shortly before Russia launched its military attack last month. The city, regarded as a hotbed of Ukrainian nationalism, is about 500km (300 miles) west of the capital, Kiev, and just 50km (30 miles) from the Polish border.   The information on the supposed plot was provided by an officer from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), whom Moscow says voluntarily surrendered to Russian forces. “The officer was directly involved in the organizing and training of sabotage and terrorist groups to work in areas liberated from the nationalists,” Konashenkov stated, adding that the individual had given the Russian military a list of SBU agents involved in such activities. “I’d like to stress that the Kiev regime is fully aware of the plans harbored by the nationalists, but is doing nothing to prevent them,” he added.The ultimate goal of the alleged attacks is to blame Moscow for them, using the incidents as leverage to push the NATO countries into providing more weaponry and establishing a long-demanded no-fly zone over the country, Konashenkov claimed.Moscow launched a large-scale offensive against its neighboring country last month, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to regularize the status of the breakaway regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the NATO military bloc. Kiev says the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two rebel republics by force."

I was expressing moral outrage that I feel, and I make no apologies for it.”Asked if his remarks complicated the diplomacy about ending the war, Biden said no, arguing that Putin’s “escalatory efforts” were what “complicates things a great deal, but I don't think it complicates it at all.”Reporter: ""Do you believe what you said that Putin cannot remain in power.""Biden: ""I'm not walking anything back."" pic.twitter.com/BcHk3g5x3yIn response to another question about what he had meant in Warsaw, Biden said that “people like this shouldn't be ruling countries,” again referring to Putin.Another reporter reminded Biden of his extensive foreign policy experience – he sat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for years – and asked if he could see how his words could be interpreted as a policy statement, or used as propaganda by Russia.“No and no,” Biden replied. “Because it’s ridiculous. Nobody believes… I was talking about taking down Putin. Nobody believes that.”BIDEN: ""Nobody believes we're gonna takedown... I was talking about taking down Putin."" pic.twitter.com/9Ig4HvcaanBiden even insisted he never told US troops in Poland they were going to Ukraine when he said “when you get there, you’ll see,” or that the US would “respond in kind” to a hypothetical chemical attack by Russia, or that he called for regime change in Russia.“None of the three occurred,” he told Fox News’ Peter Doocy. “You interpret the language that way.” The US president said he was talking to the troops about “helping train the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland.” Doocy: ""The big things you say on the world stage keep getting walked back.""Biden: ""What's getting walked backed?""Biden: You told troops they are going to Ukraine, the U.S. would use a chemical weapon, and called for regime change in Russia.Biden: ""None of the 3 occurred."" pic.twitter.com/cwZPzANIoCAs for the chemical weapons remarks, Biden shrugged it off.“I’m not going to tell you. Why would I tell you? You’ve got to be silly,” he told the reporter, whom he called a “stupid son of a b**ch” back in January. When Doocy said the world wants to know, Biden smiled and said “the world wants to know a lot of things.”On Saturday, White House aides hastened to “clarify” Biden’s remarks in Warsaw, telling reporters that whatever the president had said, what he meant was that Putin can’t be allowed to “exercise power over neighboring countries.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken went a step further on Sunday, saying that “we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia – or anywhere else, for that matter.” By Monday morning, however, the official talking point was that Biden was just expressing a personal opinion. “I think that speech that you saw was a reflection of his emotional connection to this issue and commitment to European security, to NATO and to Ukraine,” White House Energy Security Coordinator Amos Hochstein told the Dubai Global Energy Forum. “I think it was a very emotional, very personal view,” he added, saying that in his opinion Biden “was not indicating a change of US policy and regime change.”"

Wrapping up his European tour, Biden said during a Saturday speech on Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"", and called him a ""butcher"", trigerring a backlash in Moscow. At the same time, French President Macron said he would not have used such words, as it may result in an escalation with Moscow, while some American politicians slammed the rhetoric. US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, later noted that Biden's remarks about Putin were not endorsing a regime change in Russia, and the US president himself walked back his statement. The contraversial speech was dedicated to the situation in Ukraine, where Russia has launched a special military operation. President Vladimir Putin ordered the op on 24 February in response to a request from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) to defend them against shelling by Ukrainian forces. Putin stated that the goals of the operation are the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine. "

""Here, when we see this sanctions free-for-all, it is of course clear that all of these values that our Western colleagues had constantly preached to us about the freedom of expression, a market economy, the inviolability of private property and the presumption of innocence, all of these values are worthless,"" Lavrov said in a separate engagement with reporters Friday after meeting with Abkhazian President Aslan Bzhania. The diplomat said most countries outside the collective West don't want to ""engage in a one-sided game"" amid the current crisis, notwithstanding ""enormous pressure"" and ""propaganda juggling the numbers of votes cast for provocative UN resolutions"". Lavrov expressed confidence that most countries in the world will not join the West's sanctions games. ""The vast majority of countries in the world are interested in developing equitable cooperation based on the key principles laid down in the UN Charter, first and foremost - the principle of the sovereign equality of states,"" he said. The Russian diplomat also suggested that efforts by the West to ""rudely trample"" over these principles to try to ""impose its superiority"" are ""doomed to failure"", as even the history of Europe has shown. Commenting on the crisis in Ukraine and Western powers' reaction to the situation, Lavrov recalled US and European media's ""hushing"" up of the killings of civilians and the economic blockade of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics by Ukrainian forces for nearly eight years. He also pointed to US and European work to pump Ukraine up with weaponry, and efforts to encourage Kiev to ""resolve"" the Donbass crisis by force. The current situation in the world has been ""heated up to the limit,"" according to Lavrov. ""In fact, we are witnessing the culmination of the policy of containment of Russia, which the West has pursued for a long time."" The ""apogee of this Russophobic line was Washington and Brussels' support for the regime in Kiev,"" he said. ""It's worth remembering the laws that have been consistently adopted in Ukraine [after the 2014 Maidan coup] regarding the Russian language, or rather, regarding the ban on the use of the Russian language in education, in the media, and in everyday life, and thereby, in effect, uprooting from Ukraine all of its Russian roots and crossing out the common history of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples,"" Lavrov said. ""The desire by the West to maintain its dominance in international affairs, to subjugate everything and everyone and return to a unipolar world - these are, of course, illusions,"" Lavrov said. Efforts by the West to maintain its hegemony ""by hook or by crook, but rather by crook,"" are the cause of ""serious tension in international relations,"" according to Lavrov, and can only be counteracted ""together with our partners and allies."" The foreign minister stressed that despite the best efforts of Western powers, there can be no talk of Russia's isolation on the world stage. ""We are not going to isolate ourselves. We have many friends, allies and partners in the world, a huge number of associations in which Russia works with countries in every continent, and will continue to do so,"" he said. "

They talk about how Biden is expected to ask Xi to use his influence to press Russia to end the war. The White House on the other hand is flooding Ukraine with large and small arms which are sure to prolong the conflict. Part of this message will certainly be to press China not to provide Russia with military aid. Next, Dan Kovalik, labor attorney, human rights activist and author. His latest book is called Cancel This Book: The Progressive Case Against Cancel Culture joins the conversation. Kovalik and the Misfits talk about a judge in Scotland last year who made a very bold statement that was just made public yesterday. The judge refused to extradite a British prisoner to the state of Texas solely because of poor prison conditions which  constituted an international violation of human rights. The case began when a Scottish national, Daniel McGee, shot a security guard in Austin and fled to Scotland. He was quickly caught and held pending extradition. But that won’t happen now. Then, Jim Kavanagh, the editor of thepolemicist.net joins the conversation to talk about the Justice Department admitting to a federal judge that it had lost one of the January 6 defendants in jail. He somehow got lost in the system and because he was denied his day in court the feds must drop the charges against him. The prosecutor argued that they should be allowed to refile the charges. Attorneys ended up getting the defendant to plead guilty to assaulting a police officer as quickly as possible before the government could add different charges. And, they talk about the NYT report that Hunter Biden’s laptop does in fact exist.

On her Instagram Stories on Friday, she posted a photo where someone is standing on the Russian national flag.This came to the attention of Russian swimmers such as six-time Youth Olympics gold medalist Kliment Kolesnikov, European Aquatics Championships gold medalist Vladislav Grinev and recent Beijing 2020 athlete Maxim Stupin, who was a teammate of Gunes' at Energy Standard before Russian athletes were banned from international competitions as a response to Russia's military operation in Ukraine. Kolesnikov, who was also on Energy Standard, shared the Stories post and added two question marks either side of an emoji of a man throwing his hands up in confusion.But Stupin and Grinev were far more vocal, and left the same message which asked: ""Where are the boundaries of the permitted behavior of athletes?""A post shared by Viktoria Zeynep Gunes (@viktoriagunes)""If you decide that it is humane to remove Russian athletes from participation in international competitions, then take action here as well. Nationalism is UNACCEPTABLE in any form,"" they said, while, like Kolesnikov, tagging a number of bodies such as FINA, the European Swimming Federation (LEN), the International Swimming League (ISL) plus Team Energy.FINA has been busy this week regarding Russian swimmers after finally announcing a ban on their participation in international events much later than other sporting federations.The body also opened an investigation into Tokyo 2020 double gold medalist Evgeny Rylov, who is suspected of potentially violating their rules due to ""alleged participation"" in a Moscow concert that celebrated the reunification of Crimea with Russia and was held under a 'For a World Without Nazism' banner.""The FINA Executive has requested that the panel’s proceedings be expedited,"" the governing body added in a statement that announced the blanket ban, though the Russian Swimming Federation claim that their correspondence from FINA was incorrectly worded and that ""the possibility of participating in other events is theoretically preserved"".""FINA will now consider each specific case for the participation of Russians,"" Vladimir Salnikov explained to Match TV about participation in events beyond the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest this summer.But Rylov, who has also lost his Speedo sponsorship, had already ruled himself out of the competition before FINA's announcement in protest against Russian athletes being barred from the Paralympic Games in Beijing earlier in March.""I believe that by losing competition, the development of sports is lost.

US forces in the Mediterranean operate under the Sixth Fleet – headquartered in Naples, Italy, and have a combined strength of up to 40 ships and 175 aircraft.","The USS Truman carrier strike group has been deployed to the Mediterranean, with Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro saying its mission includes “deterring” Russia and implementing a potential no-fly zone over Ukraine, should President Biden give the order to establish one. “There are numerous Russian ships and subs in the Mediterranean today and that’s why it’s important for NATO to have an equal presence, to deter them. The only thing that Putin understands is strength”, Del Toro said, speaking to Politico. The Nimitz-class carrier and its escorts are currently stationed in the Ionian Sea, the body of water directly southeast of the Italian ""boot"" and the western coast of Greece. Its aircraft are said to have carried out over 75 patrol missions along NATO’s eastern flank, including near the Ukrainian border, over the past month. The Truman has been used repeatedly in US wars of aggression, with its aircraft flying over 1,200 combat sorties during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and assisting coalition forces during fighting against the Taliban* insurgency in Afghanistan in the 2010s. The current tensions between Russia and NATO over Ukraine aren’t the first time the US has deployed a carrier strike group in the Med as a show of force against Moscow. In the spring of 2014, in the wake of the victory of the US and EU-backed Maidan coup in Kiev and tensions between Russia and NATO over the fate of Crimea, Washington deployed another Nimitz-class carrier, the George H.W. Bush, near the peninsula off southern Turkey. A growing number of US lawmakers has called for the introduction of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, notwithstanding the danger of provoking a direct military confrontation with Russia. The US and its allies have experience implementing no-fly zones over mostly small and militarily overmatched countries, including Iraq, Bosnia, and Libya. Between 1991 and 2011, NATO used no-fly zones against these countries not only to stop the operation of aircraft over designated areas, but to themselves engage in the bombing of ground targets. In Iraq, authorities estimate that up to 1,400 civilians were killed in US and UK-enforced no-fly zones between 1991 and 2003. In Bosnia between 1993 and 1995, NATO jets bombed civilian infrastructure and killed over 150 civilians, and polluted the country with cancer-causing depleted uranium shells. The no-fly zone instituted over Libya in 2011 played a crucial role in overthrowing the Gaddafi government and turning the country into a failed state with open-air slave markets. * The Taliban are a group under United Nations sanctions for terrorist activities.

Addressing the leaders of NATO member states via video link on Thursday, Zelensky said he had not received a “clear answer” to the request of “one percent of all your tanks.”NATO and the US similarly refused to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine, or to supply Kiev with Soviet-era warplanes, fearing it could spark direct conflict with Russia. The bloc, nevertheless, reaffirmed its support for Ukraine, while countries like the UK and Sweden promised to send additional anti-tank weapons. US President Joe Biden said on Thursday that “our weapons are flowing into Ukraine as I speak.”Reuters reported on Thursday that the White House began consultations on delivering anti-ship missiles to Ukraine. “There may be some technical challenges with making that happen but that is something that we are consulting with allies and starting to work on,” an official source told Reuters.The report came the same day the Ukrainian General Staff claimed that a Russian landing ship was destroyed at the Azov Sea port of Berdyansk, while two other vessels were damaged. Ukrainian officials earlier accused Russian warships of firing at Odessa, a Black Sea port. Russia has not commented on either of these statements.Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and Russia’s official recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocol had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO, while Kiev says the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked, denying claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

So far, it has declined to go along, even refusing to vote to condemn the attack at the United Nations.India has a long history of close economic and social ties with Russia, dating back to the Soviet-era. New Delhi is also wary of the consequences of Moscow getting closer to China, and how that could affect the balance of power in Asia.This may help explain why the Indian side agreed to purchase Russian oil at a discount earlier this month, an popular move in the West. Though officials have called for an end to the fighting in Ukraine and urged for a peaceful resolution of the conflict, the country has not budged on demands to take harsher action against Russia.UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will also visit the country on Thursday, where she plans to discuss “bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest” with Indian FM Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. She has previously called for a “closer economic and defense relationship” with India, which she claimed has “some level of dependence on Russia.”Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is also set to meet with his Indian counterpart later this month following a two-day stop in China, according to the Hindustan Times. Like India, Beijing has also taken a neutral stance on the war in Ukraine, declining to condemn Russia while calling on both sides to stop fighting.US President Joe Biden has stated that New Delhi has been “somewhat shaky” in its response to Russia – instead praising the “extremely strong” reactions of other allies such as Japan and Australia – while UK Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said London is “very disappointed” by India’s unwillingness to impose sanctions. India has championed a policy of neutrality since gaining independence in 1947, maintaining ties with both the Soviet Union and the West throughout the Cold War and maintaining friendly relations with Moscow since. India has a particularly close partnership with Russia in the military sphere, as its top weapons customer, athough it also regularly cooperates with the US and other Western nations in joint military drills."

That’s when the Slovenian flag, according to the chargé d’affaires, started to resemble the Russian flag.Soon afterwards, members of the Ukrainian National Guard went to the diplomat and asked if the embassy could “temporarily remove the Slovenian flag because it is too similar to the Russian one,” after which it was taken down.Earlier, Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa announced that Ljubljana will return its diplomats to Kiev after they left in late February due to Russia’s military operation in the country. “Ukraine needs direct diplomatic support to end the aggression and establish peace as soon as possible,” the Slovenian leader said.On March 15, Jansa, along with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala, supposedly visited the capital of the war-torn nation to express their support. Following the visit, the Slovenian leader insisted that Ukraine should become a member of the EU as soon as possible.“We are trying to convince our colleagues within the European Council that these are abnormal times, that there is a war going on, that people are dying and that we need to speed up the process of Ukraine’s membership in the EU. The vast majority of EU countries support Ukraine’s European path,” Jansa tweeted.Ljubljana has not responded to Kiev’s violation of the diplomatic protocol. Adopted in 1961, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations states that a foreign embassy should be allowed to display its national flag.“The mission and its head shall have the right to use the flag and emblem of the sending State on the premises of the mission, including the residence of the head of the mission, and on his means of transport.”"

Disruptions in banking services appear to be a common issue for France-based Russians and Belarusians, according to a petition started earlier in the day and signed by over 1,300 affected people at the time of writing. The petition specified that Russian-speaking clients cannot at the moment transfer money between their accounts, receive their French salary or scholarship on their cards. Some were left with practically nothing. The authors stressed that in accordance with the EU Council Regulation 2022/328 of 25 February 2022, Article 5b, paragraph 2, they do not fall under sanctions and therefore consider such actions ""arbitrary and discriminatory."" French bank Societe General told Sputnik that the financial institution strictly observes the existing rules and implements the necessary measures for the strict application of international sanctions as soon as they are published. The application of these measures and the verification of the conformity of some transactions may delay the processing of transactions, according to the bank’s spokesperson. The other banks - BNP Paribas and CIC - did not respond to Sputnik's inquiry for a comment. On 24 February, Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, which had been recognised by Moscow a few days prior, appealed for help in defending themselves against Kiev's attacks. In response to Russia’s operation, Western countries imposed crippling sanctions on Moscow, targeting numerous Russian officials and entities, media, and financial institutions. Some foreign companies have decided to leave Russia altogether. Moscow has slammed these restrictions, describing the West's actions as a declaration of economic war. "

The star enhanced his reputation near the summit of the welterweight rankings with his swift TKO win against Metz on Saturday – but claimed afterwards that he was advised backstage to hide his Russian connections due to the ongoing military operation in Ukraine.“I was asked here so many times not to talk about Russia. 'Don’t you dare say anything about Russia, don’t speak Russian,' and so on,” Avanesyan told Match TV . “I don’t like this atmosphere. In terms of people’s attitudes, I didn’t feel anything like that, everything was fine. “Even in the locker room, during my conversation with friends, they said not to communicate in Russian. What is this?! We still continued to speak Russian.”A post shared by David AVA Avanesyan (@avanesyan_david)Avanesyan's experience in the United Kingdom came on the same evening that Moscow heavyweight Alexander Volkov headlined a UFC card in the English capital against hometown fighter Tom Aspinall, during which Volkov was relentlessly jeered by the crowd when it was announced he was from Russia by announcer Bruce Buffer. Volkov was quickly defeated in the first round by his English opponent.As for Avanesyan, he says that he is expecting more robust tests in his future after scything through Metz on Saturday night.“I am feeling happy, I have not seen my family for six weeks I worked hard and keep my belt,” he added after the fight.“Hopefully after a month my manager and promoter phone me and say I have a world title fight. I am ready.”Avanesyan's next move remains unclear but the fighter who is ranked #2 by the WBO and #3 by the WBC appears poised for what could be career-defining fights against the likes of Conor Benn, Keith Thurman, or Jaron ‘Boots’ Ennis."

The country's bid to join NATO was one of the reasons Moscow said it launched a military offensive last month.Medinsky made his statement a day after the sides held a peace summit in Istanbul, Turkey. He said the Ukrainian team presented a draft plan roadmapping a future peace deal.“Yesterday, for the first time, the Ukrainian party announced, not only orally but also in written form, that it’s ready to fulfill a number of the most important conditions for building normal, and, hopefully, good-neighbourly relations with Russia in the future.Let me remind you that after the 2014 coup d'état in Ukraine Russia has been making these demands to the Kiev regime, to its patrons, especially the United States, for years. Russia proposed negotiations, proposed to conclude various kinds of agreements that were supposed to guarantee Ukraine’s security and provide Russia's national interests in this area.All these demands had been ignored for years. And the North Atlantic Alliance has also been creating an anti-Russian foothold from Ukraine, more precisely, from Ukrainian territory, for years.Ukraine's entry into NATO, the creation of NATO military bases on its territory seemed to be a settled issue. It was a matter of time.I’ll note, and this has already been proven, that there were also efforts on creating biological weapons. Moreover, the issue of Ukraine's acquisition of nuclear weapons was also made public knowledge.All these years, the Kiev regime has carried out an open genocide against the residents of Donbass. There’s a lot of evidence for this. There’s irrefutable evidence that Kiev was planning to launch an offensive against Donbass in the near future. In that case Russia would have had to stand up for tens and tens of thousands of our Russian citizens living there anyway.Under these circumstances, Russia was forced to launch a pre-emptive special military operation.Yesterday, for the first time in all these years, the Kiev authorities declared that they are ready to negotiate with Russia and conveyed the provisions of a possible future agreement, which states the following:• the refusal to join NATO, fixation of Ukraine's bloc-free status;• the renunciation of nuclear weapons;• an obligation to conduct troop exercises only with the consent of the guarantor states, which must include Russia.That is, Ukraine stated that it’s ready to fulfill these demands that Russia has been insisting on all these years.If all these obligations are fulfilled, the threat of creating a NATO bridgehead on Ukrainian territory will be eliminated.That’s why it’s so important to agree upon this treaty at the highest level.However, the negotiations and our work continue.I’d like to stress that Russia’s position regarding Crimea and Donbass remains the same.”"

The impact on food prices and hunger this year and next could be substantial. Food and energy are the two biggest items in the consumption baskets of poor people all over the world,"" Okonjo-Iweala said in an interview with The Guardian, adding that ""it is poor countries and poor people within poor countries that will suffer the most."" The WTO chief went on to say that the WTO member countries should avoid the strategy of restricting the export of their own food supplies, providing an example of the so-called ""vaccine apartheid"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. Okonjo-Iweala also said that Russian and Ukrainian wheat supplies account for 24% of the global market, and that Ukraine provides about 50% of wheat to the World Food Programme, warning of a new possible catastrophe. ""If we don't think about how to mitigate the impact of the war that will be another catastrophe not just this year but next year,"" she said, adding that ""we are talking to our members and urging them not to compound this crisis by having export restrictions on food."" Ukraine and Russia remain the world's leading suppliers of wheat as well as sunflower, rapeseed, linseed and soybeans used for oil and animal feed. Half of the world's sunflower oil comes from Ukraine and another 21% from Russia. In Italy, prices of bread, pasta and meat have already risen as the country imports most of its wheat from Eastern Europe and 80% of its sunflower oil from Ukraine. Earlier this week, President of the German Farmers' Association Joachim Rukwied said that the cost of wheat and other foods in Germany has increased significantly since the beginning of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine and is expected to keep increasing. At the same time, the Carrefour supermarket chain, which is widely represented in France, Spain and Italy, said it was not experiencing any scarcity. Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council Jan Egeland warned that Somalia, importing 90% of its wheat from Ukraine and Russia, may face acute food insecurity. Last week, the WTO told Sputnik that it had received a statement of intention to take action against Russia over its military operation in Ukraine, including depriving it of the ""most favored nation"" treatment, from 14 member states. The WTO was created with the goal of liberalizing international trade and regulating trade and political relations among member states. The organization currently unites 164 countries, Russia officially joined on August 22, 2012 after 18 years of negotiations. "

However, should there be “further aggression in future” on the part of Moscow, there would have to be an option on the table to impose “snapback sanctions,” she noted.Truss revealed that she had established a special “negotiations unit” in the Foreign Office, tasked with aiding future peace talks.She is the first British official to suggest that the sweeping sanctions levied on Russia could be removed as part of a settlement between Moscow and Kiev.Her remarks echo those of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who, in a statement last Wednesday, pointed out that “sanctions in and of themselves are not designed to be permanent.” Blinken noted similarly that if “Putin stops the aggression,” the punitive economic measures could “go away.”A source close to Truss is cited by the Sunday Telegraph as having said that, as “Russia has shown it simply does not abide by international rules and treaties,” the prospect of sanctions being snapped back “would be a significant deterrent to future aggression or rule-breaking.”Since February 24, when Russian troops and military hardware crossed the Ukrainian border, the US, the EU, the UK, and several other nations have imposed on Moscow several rounds of unprecedented economic sanctions, targeting, among other entities and individuals, its central bank’s assets, a number of its commercial banks, a host of businesspeople, and the Russian leadership directly.In response, Russia has demanded that any nation buying its oil and gas that has imposed sanctions pay in rubles for importing hydrocarbons.Moscow sent its military into Ukraine a month ago, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."

On the US economic front, job openings hovered near record highs in February as vacancies continued to outpace hires in an unemployment market that remained overwhelmingly in favor of workers, the government’s monthly Job Openings And Labor Turnover Summary report showed. US consumer confidence, meanwhile, rose for the first time this year in March despite inflation and economic fallout likely from the war in Ukraine remaining high on Americans’ worry list, The Conference Board said. Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of US annual growth. US inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), grew 7.0% in 2021,  and 7.9% during the year to February - both at their fastest in four decades. The CPI’s expansion outpaces GDP, or gross domestic product, growth at 5.7% last year and projected by the Fed at 2.8% this year. Federal Reserve policy-makers like Harker have a mere tolerance of 2% for inflation in a year. They have vowed to bring inflation back to their target with a series of rate hikes through 2023.  The central bank approved its first pandemic-era rate hike on March 16, raising rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter percentage point. Harker, commenting on the central bank's forthcoming action, said he “wouldn't rule out a 50-basis-point rate hike at the next meeting” of the central bank in May. In Tuesday’s trading on Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500, which groups the top 500 US stocks, closed up 58 points, or 1.3%, at 4,633. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lists travel, aviation and cross-industry value stocks, rose 338 points, or almost 1%, to settle at 35,372. The Nasdaq Composite finished up 265 points, or 1.8%, at 14,620. "

Each of the conversations have shed light on the UK’s behind-the-scenes position on the Ukraine crisis.,"Russian pranksters Vladimir ‘Vovan’ Kuznetsov and Alexei ‘Lexus’ Stolyarov released the full video of their conversation with UK Home Secretary Priti Patel while disguised as Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. The clip offers insights into the Home Office’s response to the crisis between the West and Russia, from lobbying within Interpol aimed at kicking Russia out of the international policing body, to the seizure of Russian tycoon-owned assets and even ""special screening"" for Russian nationals seeking to enter the UK. A video of the call was originally posted on the pranksters' official YouTube channel, which was blocked by the platform on Saturday. Interpol Commenting on her government’s efforts to eject Russia from Interpol, Patel complained that the body’s reaction so far has been “absolutely feeble” and “very weak.” “They should’ve just gone for a blanket suspensions because of the barbarians that Russia are basically, and the way in which they abuse Interpol systems,” Patel said. She promised to pursue the matter with the UK’s Five Eyes intelligence alliance, and the US especially. “This is also a test for America to get leaning into the system and to really make sure that we can have tougher measures against Russia,” she said. The Home Secretary have her assurance that support for Britain’s stance wasn’t limited to western nations, and that Kenya has been “a big ally and a big supporter and a big voice”. Keeping Allies in Line Patel promised that the UK would do its part to keep allies in line generally, and make sure that they are “more robust” in their support for Kiev. “And I think, Prime Minister, if I may say so, not just on Interpol but on other issues, you see some of our allies working at a different level compared with the United Kingdom. You’ll find that we are out there in a very, very strong and forceful way, and that there are others trying to catch up,” she said. Refugees Thanked by the ‘Ukrainian Prime Minister’ for the Home Office’s simplification of UK visa procedures for Ukrainians, Patel reported that, as of 15 March, more than 4,000 visas had been issued to date “for Ukrainian nationals to come to the United Kingdom to be reunited with their family”. Patel promised to simplify the process further, and gave her personal “reassurance to making this scheme work”. Trolled by her interviewer, who said he was happy that the UK wasn’t worried about Ukrainian nationalists, Banderites and neo-Nazis coming to the country under the guise of refugees, Patel assured him that Britons are not afraid. “Clearly they’re not. For us the support is very significant here. It really is,” she said. Russian Property, Russian Rights Patel also briefed her interlocutor on the government’s new powers to deprive Russian tycoons affiliated with the Russian government of property in the UK. These powers, she said, “will enable us as a government to do two things … first of all, to clamp down on illicit Russian funds in London, but also in terms of the ability to go after their wealth, and their wealth could be their Ferraris, it could be their properties, it could be a range of assets, through new laws that we have brought in.” Patel also revealed that she is in the midst of drafting legislation that would limit the influence of “Russian agents” in the UK. Asked whether perhaps all Russians in the UK should have their rights restricted for supporting the Russian government, including through checks “in a special way” on entering the country, Patel pledged that there was “work taking place”. Assange Encouraged by the pranksters to keep working with organisations such as Bellingcat while holding investigative journalist Julian Assange locked up in prison, Patel assured her interlocutor that “our approach is very, very clear in terms of the organisations we work with”. “And of course, in certain cases, such as the Assange case, we have a judicial process that has to work within the United Kingdom. And when it comes to some of our laws such as extradition, of course that’s in the hands of the courts,” she added. ‘Englishwoman Plays It Dirty’ At the end of the interview, Patel was asked to repeat the well-known “Slava Ukraini” (‘Glory to Ukraine’) expression used by Ukrainian nationalists going back to the Second World War. She was also trolled into saying “Anglichanka Gadit!”, a Russian colloquialism meaning “An Englishwoman makes mischief” or “The Englishwoman plays it dirty,” a reference to the 19th-century foreign policy of Queen Victoria against Russia. Patel confirmed in a tweet last week that she had been duped into giving an interview to the Russian pranksters after Defence Secretary Ben Wallace tweeted that he had also been spoken to by a Russian “imposter claiming to be the Ukrainian PM”. The Wallace video call, held while the Defence Secretary was travelling in Poland, provided important details about the UK’s strategy in the Russia-West crisis over Ukraine, including plans to sail the country’s Navy into the Black Sea, the state of weapons deliveries, and even veiled support for a Ukrainian nuclear weapons programme. Vovan and Lexus have gained notoriety all over the world for their pranks on politicians, celebrities and other public figures. "

Some increase is allowed,” the unnamed official told Reuters. The anonymous official did not elaborate on whether this “great risk” might mean US secondary sanctions, nor what precisely would constitute a “significant” rise in the purchase of Russian energy. India has taken advantage of spot deals on Russian oil in recent weeks, buying more than 13 million barrels of Russian crude over the past month – just a few million barrels short of the estimated 16 million barrels New Delhi bought from Russia throughout all of 2021. A US State Department spokesman has said Washington is “engaging” India and other countries “on the importance of a strong collective action, including strong sanctions” to put pressure on Moscow amid its military operation in Ukraine. US and Australian officials expressed ""deep disappointment"" with New Delhi on Thursday over its ongoing talks with Moscow on a ruble-rupee payment mechanism in trade, which would allow India to dodge sanctions. Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan promised to “continue working with India” to chip away at its independent position on the Ukraine crisis. Last week, President Biden rebuked India for its “somewhat shaky” response to the Russian military operation in Ukraine. Indian officials responded by pointing to western hypocrisy of continuing to buy Russian oil and gas while trying to press New Delhi into shunning Russian energy supplies. US and European officials have expressed consternation about how India, Pakistan and other non-western countries have responded to the Ukraine calamity, including over the way regional rivals New Delhi and Islamabad, who rarely agree on anything, jointly abstained from condemning Russia at the UN General Assembly. Earlier this month, Pakistani President Imran Khan slammed western envoys calling on Pakistan to denounce the Russian operation in Ukraine. “What do you think of us? Are we your slaves … that whatever you say, we will do?” Khan asked. Indian officials expressed similar anger. Last week, a planned trip by a high-powered delegation of senior UK lawmakers including Commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to New Delhi and Rajasthan was cancelled after the Indian government refused to meet them. India, Pakistan, China, Iran, Iraq, Cuba, Vietnam and dozens of countries across Asia, Africa and Latin America have refused to cut ties with Moscow or stop doing business with Russian companies over the situation in Ukraine. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is expected to travel to New Delhi on Friday to meet with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and discuss the ruble-rupee payment scheme, the supply of spare parts for India’s Russia-sourced military equipment, Arctic investment, and other topics.

The president made the pop-culture reference while addressing a campaign rally in the eastern Serbian city of Pozarevac.“I’m happy that, like in the comic book about Astérix and Obelix, there’s one small tribe of Gauls that holds out and protects its freedom on the territory of Europe. And I’m proud that this small tribe is the citizens of Serbia, and our country, which conducts its policy independently and on its own,” Vucic stated.Serbia has faced mounting pressure from its neighbors since Russia launched its offensive in Ukraine last month. The country is the only European state to have maintained a neutral stance in the conflict, refusing to swell the wave of anti-Russian sanctions, despite the EU’s efforts to “harmonize” its position on Ukraine with the bloc’s.While Serbia has seen massive pro-Russian rallies, Belgrade has officially adopted a neutral position. The government has announced it will stop military cooperation with both Moscow and NATO amid the conflict, and Vucic has vowed to punish Serbs seeking to join the conflict as volunteers on either side.Moscow attacked its neighbor last month, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

The Serbian team lost the first match 3-0, leaving them with no chance of progressing to the quarterfinals.","Fans of Red Star Belgrade rolled out banners featuring the number of US military interventions during the club's match on Thursday. According to local media, the performance was dedicated to the anniversary of the ethnically-motivated violence against Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija.The banners featured the number of all military operations US forces have participated in since the Second World War, including the first Gulf War, the bombing of Yugoslavia, as well as the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.  The banners also featured a line from an anti-war song by the late singer John Lennon: ""All we are saying is give peace a chance"". Red Star Belgrade defeated Rangers 2-1, but this was not enough to progress to the quarterfinals of the Europa League as the club lost 3-0 during the first leg.The performance comes amid unprecedented tensions between Russia and the West over the situation in Ukraine. Washington and its allies accused Moscow of ""invading"" Ukraine. The Kremlin, for its part, rejected the accusations and said that the special operation Moscow is conducting is meant to de-Nazify Kiev and protect the residents of the two breakaway regions from the genocide waged by Ukraine's leadership. Moscow also accused the West of turning a blind eye to war crimes committed by Kiev in Donbass. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

That’s why we agreed to the talks, which are resuming in Istanbul,” Lavrov said during a video conference on Monday with the Serbian media. The discussions are scheduled to continue on Tuesday.The Turkish government, which has good ties with both Russia and Ukraine, has put a great deal of effort into getting the two sides around the negotiating table, Lavrov explained. However, there's no need to include the EU or the US – which support Kiev in the conflict – in the peace process, according to the minister.“There are many examples of times when the achievements of diplomacy were shattered by Western colleagues. They can’t be trusted anymore,” Lavrov opined.“I wouldn’t want to see any shuttle diplomacy from our Western partners, because they’ve already done their ‘shuttling’ – in February 2014 in Ukraine and in February 2015 in Minsk,” he added.In February 2014, the EU became the guarantor of the agreements between Ukraine’s then-president Viktor Yanukovych and the Maidan protesters in Kiev, Lavrov reminded viewers. “It was a pinnacle of diplomacy. But, the next morning, the opposition spat on that diplomacy, and the EU had to swallow it.”Yanukovich ended up being deposed after violent clashes and fleeing the country, and the new Ukrainian authorities soon sent their military to the eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk, where most of the population had refused to recognize the coup in the capital.In September of the same year, the Minsk I agreement between the breakaway republics and Kiev was reached in the Belarusian capital, having been negotiated by Ukraine, Russia, Germany, and France in the so-called Normandy Format. The deal called on the two sides to stop fighting, organize prisoner exchanges, allow deliveries of humanitarian aid, and withdraw heavy weaponry.“The diplomacy then reached new heights in February 2015, when the agreements that were signed in Minsk ended the war in eastern Ukraine and opened the way to restoring Ukraine’s territorial integrity by granting a special status to the Donbass,” the minister continued.The second agreement, Minsk II, introduced another ceasefire and paved the way for administrative and political reform in Ukraine as well as for autonomy and local elections in the Donbass republics. However, Kiev’s Western backers were subsequently unable to persuade the Ukrainian government to fulfil its promises.“The European Union has proven its incompetence as an organization that is capable of fulfilling the agreements being reached,” Lavrov said.Russia sent its troops into Ukraine over a month ago, following Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.Moscow has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."

Pansarskott 86 (international designation AT-4) are short-range anti-tank weapons designed and manufactured in Sweden by Saab Bofors Dynamics. A single weapon weighs 6.7 kg and measures 102 centimetres in length and can be used once before it is discarded. It can hit targets at a maximum distance of 400 meters. While its explosive power is not fully sufficient to knock out modern tanks, it can nevertheless destroy or deactivate armoured vehicles and fortifications. The arms assistance is meant to help Ukraine against Russia's special operation aimed to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" the country, which Sweden, in line with the rest of the West, has condemned as “invasion”. Hultqvist opened up for even more deliveries in the future. This will be the second time Sweden has contributed military equipment to a country in conflict, defying its stated principles. In the previous delivery earlier in March, Sweden contributed, among other things, anti-tank weapons, helmets, safety vests and field rations. Subsequently, Supreme Commander Chief Micael Bydén confirmed that the equipment had arrived in Ukraine. When it was decided at the end of February about the first delivery of 5,000 anti-tank rocket launchers to Ukraine, all parliamentary parties voted in favour, except the Left Party, which referred to the fact that Sweden doesn't send weapons to war zones. For doing so, the Left was castigated by fellow MPs and the press, to the point of being accused of treason. This time, the Left voted in favour of sending additional arms to the Ukraine, meaning that all of Sweden parties are now in favour of arms assistance to nation in conflict. However, this unanimity clearly contradicts with popular opinion. At the end of February, only 39 percent of Swedes thought that Stockholm should assist Ukraine with weapons. Earlier, Sweden voiced plans to boost its own defence budget to levels unseen in decades, prompting comparisons to massive Cold War-era defence hikes in the 1950s. Additionally, the perennial NATO debate has flared up anew using the Russian operation as a pretext. The special operation was launched by Moscow after Ukrainian attacks in Donbass prompted mass evacuations of civilians, forcing the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk to appeal to Russia for aid. Ever since, Moscow has stressed emphatically that it harbours no occupation plans. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

The diplomat noted that the United States has not yet destroyed its stockpiles of chemical weapons, adding that Washington is artificially delaying this process. ""We have repeatedly stressed that it is not clear to us why the United States is so slowly, in artificial delaying mode, destroying its chemical arsenal despite the availability of all resources: technological, financial and any other,"" the diplomat added.

On Monday, Biden insisted he was “talking about helping train … the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland,” again landing himself in hot water as White House officials raced to clarify that US forces are not, in fact, training foreign troops on Polish soil. During a press briefing later on Monday, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield told reporters “there is regular interaction between Ukrainian soldiers in Poland and the US troops that the president saw on the trip,” insisting that Biden did not accidentally reveal “compromised information.”“The troops that he met with in Poland routinely interact with Ukrainians. That is something that’s known,” she continued, though also declined to get into specifics about what interactions the troops have had.Asked about US forces currently stationed in Europe, Wolters said American troop levels have swelled from 60,000 to 100,000 since Russia began its military operation in Ukraine in late February. Nearly half of those soldiers are deployed to Germany, and of those, the general noted that 70% would have a direct combat role should they be activated, calling them the “teeth” of the US presence. Some of the troops may be stationed on the continent permanently, Wolters added, stating that European defense contributions in the coming months would determine EUCOM’s next steps.While Washington and other NATO states have worked to bolster Kiev’s defenses with arms shipments, the allies have repeatedly stated they will not get directly involved in the war in Ukraine, instead committing to defend the territory of member states only. Though prior US administrations have declared that Ukraine would someday be admitted into the bloc, it remains outside of NATO, and the Biden administration has warned that American intervention could kick off an armed confrontation with Moscow, or even World War III."

It urged other parties to follow its lead and provide humanitarian aid instead.“China provides Ukraine with food, milk powder, sleeping bags, quilts, and waterproof mats, but the US offers lethal weapons. It’s not hard for people to judge whether food, sleeping bags, or guns are more essential for local people,” stated Beijing’s official spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, as cited by the Chinese outlet Global Times. He added that China’s humanitarian efforts to support Ukrainian refugees had been widely supported by the international community. Lijian reproached the US for acting “hypocritically” in the wake of the refugee crisis in Ukraine, calling on the country to “deeply reflect on the root cause.”Washington has repeatedly asked Beijing to confirm its stance on the offensive. It has urged it to denounce Russia and warned of potential consequences if it provides military help to its neighbor or helps it evade economic sanctions. China has consistently condemned the sanctions, stating its view that they are an ineffective means to resolve security issues. It has encouraged Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table in order to seek a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Russia attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

The exclusion of Russia from the competition is a step that must be understood in the context of international efforts to isolate Russia in order to stop the war.”Rob McBride, the British liaison of the tree competition, said he objected to Russia’s elimination from the competition. “I’d rather keep politics out of nature projects and trees especially. Trees are apolitical.”Josef Jary, one of the organizers of the competition based in Brussels, said he was also pained by the organization’s decision to join the Russian boycotts, adding: “I can imagine a lot of normal Russian people without any political interest voted for their lovely tree, and they were very disappointed.”Meanwhile, Ludek Niedermayer, a Czech member of the European Parliament, applauded the exclusion of Russia from the contest, claiming it would be unacceptable to celebrate together with Russians right now, given the situation in Ukraine.The European Tree of the Year competition has been held annually since 2011 as a way to celebrate the history of old trees and establish bonds between nations around the common goal of preserving nature. The contenders are first selected in national contests and are then presented to the European-wide competition, where members of the public vote for their two favorite entries on the Tree of the Year website. This year, there were reportedly around 770,000 votes cast."

He told reporters that the parties are preparing an agreement on the “neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine” and providing Kiev security guarantees in return. As a sign of good faith, Russia intends to “drastically” de-escalate military activity near Kiev and Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, Fomin also announced. However, there was no talk of a ceasefire of any kind.London and Washington have led the way in imposing a wide-ranging embargo on Russian goods, services, property, bank reserves, transactions, individuals, and government officials.Though the US insists that “the world” has sanctioned Russia, the embargo has been limited to Washington’s NATO allies, plus Australia, Japan, and South Korea.Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the Donbass by force."

On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the move ""theft.""","The collective West's decision to freeze Russian reserves abroad constitutes the bankruptcy of their obligations before Russia, and undermines faith in their currencies, President Vladimir Putin has said. ""In this connection, it's clear that supplying our goods to the European Union and the United States and receiving payment in dollars, euros and a number of other currencies does not make any sense to us,"" Putin added. Putin ordered the Russian Central Bank and the government to work out the means for payments to be made in rubles for Russian natural gas exports by countries designated as 'unfriendly' by Moscow, and instructed Gazprom to amend existing contracts accordingly.  ""Unlike some of our colleagues, we value our business reputation as a reliable partner and supplier. The changes will only affect the payment currency, which will be changed to Russian rubles,"" Putin stressed. ""Russia will unquestionably continue to export natural gas in accordance with volumes at prices fixed in contracts concluded earlier,"" he added.  Russia exports an estimated $10 billion in gas monthly. The European Union imported $108 billion in energy supplies from Russia in 2021, accounting for about 62 percent of total consumption. About $300 billion out from the Central Bank's $640 billion national reserve cushion, which was carefully amassed over the years for a rainy day, including by forgoing spending on various government and social programmes, were frozen in an instant after the US and its allies introduced sanctions on Russia over its military operation in Ukraine. In a speech in Moscow earlier Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov characterized the freeze as blatant ""theft."" Earlier, the Kremlin suggested that the West's actions constitute an ""economic war"" against Russia. On Monday, Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das assured that New Delhi's assets were safe and ""quite diversified,"" but said that that the example of the freezing of Russia's reserves by Western countries ""was something which going forward every country will start thinking about."" On Wednesday, Axios reported that US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen is planning to meet with a group of senators to discuss a bill seeking to lock down $132 billion in Russian gold reserves by sanctioning transactions involving Russia and the precious commodity to eliminate loopholes through which Moscow might convert money into gold. The freeze on Russia's reserves abroad has sparked questions among media and politicians about why Russian fiscal authorities made the decision to transfer the country's hard-earned assets abroad in the first place, with some blaming Siluanov and Central Bank governor Elvira Nabiullina for the fiasco. The Central Bank has not commented on the matter, but observers have explained that some of the reserves were placed in Western banks to collect interest, instead of being held in physical cash, while securities and government bonds were held in those countries where they originated, as is standard practice. Last week, Spiegel contributer Henrik Muller warned that the scandal surrounding Russia's reserves may be a signal that the dollar's status as the de facto world currency may be coming to an end. ""Should fears spread that the US government could confiscate currency assets at any time, this could cause massive damage to the dollar...[For] countries with large currency resereves, the question arises as to whether their balances with the Fed (and other Western central banks participating in sanctions) are still safe...The country with by far the largest forex reserves is China. The Saudis and other Gulf emirates also have substantial dollar holdings,"" Muller wrote. "

Sport’ forum in Moscow on Wednesday, the grateful Matytsin praised the two stars for their backing in recent weeks – a stance which has seen Karjakin banned by the chess authorities while Rylov is facing an investigation from international swimming officials.“Today we have Sergey Karjakin and Evgeny Rylov with us. I want to thank you for your courageous patriotic position,” said Matytsin, addressing both men.“For the example that you gave for all sportspeople, for all Russians, how to defend sport and to defend the position of our government, without hesitation.”Rylov appeared at a mass meeting at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium earlier this month which marked the reunification of Russia and Crimea.The swimmer – who won double gold at the Tokyo Olympics last summer – was seen bearing a ‘Z’ symbol on his jacket, which has featured on Russian military hardware in Ukraine and has been adopted as a show of support for Russian forces.Rylov’s attendance at the event has triggered an investigation by the FINA Disciplinary Panel, while the 25-year-old has also been stripped of a sponsorship deal with Speedo.Before Russian and Belarusian swimmers were banned from this summer’s World Championships in Budapest, Rylov had said he would boycott the event in solidarity with Russian Paralympic athletes who had been barred from competing at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games.Also praised by Matytsin was chess star Karjakin, who was slapped with a six-month ban by governing body FIDE this month for his vocal support of the Russian operation in Ukraine.Karjakin, a former world rapid and blitz champion who contested the world title against Magnus Carlsen in 2016, issued his full support for Russian President Vladimir Putin at the outset of the offensive in Ukraine.He reacted to the news of his ban by suggesting chess bosses had been desperate to deny him a place at the upcoming FIDE Candidates Tournament, the winner of which will challenge Carlsen for the world title.Karjakin, 32, has also suggested he could set up a rival organization to FIDE."

The communists – who view the war in Ukraine as a clash of capitalist powers – said that the posters recall the Nazi-era persecution of Jews.The posters feature a pig in the colors of the Russian flag, along with the text “Good Russian = Dead Russian.” According to the Russian news outlet Readovka, they appeared in London, and the logo of London’s public transport corporation can be seen in the background of a photo shared by Readovka.“IF YOU SEE ONE, RIP IT DOWN,” the Communist Party of Britain tweeted on Monday. “Authorities should act swiftly against such anti-worker posters,” the communists continued. “We need unity between people.

Likewise, it is unclear who put up the posters.While the Communist Party of Britain has repeatedly drawn attention to the prevalence of Nazi ideology in the ranks of the Ukrainian military, it opposes both sides in the Ukraine/Russia conflict. The communists view Ukraine as fighting for the “expansionist NATO powers” and Russian President Vladimir Putin as protecting the interests of “Russia’s big business oligarchs.” Nevertheless, the communists, like Russia, see a demilitarized and neutral Ukraine as the war’s ideal end state.The posters appeared amid a wave of anti-Russian sentiment in the Western world. Russian musicians and performers have been blacklisted in the US and Europe for refusing to denounce Putin, Russian products have been pulled from the shelves in American stores, and Russian shops and restaurants have been vandalized from Berlin to Washington DC. With punishing economic sanctions impacting the lives of ordinary Russians at home, Russian schoolchildren have reportedly faced bullying in European schools and one medical clinic in Munich, Germany even said it would refuse to treat Russian and Belarussian patients earlier this month, before reversing its decision amid a public outcry.Earlier this month, the Russian Foreign Ministry said it was taking note of “the unprecedented level of Russophobia” and that “those responsible will be brought to responsibility in accordance with the current law.”"

On 7 March, the Russian Defence Ministry said that the Russian armed forces had found 30 biological laboratories in Ukraine supervised by the US Department of Defence and possibly involved in the production of biological weapons. On 8 March, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told the Senate that the US was working with Ukraine to protect biological laboratories located there as the Russian military ""may be seeking to gain control"" of these facilities during Moscow's special military operation.

In the second segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Rafiki Morris, organizer with the All Africa People’s Revolutionary Party, member of the Coordinating Committee for the Black Alliance for Peace to discuss the political repression of The African Party of Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) in Guinea-Bissau, the current president’s illegitimate seizure of power and reactionary alignment and why that motivates the repression of the PAIGC from posing a challenge to his rule, and why people in the US should be concerned with political developments on the African continent. In the third segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Dr. Tamanisha John, professor at Clark Atlanta University and Caribbean regional analyst to discuss Jamaica’s recent maneuvers to become a republic and remove the UK queen as its head of state, the labor and trade relationships that the UK still has with Jamaica that act as another avenue of colonialism and drains resources from Jamaica, and the coercive infrastructure of the commonwealth system that blunts the effect of nations declaring themselves as republics. Later in the show, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Margaret Kimberley, editor and senior columnist at Black Agenda Report and author of the book ""Prejudential: Black America and the Presidents"" to discuss the worrying signs of another surge in COVID-19 infections from the BA.2 subvariant as funding for testing and treatment is used to provide weapons and prolong the war in Ukraine, how the Congressional Black Caucus’ failure to live up to its progressive legacy on Ukraine encapsulates the neoliberal shell that the caucus has become, and the folly of giving up on principles to gain a “seat at the table.” We'd love to get your feedback at radio@sputniknews.com The views and opinions expressed in this programme are those of the speakers and do not necessarily reflect the position of Sputnik.

Vienna made the move fearing shortages should Russia insist on payments in rubles, rather than dollars or euro, due to Western sanctions. The stage-one alert means there are “concrete and reliable indications that the gas supply could deteriorate,” Austria’s Climate Ministry announced, adding that it will be “monitoring” the situation. The country’s reserve tanks currently stand at 13% of capacity, which is about average for the season, local media reported.“Everything will be done to ensure the gas supply for Austria’s households and businesses,” Chancellor Karl Nehammer said on Wednesday. If disruptions happen, businesses will be encouraged to seek out alternatives, while gas rationing won’t happen until stage three, the government said.Vienna’s declaration comes hours after Berlin declared the identical stage-one emergency, fearing a possible disruption of natural gas supplies as the clock ticked closer to Russia’s deadline for “unfriendly countries” to start paying in rubles.Germany and the rest of the EU were designated unfriendly by Moscow over their embargoes on trade, imposed due to Russia’s military attack on Ukraine, last month. If Russia is unable to receive payments for the natural gas shipments in euros or dollars – the US has likewise sanctioned its currency – then it will be rubles or nothing, Moscow has stated.When EU leaders complained about how this would be breach of contract, Russia responded that their sanctions amounted to as much. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov made it clear on Tuesday that Russia had no intention of supplying gas to Europe for free.Germany’s top industrial unions have warned that delivery interruptions could result in “the rapid collapse of the industrial production chains in Europe – with worldwide consequences.”Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz discussed the problem earlier on Wednesday, with Moscow and Berlin providing somewhat conflicting readouts of their call.According to the Germans, Putin said payments could still be made to a bank that hasn’t been embargoed, and Scholz asked for written information to better understand the procedure. The Kremlin said that “experts of the two countries would discuss the issue further.”Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two Donbass republics by force."

The ministry hasn't specified yet the location of the training centre or if any mercs were killed in the strike. A video showing the high-precision strike has been shared by the MoD: On 21 March, Russian troops hit yet another training centre for foreign mercenaries and  Ukrainian nationalists in the Rovno region with precision-guided cruise missiles. That day, over 80 mercenaries and Ukrainian nationalists were eliminated, the MoD said. The day before, 100 Ukrainian troops and mercenaries were killed in the Zhitomir region after the Russian armed forces launched a series of high-precision missile strikes on the training centre for covert operations forces of the Ukrainian military, where foreign mercs were based. Prior to that, up to 180 foreign mercenaries were killed in precision strikes against Ukrainian training centres located at the Yavorovsky military compound and near the settlement of Starichi. The Russian Defence Ministry stressed that those facilities were being used to train and organise  foreign mercenaries to fight Russian troops in Eastern Ukraine, as well as to store weaponry sent to the country by foreign nations. Russia has on multiple occasions urged foreign countries to prevent their citizens from travelling to Ukraine in order to join the hostilities there as the Russian Armed Forces conduct a special military operation in the country. Moscow warned that anyone attacking Russian troops will be  considered a legitimate target. In early March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that 16,000 foreign mercenaries were going to fight for Ukraine. He encouraged ""anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe,  and the world"" to ""come and fight side by side with Ukrainians"" against the Russian military. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has promised simplified visa and entry procedures for all foreign fighters. Russian President Vladimir Putin authorised the launch of the special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, following a request from the newly recognised Donetsk and Lugansk  People's Republics (DPR and LPR). He stressed that Moscow was left with no other choice after Kiev failed to implement the Minsk agreements and had to protect the Donbass population following continued attacks by Ukrainian forces. The president said that the key goals of the op are the ""demilitarisation and de-Nazification"" of the neighbouring country. Western countries led by the US have condemned the operation, branding it an ""invasion"" and expressed a readiness to pump Ukraine with weapons, but stopped short of pledging other military assistance, citing fears of triggering World War III.

Washington and its allies have made allegations in recent days that Moscow might be preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine. Russia has rejected the assertions and countered that Kiev might be planning a “false flag” to pin the blame on Moscow and trigger a NATO intervention.Biden conceded that the US-led sanctions against Russia – joined by NATO, Japan, Australia, and South Korea so far – will result in global food shortages, but pointed out that the US and Canada are major sources of wheat and are exploring ways to ramp up production and exports.He said NATO and the EU are working to set up an organization that would keep track of other countries violating their sanctions. Biden added that he had warned China against helping Russia because that would put its economic interests in the West in “significant jeopardy.”“China understands its economic future is much more closely tied to the West than it is to Russia,” Biden told reporters. The US president insisted that the sanctions were never meant as a deterrent, but to maintain NATO unity, which he called the most important thing at this moment. Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.

They claim the trio was targeted by either chemical weapons or electromagnetic radiation.According to the outlet, Abramovich and at least two senior Ukrainian negotiators “suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning” after a meeting in Kiev earlier this month. Their symptoms included “red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands,” claimed to people familiar with the matter, who blamed the suspected attack on “hard-liners in Moscow” not interested in ending the conflict in Ukraine.Ukrainian officials were skeptical of the report, however. Presidential adviser Mikhail Podolyak told Reuters “there is a lot of speculation, various conspiracy theories,” while Rustem Umerov, allegedly one of the three persons affected, said people should not trust “unverified information.”The investigation was organized by Christo Grozev of Bellingcat, which the WSJ described as an “open-source collective.” Bellingcat has claimed Russia’s involvement in the alleged 2018 poisoning of Sergey and Yulia Skripal in the UK and of activist Alexey Navalny in 2020. Russia designated it a foreign agent in December 2020, citing Bellingcat’s ties to Western intelligence agencies and funding by the US, British and Dutch governments. “Bellingcat can confirm that three members of the delegation attending the peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on the night of 3 to 4 March 2022 experienced symptoms consistent with poisoning with chemical weapons. One of [the] victims was Russian entrepreneur Roman Abramovich,” the outfit tweeted on Monday.“It was not intended to kill, it was just a warning,” Grozev told the WSJ. He said he saw photos of Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators that led him to suspect an attack, but could not arrange a sample in a timely manner. By the time German forensic experts were able to perform an examination, too much time had passed to detect a suspected poison, according to Grozev.Again citing people familiar with the matter, the WSJ said Western experts could not determine if the symptoms were caused by a chemical or biological agent, or “some sort of electromagnetic-radiation attack” – a description that sounds like the mysterious “Havana Syndrome,” alleged by some US spies to be the result of some kind of Russian energy weapon.The WSJ reported last week that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had asked the White House not to sanction Abramovich, because he was trying to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine – again, citing anonymous sources. Others quoted in the article weren’t clear whether Abramovich was actually involved in the talks, and he was placed on the sanctions list anyway.The Yeltsin-era oil baron, who lived in the UK and owns the football club Chelsea, has reportedly been acting as a “back channel” between the Kremlin and Kiev, meeting with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky over the past month.Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake Donbass by force."

Issues of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and international law were increasingly prominent in African and South Asian countries, where China had invested heavily in local grids and power plants, she said.The diplomat went on to stress that the European concept of sovereignty, in contrast, postulated “cooperation where possible and autonomy where necessary.” She added that nations “can only act autonomously when they are not completely dependent on others.” The statement was part of a broader announcement of Germany’s new national security strategy.Unsurprisingly, Russia’s military action against Ukraine came very much to the fore during Baerbock’s speech. The minister said none of the German officials who had been working on the strategy could have imagined that the Russian president would “attack his neighbor.” She accused Moscow of breaking “our peace order in Europe” as well as the “charter of the United Nations.” In light of that, Germany must more assertively implement some of the core principles “that lead us,” she proclaimed.Among those principles, she said, was a clear stance that “in questions of war and peace, justice and injustice, no country, including Germany, can be neutral.” She cited the references to her country’s Nazi past made recently by several Russian officials, saying that it was precisely “out of our history, out of Germany’s guilt about war and genocide” that a “special responsibility” arose to always “stand on the side of those whose life, freedom, and rights are being threatened.”She pointed out that Germany should disabuse itself of the old notion that there were “good and bad dictators.” Berlin and its allies should instead defend their values and stance globally, she urged, but this should not preclude them from talking to authoritarian regimes. And while diplomacy was of great importance, Germany should, at the same time, not allow such regimes to gag it just because it was “dependent in terms of economy or energy.”The second core principle outlined by Baerbock was an improved ability to act, which she said went hand in hand with international unity, especially within the EU and among G7 and NATO member states.Last but not least, security policies should go beyond the purview of Germany’s defense and foreign ministries, Baerbock argued. Areas such as infrastructure investment and trade also contributed to the security of the German state, she emphasized. She concluded that, to ensure that security, Berlin would have to become more inventive, pragmatic, and able to “think outside the box.”"

The Ukrainian government claimed Russia had directed the “aggression"", although Moscow insisted its troops never entered the Donbass.""I have visited more than 120 schools, talked to thousands of children, held more than 100 children's sports events even though I am an ordinary Russian girl, not an iron, fearless 'Terminator' warrior,"" said Naumova, refering to arguably Schwarzenegger's best-known film character.A post shared by Maryana Naumova (@maryana_n)""You say that there is no Nazism in Ukraine, you tell about the Jewish President of Ukraine [Volodymyr Zelensky] and say that Russian bombs are allegedly destroying Ukraine now.""Arnold, sometimes it is very difficult to understand, being thousands and thousands of kilometers away from us, but you still have those letters and photos from 2015, don't you? In fact, you could just come and see everything in person – you are a brave man.""Issuing his message last week, Schwarzenegger voiced his admiration for Russians and said his aim was to speak the ""truth"" about what he described as an illegal and senseless war that had been condemned worldwide.Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that one of the aims of the attack is to target Nazis in Ukraine, but Schwarzenegger strongly questioned the validity of that argument and suggested that Russian citizens did not agree with the decision to start the attack on February 24.""Obviously, you didn't work on the letters I gave you, even though you promised,"" Naumova told the former Governor of California, adding that the Alley of Angels memorial in Donetsk is a memorial to children ""killed by bullets and bombs of the Ukrainian army.""A post shared by Maryana Naumova (@maryana_n)""Your message is based on some other invented reality. The reality is, Arnold, that your 'Terminator' not only did not protect, but did not help, did not save the children of Donbass, did not read their letters and try to understand the situation.""The former world champion powerlifter, dubbed the 'world’s strongest girl’ by some media outlets in the aftermath of her athletic feats, has said that Russia should have taken action in the region eight years ago.She also responded to Schwarzenegger's remarks about his father, who was among Nazi German troops to have attacked Putin's birth city of St. Petersburg – then Leningrad – during World War Two.""You tell about your father, who did not like Nazis and who, along with the Nazis, came with weapons to my Russian – then Soviet – land,"" she said, appearing to then refer to reports that Schwarzenegger offered US military personnel fitness advice during the US coalition-led war in Iraq in 1990 and 1991.""Haven't you visited American soldiers in Iraq? You taught them to train and keep fit during Operation Desert Storm.""I'm not asking what your American military was doing in Iraq at that time and why they ruined that country – probably your government knows better.A post shared by Maryana Naumova (@maryana_n)""But I would like to remind you: your family once was already deceived by Nazism and your father came to my homeland with a gun, killing and maiming my compatriots.""It was this mistake that caused your poor childhood. It was because of this mistake that your father did not like Russians until the end of his life.""[Nazi leader Adolf] Hitler got what he deserved then – but, after so many years, his ideological heirs are raising their heads again.""I would like to remind you that you yourself once admired Hitler, after which you repented for a long time.""But those in Ukraine who admire Hitler's collaborators, such as [early 20th century ultranationalist politician] Stepan Bandera, are far from repenting.""A post shared by Maryana Naumova (@maryana_n)Schwarzenegger once admitted in an autobiography that he appreciated Hitler as a speaker but has always denied allegations that he admires the former German leader.Naumova, who has also told her thousands of Instagram followers that ""no-one wants war"", said that more than 14,000 civilians have been killed since the current Ukrainian government came to power.She added that cities had been renamed after Nazi criminals and said Ukraine had been ""subjugated"" into an ""uncontrollable monster"".""Russophobia is as terrible as anti-Semitism,"" she said, calling Ukraine a danger to all of its neighbors.""Russia's special military operation has no purpose to destroy the Ukrainian people. It is aimed at neo-Nazis.""Zelenskyy has called Putin's statements about Nazism in Ukraine ""laughable"".

Russia accused Ukraine of laying hundreds of obsolete floating mines in order to prevent it from seizing its ports.“The mines are detected in our area, not in the area belonging to Russia or Ukraine,” Akar told reporters on Tuesday. “We are cooperating with Romania and Bulgaria [on the matter].”Akar said Turkish minesweepers and naval patrol aircraft were placed on alert. He declined to specify how many mines had been discovered so far or where they came from. “It wouldn’t be right to say if the mines were laid in Ukraine or came from elsewhere, without being sure,” he said. “Our work on the matter continues.”The minister previously said that, on Saturday, the Turkish Navy found and deactivated an old drifting mine near the Bosphorus Strait. Two days later, the Defense Ministry reported detecting and neutralizing another mine off Igneada, a town near the border with Bulgaria.The Romanian Navy similarly reported on Monday that fishermen spotted a mine floating around 70 kilometers (43 miles) off the coast. The Navy dispatched a minesweeper with divers on board, and the mine was safely destroyed.The news came a week after the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed the Ukrainian Navy laid around 420 “obsolete” floating mines outside the entrance to several of its ports. Wind and currents can carry such mines to the western parts of the Black Sea, the FSB warned.Responding to Turkey’s report about the discovered mine on Saturday, the Ukrainian Navy accused Russia of “paralyzing the free navigation for all Black Sea countries” and “endangering the lives of civilian sailors.”Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO, a US-led military bloc. Kiev says the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

His apparent call for ousting the Russian president was no exception last week.","Fox News host Tucker Carlson has echoed President Joe Biden's words ""for God's sakes, this man cannot remain in power"" in the latest episode of his show… although unlike POTUS, the anchor did not direct them against Russian President Vladimir Putin, but rather Biden himself. Carlson pointed out inconsistencies in Biden's latest speeches, namely his denial of the fact that many of the things he said last week were immediately walked back by the White House in an apparent damage control effort. And as soon as POTUS claimed that he was not in fact walking back his statements, he did it again… by denying he was serious about ousting Vladimir Putin at the end of his ""major"" speech in Poland last week. The conservative TV host further noted that as much as no one wants to make ""fun of [Biden's] age or his diminished condition"", there is no room for mistakes when the world is ""on the cusp of a war with a nuclear-armed power"". Carlson thus argued that it was high time to replace Biden using the 25th amendment, which allows the vice president to take over if the president dies or is unable to fulfil his duties properly. Biden used the phrase, repeated by Carlson, during his speech in Poland on 26 March as he seemingly called for Putin to be ousted. The White House later claimed that Biden was not calling for a ""regime change"" in Russia after already correcting POTUS several times that week after his remarks created the impression that US troops might be deployed in Ukraine and that the US might use chemical weapons against Russia.

While repeatedly denouncing the sanctions against Russia, China itself has faced threats of restrictions from the US if it refuses to condemn Moscow.","China's Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said on Saturday that the sanctions against Russia are ""outrageous"" and spoke against NATO's eastward expansion, according to Reuters. “The sanctions against Russia are getting more and more outrageous"", he said at a security forum in Beijing. Le Yucheng added that Russian citizens were being deprived of overseas assets ""for no reason"". ""History has proven time and again that sanctions cannot solve problems. Sanctions will only harm ordinary people, impact the economic and financial system...and worsen the global economy"", he stressed. Like many other high-ranking Chinese officials, he acknowledged Moscow's concerns over NATO, saying the alliance should not expand further to the east, forcing a nuclear power like Russia ""into a corner"". At the end of 2021, Russia published its main security demands for NATO, calling for legal guarantees of NATO's non-expansion eastward and Ukraine's non-participation in the alliance. Moscow also requested that NATO not establish military bases in post-Soviet countries. The proposals additionally contained a demand for non-deployment of NATO strike weapons near Russian borders and the withdrawal of the alliance's forces in Eastern Europe to its 1997 frontiers. Meanwhile, shortly before the publication of the Russian proposals, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated that Ukraine is a sovereign country that must determine its own future, and the decision of its accession to the alliance would only be made by its government and the 30 NATO member states. Since the start of the Russian special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, over 2,700 new sanctions have been introduced against Moscow, nearly doubling the pre-existing number. Despite China not having explicitly expressed its support for Russia, officials in Beijing have condemned the sanctions pressure imposed by Western countries, with Chinese officials noting that the Kremlin's security concerns over NATO's eastward expansion are justified and should be respected. Earlier this week, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce Gao Feng noted that trade restrictions destabilise the world market, saying that Beijing is determined to ""take the necessary measures and protect the legitimate rights and interests of its companies, engaged in ordinary trading activities"". According to him, the restrictive measures undertaken against Russian businesses would not only ""fail to resolve security problems, but can also have an extremely negative impact on consumers"", which ""creates additional difficulties for the global economy, which is undergoing a recession"". During a recent phone call between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the former warned his counterpart about the consequences that await China in case of support for Russia. The assistance that Beijing can offer Moscow has been an object of concern in Washington, as China's ability to supply analogues of Western goods that have fallen under sanctions could minimise the negative effect of the restrictions. Apart from that, Russia and China were said to be mulling further financial cooperation that could include an increase of mutual payments in national currencies as a way to avoid the pressure that the dollar deficit puts on the Russian economy.

He said his goal was “achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of [Russian] troops by diplomatic means.”“If we want to do that, we can’t escalate, either in words or actions,” Macron stressed.Biden had earlier called Putin a “butcher” after visiting a stadium in Warsaw hosting Ukrainian refugees. In his speech later on that day, the US president proclaimed, “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.”US officials subsequently clarified that Biden hadn’t been calling for regime change. An unnamed White House official told the media the president had gone off script when he delivered the controversial line.“A national leader has to keep a cool head,” Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov remarked in response to Biden’s words. “Personal insults narrow the window” for cooperation between Moscow and Washington, he added.Russia sent its troops into Ukraine, over a month ago, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

Previously, Ukraine was perceived in the West as a corrupt hellhole and its leader as a would-be authoritarian, so the U-turn is “confusing,” Rogan said on his show on Saturday.“This is one of the things that is so weird is that they were very disparaging of Ukraine. They were talking about [the] massive corruption of Ukraine and how horrible it was over there. And now all of a sudden they are looking at it like they’re heroes,” he observed.Rogan offered a collection of articles in the Western press explaining Ukraine’s corruption problems and the increasing slide towards authoritarianism under Zelensky as well as his alleged personal grift.“We are supposed to take a hard-right turn, a veer away, a hard angle away from the narrative that was being pushed just a couple of years ago. And we are supposed to just ignore all this stuff now,” he said, describing the situation as a “fog of information distribution.”The episode, which featured ex-CIA officer Mike Baker as a guest, was focused on the conflict in Ukraine and how it affected politics in the US. The discussion was overwhelmingly negative towards Russia, its planning for the Ukraine operation, and President Vladimir Putin personally. Baker, however, acknowledged that much of the US perception of decision making in the Kremlin was guesswork rather than hard intelligence.The guest suggested that Ukraine’s case was a good example of how the US government has to operate “in the real world” rather than base its policies on emotions and always take the moral high ground. In the same way, Washington has ties to Riyadh and even to Moscow when it comes to negotiations with Iran on resuming the 2015 nuclear deal, Baker said.The host commented on the American public’s obliviousness to affairs in Ukraine. He said most people “just found out recently that a comedian is running the country,” referring to Zelensky’s background as an entertainer.Rogan lamented that the media in the US were generally fond of pushing a “narrative” rather than informing the people and thus couldn’t be trusted to tell all the facts. “Some f**kery is afoot,” was how he described the situation."

The Ukrainian government has claimed that Russia's alleged ""policy of nuclear terrorism"" counts as an ""indisputable basis"" for the country's expulsion from the international atomic watchdog.She reportedly cited Russian troops taking over several Ukrainian nuclear plants as an example of this behavior.Russian troops took control of the defunct Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on the first day of Moscow's military offensive, last moment. Shortly afterwards, the Russian military issued a statement, saying that th plant's staff were continuing to work and there was no threat of a nuclear accident. Ukrainian authorities have, however, claimed that Russian troops are forcing staff to work long shifts without rotation – a situation the IAEA's Director General, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has called potentially dangerous. In a statement released last Tuesday, Grossi warned that the Chernobyl plant employees were operating ""under enormous stress without the necessary rest.""On top of that, on March 9 the facility's power supply was cut, with staff having to switch on backup diesel generators to ensure that the cooling system functioned normally. Five days later, one of the power lines supplying the plant with electricity was restored. According to the Russian military, the outage was caused by Ukrainian shelling of a nearby electrical substation.Kiev has also accused Russian troops of setting fire to the woods surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, releasing radioactive particles into the air.On March 4, Russian forces took over the Zaporozhskaya Nuclear Power Plant in the south of Ukraine. According to media reports, one of the buildings in the compound caught fire as a result of fighting, with Kiev and Moscow blaming each other for the incident.Apart from the plants now under Russian control, there are three more operational nuclear power plants across Ukraine."

According to the report, citing sources within the discussions, a so-called 'Tiger Team' is considering what to do if Russia crosses into NATO territory to destroy convoys carrying weapons and aid to embattled Ukraine.  The committee, which reportedly meets three times a week in closed meetings, is also considering how to respond if Russia moves into neighboring countries such as Moldova and Georgia, as well as how to prepare European countries for a massive new influx of refugees. Those eventualities are said to be important to Biden's closed door meetings with leaders of the 29 other NATO nations expected on Thursday in Brussels.  According to sources, the team of officials was established in a memo signed by Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, on February 28, four days after the special military operation began.  An earlier incarnation spent months secretly preparing the US administration for the possibility of the current Russian action in Ukraine. That group was instrumental in developing playbooks for harsh sanctions, troop buildups in NATO countries, and arming the Ukrainian military. The Tiger Team is examining what threshold would compel the alliance to deploy military force in Ukraine as one of its main concerns. This comes after Biden made it clear that he is adamantly opposed to doing so, believing that a direct involvement in ongoing conflict would spiral it out of control, adding that it would be ""World War 3.""  Sullivan's memo also reportedly organized a second team of officials to look at long-term potential for the US to better its geopolitical position as a result of the current standoff over the Ukraine crisis. According to the outlet, the White House believes that the special military operation will hurt Russia in the long term, hurt its economy, and alienate potential allies for years, but some officials reportedly caution that it is too early to tell. In recent weeks, the White House and NATO headquarters have ramped up warnings that Russia may resort to its most potent weapons in its special military operation. Also on Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned that if weapons of mass destruction were used inside Ukraine, it would have ""dire consequences"" for NATO. He also reportedly mentioned that one question being investigated is whether collateral damage would be considered an ""attack"" on NATO under the organization's charter, evoking the military response. The claims are made as Russian troops discover secret biolaboratories in Ukraine, that were funded by the US. And according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, these laboratories could be used to develop biological weapons.  Russia has also repeatedly stressed that it has disposed of its stockpiles of chemical weapons, while the US has its stockpiles. On Tuesday, the Russian embassy in the nation noted that Washington deliberately delayed the destruction of their remaining 3% of chemical weapons. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with CNN this week that the Russian government would only resort to using nuclear weapons in the event of an ""existential threat"" to its own existence. On Thursday, Biden will attend an extraordinary NATO summit on Ukraine and meet with G7 leaders, according to the White House. He will also attend a European Council summit and hold a bilateral meeting with European Council President Charles Michel, before ending his trip in Warsaw on Saturday where he will discuss humanitarian issues with his Polish counterpart.

However, how should one interpret this type of behaviour - is it a show of force or a sign of weakness?","Since the beginning of Moscow's military operation in Ukraine, the video hosting platform has targeted Russian state-run media outlets, and even the channels of Soviet television and radio Gosteleradiofond, which broadcast archive materials recorded before 1999. In one of its most recent restrictions against Russian channels, YouTube blocked the account of pranksters Vovan and Lexus after the release of their conversations with UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Home Secretary Priti Patel, which provided a glimpse into London's behind-the-scenes position regarding the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. While YouTube cited a ""violation of community rules"", critics have slammed the video hosting platform for dealing a blow to free speech in yet another act of mass censorship in the wake of the events in Ukraine. What could be behind YouTube's decision to censor the Russian pranksters? The move could be due to the West's desire to silence an embarrassing story that could highlight things that the UK would prefer not to be made public. Hudak goes on to recall how Wallace mentioned that Britain has troops in Estonia, Poland, and Lithuania, and is ""happy to be with Ukraine"", thus ""suggesting the potential for British troops"" on Ukrainian territory. This came just ahead of US President Joe Biden's slip-up in Poland, where he spoke to US soldiers in Rzeszow and told them that when they ""get there” (to Ukraine), they will see ""women and young people [...] standing in front of a tank"". Hudak criticised the influence that Western government entities appear to have over social media platforms - YouTube in particular. But he also had a straightforward explanation as to why the West wants to shut down any alternative sources of information. ""The danger in the information is that it is true or at least encourages people to question the agenda and policy of the establishment. When the public begins to disagree with or at least question its government’s actions and overall strategy and goal, it becomes far more difficult for that government to continue with its plan. To prevent this from happening, the establishment must concentrate the diversity of information available to the public, which is why we see mass censorship taking place at the moment"", he explains. Joseph Oliver Boyd Barrett, emeritus professor at Bowling Green State University, offered his own look at the decisions by YouTube and other major social media platforms. According to him, the Western media's aim is to ""exclude"" information it deems unsuitable for the official narrative ""in ways that do not immediately attract charges of outright censorship"".  However, that was easier to do without the Internet, and now that the global web provides access to points of view that may differ from the mainstream, tougher tools become necessary. But why are alternative viewpoints being targeted at all? According to Barrett, it's all about ""monopolising the public conversation"". ""The collusion of mainstream media is assured through their shared political and economic interests, by threats and incentives, and the operations of intelligence agencies that routinely penetrate media with their own people, recruit media operatives, ply media outlets with privileged information or disinformation and so on"", he explains. In the wake of Big Tech companies tightening the screws and attempting to shape the narrative in their preferred way, it might be useful for media companies and outlets to invest in building ""a profile on other platforms that are not part of the Big Tech conglomerate"", Taylor Hudak suggests. But this alone would not be enough, he adds. YouTube blocked Vovan and Lexus' channel on Saturday, effectively removing the videos the two pranksters had shared that revealed their conversations with top UK officials. In the phone talks, the two pretended to be Ukrainian PM Denis Shmygal and managed to gain some insight into the British view of the Ukraine crisis. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace happened to share details on British arms supplies to Ukraine and views on Kiev's ""plans"" regarding its nuclear programme, while Home Secretary Priti Patel pledged to strip Russian tycoons of their assets and ensure the support of the UK's allies for Ukraine. After the videos emerged online, the UK officials immediately asserted that they had been ""doctored"" and that they are part of ""Russian propaganda"", calling on YouTube to remove them. YouTube was quick to comply, just as it did when Western countries imposed a slew of anti-Russian sanctions, particularly demanding that online access to Russian media outlets be restricted, while allowing anti-Russian ads on the platform.  This move by Big Tech firms was slammed by Russia as censorship, with media watchdog Roskomnadzor condemning the social media platforms' actions as something that ""not only violate[s] Russian law but also contradict generally accepted norms of morality"".

The diplomat also warned the Baltic states against sending their “little battalions” to fight Russian troops in Ukraine.“Our Polish colleagues have already stated that there will be a NATO summit now, and peacekeepers should be deployed. I hope they understand what is at stake. This will be a direct clash between the Russian and NATO armed forces, which everyone not only wanted to avoid but said that it should never take place in principle,” he outlined. Earlier last week, the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia reportedly traveled to Kiev to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Afterwards, Polish Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczynski declared that NATO should deploy a peacekeeping mission to Ukraine while the EU should grant Kiev official candidate status. “I believe that a NATO peacekeeping mission is needed, a mission that can defend itself and that will operate in Ukraine,” said Kaczynski.Previously, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson rejected Kiev’s plea to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying it would inevitably lead to a direct clash with Russia. US President Joe Biden also stated that “[Washington] will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine” warning that a direct confrontation between NATO and Moscow is one way to start World War III.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

He also reported that nearly 800 planes out of its 1,300-strong air fleet have now been registered inside the state's jurisdiction.The planes were seized even in several countries that Moscow considers friendly – namely Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. The Russian authorities have tried to negotiate the buyout of the detained planes but to no avail. Their owners have demanded undisputed return of the assets.“Almost 800 machines have been transferred [to the Russian aviation register]. We will secure them through a Russian insurance company. 78 machines have been lost,” the Russian minister declared amid a meeting of the Economic Policy Committee of the Federation Council on Tuesday.“We are looking for legal ways to negotiate with lessors and resolve this issue, but so far we have not succeeded. They do not want to negotiate compensation for their payment or a redemption of their property by Russian airlines,” Savelyev elaborated.Earlier, on March 12, the Bermuda Civil Aviation Authority, which previously registered most Russian aircraft, issued a statement notifying that due to international sanctions on Russian aviation, the Bermuda Aircraft Registry is now unable to confidently approve Russian aircraft as being airworthy.“International sanctions on the aviation sector have had a significant impact on the ability to sustain safety oversight on Russian operated aircraft. Therefore, the BCAA has provisionally suspended all Certificates of Airworthiness of those aircraft,” explained the statement.On March 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law making amendments to the Air Code of the Russian Federation. The bill, introduced by the government and aimed at supporting Russia’s transport industry in the face of external sanctions, has allowed Russian air companies to register their leased foreign jets inside the country. The bill has also given them an opportunity to receive domestic airworthiness certificates.However, at least one Russian air carrier, Red Wings, has already made a pledge to return all eight of its leased Airbus planes to their owner. Experts speculate that the company’s decision has to do with the fear that its own jets abroad might be arrested. Red Wings heavily relies on Russia’s domestic Sukhoi Superjet 100 offering.A new round of sanctions against Russia followed the Kremlin’s decision to launch an attack on Ukraine. The operation started on February 24. Soon after, the United States, Canada, and all EU states closed their airspace to Russian jets. Moscow has responded reciprocally. As a part of anti-Russian sanctions, Boeing and Airbus have suspended any maintenance of all aircraft leased by Russian carriers.According to Russian authorities, the sole goal of the restrictions is to hurt the Russian people. President Putin has described anti-Russian sanctions as “a total undisguised aggression” and “a war waged by economic, political, and informational means.”"

We therefore humbly call upon you, the Committee, to consider: Extending and thereby re-opening the nomination procedure for the Nobel Peace Prize until March 31, 2022 to allow for a Nobel Peace Prize nomination for President Zelensky and the people of Ukraine,” says an open letter recently published by EU officials.According to the signatories, Russia launching its military operation in late February constitutes a “historically unprecedented event,” in which “brave Ukrainian men and women are fighting to preserve democracy and self-government.” The EU officials urged the global community to show their support for Ukraine in the face of “this war waged upon them by the Russian Federation.”Nominating President Zelensky for the Nobel Peace Prize now would signify a break with procedure since the deadline for the nomination has passed. “In order for a nomination to be valid, it must be submitted no later than January 31,” explains the Committee’s website. Currently, 343 candidates have been nominated for the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize, out of which 251 are individuals and 92 are organizations.Volodymyr Zelensky was elected the President of Ukraine in 2019. His electoral platform was based on two pillars: fighting corruption and ending the conflict in the Donbass region.According to the Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kiev not only refused to negotiate with the breakaway republics, but prepared for open war against them and against Russia, continuing to bomb civilians, while sending saboteurs and terrorists into Crimea – the peninsula that voted to join Russia after the 2014 US-backed coup in Ukraine.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over disagreements about the implementation of the terms of the Minsk agreements and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

This month saw several other countries – Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia – taking similar steps. Poland has expelled 45 diplomats – almost three quarters of the total size of the diplomatic mission – also on suspicion of espionage.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova made it clear that all “unfounded” expulsions would be met with an “appropriate response” from Moscow."

The embattled presidential son was financially linked to the Ukrainian labs by the Russian military this week.“We will certainly demand explanations. And not us alone. You know that China has asked for explanations, demanded transparency over this program and this situation,” Peskov said. He was commenting on a connection, which the Russian military claimed to have discovered between the embattled son of President Joe Biden and biolabs in Ukraine.Hunter Biden used to head the now-defunct DC-based Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, a branch of the Rosemont Seneca investment fund. The Russian military claimed that the fund had close ties to the Pentagon and helped finance bioresearch in Ukraine.The labs drew public attention after US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said under oath this month that Washington didn’t want research materials from the facilities to fall into the hands of Russia.Washington denied that facilities in Ukraine – and other parts of the world – which the Pentagon funds through its Defense Threat Reduction Agency, had anything to do with germ research. Russia and China complained that the operation was shrouded in secrecy and called on the US to open the labs to international inspections.Peskov dismissed statements coming from the White House, which alleged that Russia was talking about the biolabs to pave the ground for a false flag attack in Ukraine with weapons of mass destruction.“The Americans are trying to switch attention … from the unfolding scandal,” the Russian official assessed.Hunter Biden remains under a broad federal investigation in the US over his shady business practices, the New York Times reported earlier this month. He is suspected of cashing in on his family name while not paying due taxes and failing to register as a foreign agent.His behavior became a campaign issue in 2020, after the New York Post published allegations of personal corruption based on emails recovered from a laptop Hunter left for repair. The story was largely dismissed as a likely Russian plant by the Joe Biden-friendly media and censored by US Big Tech. Investigators from the Department of Justice had confirmed the authenticity of the emails, Times reported."

In exchange, the official said, Turkey could see a “return to [NATO’s] F-35 program and the lifting of sanctions” imposed by Washington.An earlier report from Reuters on Saturday cited three sources as saying that the US had floated the idea to Turkey over the past month. No formal request has been submitted, according to Reuters, which suggested it’s “unlikely” that Turkey would agree to the idea anyway.Ankara and Washington have yet to comment officially on the reports.The Russian-made S-400 missile defense systems have long been the subject of dispute between the US and Turkey. In 2020, Washington imposed sanctions on the Turkish defense industry and kicked the country out of its F-35 fighter jet program over Ankara’s decision to buy the Russian military hardware.Washington has claimed Turkey’s purchase “would endanger the security of US military technology and personnel and provide substantial funds to Russia's defense sector.”Since Russia launched its offensive against Ukraine last month, the US has been working to identify countries which own another air defense system – the Soviet-made S-300s – and figuring out ways to transfer them to Ukraine.One such country, Slovakia, agreed last week to hand over its S-300 systems to Kiev if it was supplied with a substitute from NATO.On Sunday, Slovakia’s Defense Minister Jaroslav Nad confirmed that components of NATO’s Patriot air defense system had begun deployment in his country. He said the system was not a replacement for the S-300 but noted the Soviet system needed to be replaced anyway, due to “age, technical condition, [and] insufficient capabilities.”The Pentagon official who spoke to Sky News Arabia on Sunday said the delivery had arrived in Slovakia “in preparation for Bratislava’s transfer of the S-300 system to Kiev.”Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk.The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

The LV Volt, which was unveiled on Tuesday, was said to be an expression of support for Russia’s attack against Ukraine by symbol-conscious critics.The collection came under fire for using a common symbol of electricity, the lightning bolt, as a motif. Commenters reacting en masse with ‘vomit’ emojis on the brand’s Instagram page apparently believe it to be too similar to the letter ‘Z’.The Russian military has used the letter ‘Z’ to mark combat vehicles used in the offensive against Kiev. Supporters of Ukraine claim this now-tarnished letter of the English alphabet should be treated like the Nazi swastika.In Russia, the letter has been used by some as a sign of support for the government in the face of Western sanctions imposed on the country in retaliation for the military offensive.It is difficult to imagine that Louis Vuitton is secretly supporting the Russian operation. Like dozens of other luxury brands, it has suspended sales of its goods in Russia, shutting down over 100 outlets earlier this month – and presumably, the development of the LV Volt collection required much more than a month.In a similar incident, Elle Russia was accused this week of being pro-war after running headlines about Gen Z on the cover of its March issue."

Konashenkov added that Russian troops were cooperating with units of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) as they advanced towards Nikolskoye. On a separate note, chairman of the Russian Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin has announced that a probe will be carried out to determine whether leaders of the nationalist battalions captured during the operation in the Ukrainian city of Izyum committed any war crimes. Ukrainian nationalist battalions were formed in the aftermath of the West-backed coup in 2014 to wage war against the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR), which declared independence amid fears of oppression of the Russian-speaking population. These battalions largely consisted of members of nationalist and radical groups and were often caught committing war crimes against the local population (including the volunteer ""Donbass"" battalion). The new nationalist-minded authorities largely turned a blind eye to these crimes, failing to prosecute even members of the notorious ""Tornado"" battalion, which was disbanded precisely because of the atrocities it was committing. The war crimes of another notorious battalion, ""Aidar"", were well documented by the Amnesty International non-profit back in 2014, but none of its members were probed and punished for their deeds. The de-Nazification of Ukraine is among the two main declared goals of the Russian special operation, which was started by President Vladimir Putin on 24 February. The operation was launched following a request from the DPR and LPR to protect them against attacks by Ukrainian forces. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

But in no way should this provoke any kind of political reaction from FIDE,” added Peskov, who is also chairman of the board of trustees of the Chess Federation of Russia.  “We call on FIDE to reconsider this decision and remain outside of politics, thereby confirming the international prestige of this international chess organization,” he added. “Of course, we do not agree with such a decision [to ban Karjakin].”Karjakin himself reacted by suggesting that FIDE wanted to deny him the chance to compete at the upcoming Candidates Tournament, where the winner will set up a shot at the world title against Norwegian star Magnus Carlsen.The Chess Federation of Russia has said it will appeal the ban, although Karjakin is not optimistic of success against an organization which is headed by a Russian president, Arkady Dvorkovich.Karjakin contested the world title with Carlsen in New York in 2016, losing a tense battle on tiebreaks after the best-of-12 match had finished level.A former world rapid and blitz chess champion, Karjakin was born in the city of Simferopol in Crimea, and switched to represent Russia in 2009.He was a vocal supporter of the reunification of Crimea with Russia following a 2014 referendum.At the onset of the military operation in Ukraine last month, Karjakin penned an open letter to President Vladimir Putin, thanking him for “fighting for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine with its ruling regime, which has put the security of all of Europe and our country at risk, for the sake of its political goals and ambitions.“I express to you, our commander-in-chief, full support in protecting the interests of Russia, our multinational Russian people, eliminating threats and establishment of peace! I wish you the speedy fulfillment of all the tasks assigned to our valiant army,” added Karjakin.Since Russia began its operation, partly entering Ukraine via Belarus, athletes from the two nations have faced sweeping bans from numerous sports federations following recommendations from the International Olympic Committee (IOC).FIDE has banned Russia and Belarus from any team events “until further notice,” although players from the two countries can compete in a neutral status under the FIDE flag."

Despite repeated calls for India to join in isolating Russia, New Delhi has been reluctant to cut ties with Moscow and even deemed the current situation an opportunity to broaden cooperation.

""We have demonstrated a fair approach that protects and respects the rights of both parties on all platforms where we have a right to vote"", the Turkish president stated. Erdogan expressed hope that if there is progress at the meeting in Istanbul, negotiations between Russia and Ukraine could reach the next stage. Erdogan also emphasised that ""everyone is interested in a ceasefire [in Ukraine] being established as soon as possible"".

Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov has since told a press briefing that the Russian armed forces are continuing their special military operation in Ukraine. The operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 24 February, following a request for assistance from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, which had witnessed weeks of intensifying shelling by the Ukrainian Army. The Russian Defence Ministry emphasised that the operation only targets Ukraine's military infrastructure with high-precision weapons and that civilians are out of danger. "

As Joly weighed in on the new sanctions and weapons supplies Canada was authorising over Russia’s ongoing operation to demilitarise Ukraine, Engler accosted her with the words: After the outburst, the writer was swiftly escorted out by security. Engler later explained his actions on Twitter, saying that he had interrupted the Canadian foreign minister to “challenge the escalation of Canadian violence in Ukraine”. This comes as Joly earlier promised that more economic sanctions are forthcoming against Russian nationals and Russian companies in an effort to further isolate the country. Canada announced on 8 March that it would provide Ukraine with an additional $50m in lethal and non-lethal military aid, including Canadian-made cameras used in military drones and other specialised equipment. Ottawa’s Defence Minister Anita Anand took to Twitter to underscore that Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau would authorise another shipment of highly-specialised military equipment to Ukraine, and added: After Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Justin Trudeau, pleading for more military aid, Canada’s Department of National Defence said in a statement that the weaponry labelled as “lethal aid” would include machine guns, pistols, carbines, sniper rifles, 1.5 million rounds of ammunition, and other small arms equipment. Previously, Canada provided Ukraine with more than $23 million in “non-lethal” military aid that included communications equipment, body armour, and a mobile field hospital. Canada’s decision to pump weaponry into Ukraine echoes the stance of the US and many of its NATO allies, which have labelled Russia's military operation in Ukraine as an “invasion”. Launched on 24 February following a request from the newly-recognised Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, the operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine was a “tough” decision, said Russian President Vladimir Putin, made in order to protect the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbass population, which has faced continued attacks and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years. In response, Washington and dozens of European nations have imposed several batches of sanctions against Russia, targeting its economy, space industry, financial institutions, businesses, etc. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

The supermarket chain boss pointed out that price hikes have been particularly evident when it comes to items such as milk, whose production involves several stages, with the cost of every part of the process rising.He concluded that high food prices were here to stay and that it could be argued that, systematically, “Food has been too cheap for too long.” He said the pressure on chains was “relentless and coming at us from all angles” as they tried to keep prices down.Explaining the ballooning costs, he blamed rising oil prices, worker shortages, and the falling supply of Russian fertilizers and Ukrainian sunflower oil over the past month.Walker suggested that the UK government could implement measures to take the heat off retailers. He urged that the energy price cap on households could be extended to businesses, which he said would translate into some £100m in savings on consumers. He also called on authorities to postpone the introduction of the planned increase in national insurance, as well as some new environmental taxes.Following Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine, which began on February 24, gas and oil prices – a large proportion of which is being supplied to Europe from Russia – have shot up dramatically, resulting in higher energy bills both for individuals and businesses across Europe."

He said Russian troops are isolating key rail stations to cut off military supplies such as fuel and ammunition as well as troops replenishment, which is almost completely interrupted.In a rare update on combat losses, Rudskoy also announced that 1,351 Russian servicemen have died in the hostilities, with another 3,825 injured. Ukraine, meanwhile, claims to have killed some 16,000 Russian troops and destroyed hundreds of tanks, armored vehicles and artillery guns. Though Kiev has not offered casualty estimates for its own soldiers since mid-March – when it said 1,300 had died – the colonel general cited a much larger figure of 30,000 for those both killed and wounded.Thousands of foreign fighters have flocked to the battlefield since Russia sent troops into Ukraine in late February. Some 23,000 volunteers from 37 nations had expressed interest in fighting, Rudskoy said. But Donbass officials refused those offers, he added. Ukrainian officials have offered a similar estimate for its own newly created foreign legion, with Ukrainian Brigadier General Kirill Budanov putting the number at more than 20,000.Russia’s military operation followed a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Moscow’s later recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to regularize the status of the two regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Though Kiev has indicated some willingness to remain outside the US-led military bloc, it insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

It was later clarified that the deviation from the normal rules would be temporary and implemented only on Ukrainian territory, so that the locals could vent their anger over the conflict.The Federal Security Service (FSB) has fully backed the bans, the agency's representative saying in court that the tech giant's actions “were aimed against Russia and its armed forces.” He called on the judge to outlaw the two services and to ""immediately"" implement the decision.The prosecutor acknowledged in court that there are technical means for users to bypass the ruling and still access Facebook and Instagram. However, he assured the court that Russians “won't be held liable for simply using Meta's products.”He had filed a legal complaint demanding that Meta's platforms be outlawed and the company itself designated an extremist organization in Russia, after the rule changes on hate speech. The development prompted Russia to block Instagram, which had 80 million users in the country. Facebook had been made inaccessible earlier, in response to the platform's clampdown accounts belonging to Russian media outlets.The lawsuit doesn't aiming to restrict WhatsApp, another Meta product, due to it being classed as simply a communication tool.During the hearings on Monday, the American firm's lawyers asked the judge to drop or to postpone the proceedings.They argued that the lawsuit shouldn't be handled by a Russian court as Meta is registered in the US and because of this fact the proceedings should be transferred to that jurisdiction. The defense also complained that it wasn't given enough time to properly prepare for the case, which was filed just over a week ago. It also insisted that Meta has ""changed its policy after public discussions and now declares that Russophobia and calls for violence against Russian citizens are unacceptable."""

Both Bidens have dismissed the accusations.,"US House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has blasted Chair of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff for ""lying"" about and ""politicising"" the Hunter Biden laptop story. His statement comes as The New York Times confirmed the existence of the computer, citing people familiar with an ongoing investigation into Hunter. The individuals also authenticated emails and documents on the laptop. Following the NYT report, McCarthy accused his colleague of failing to fulfill his work responsibilities and threatened to remove Schiff from the House Intelligence Committee if the GOP takes back the majority from the Democrats in this year's midterm elections. The House minority leader then went on to criticise the statements Adam Schiff made regarding the Hunter Biden story. On 14 October 2020, less than a month before the 2020 presidential election, the New York Post published an exposé on the second son of Joe Biden. The story was based on a trove of emails and documents it obtained from a laptop purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden. It said Hunter took his computer to an IT store in Delaware, but never returned to collect it. The owner of the store first alerted the FBI about the contents of the laptop.Several emails showed that Joe Biden was seemingly involved in the business dealings of his son in Ukraine during his tenure as vice president of the United States, something the New York Post maintained potentially constituted a conflict of interest. The documents also showed that the younger Biden reportedly used his family's name to benefit himself – he allegedly asked for money from Beijing, promising that his father would improve US policy on China.Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook prevented users from sharing the New York Post's exposé amid its release. The story was branded fake news that could potentially influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential race. Both Bidens declined to comment on the issue.Adam Schiff and other prominent Democrats have called the article a Russian ""smear"". A group of 51 former senior intelligence officials wrote a public letter, saying that the laptop story has ""all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation"" without providing any proof for their hypothesis. After the election, Hunter Biden said that the laptop could have ""absolutely"" belonged to him, but said he never took it to an IT store and suggested the device was perhaps stolen or hacked by Russian intelligence.The president's younger son has since become a subject of investigation into his tax affairs. He is also being probed by the Justice Department about whether he potentially violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act while working with foreign companies. On Friday, the New York Post contacted the 51 former intelligence officials and asked them whether their stance on the Hunter Biden remains the same following the publication of The New York Times' story. Forty-four people declined to comment or didn't respond, two individuals couldn't be reached, and five people said their views on the issue have not changed. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Currently, the US military has crewed aircraft flying in the south and drones over the northern part of the sea. Pulling out was the “prudent” thing to do at the time, Kirby told reporters, “to make it very clear to everybody that the US was not interested in enforcing a conflict by some posture decision that we were making.”Kirby had no information about if, or when, the ships might return, but said that such a decision would be made “in the best interest of our national security and that of our allies and partners.”Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

The campaign to demilitarise Ukraine is taking place via precision strikes against military infrastructure facilities, areas where troop formations have been deployed, including airfields, command posts, arsenals and depots containing weapons and equipment, as well as battles between Ukrainian and Russian forces, Rudskoy said in a briefing Friday. ""At present, the Ukrainian Air Force and the system of air defences have been almost completely destroyed. The country's naval forces have ceased to exist,"" the officer said. Rudskoy warned that Russia would ""not leave unattended"" any attempts to supply Kiev with new aircraft and air defence systems, and warned NATO not to implement a no-fly zone. Ukraine's armed forces have suffered 30,000 losses - 14,000 dead and 16,000 injured during the same period, according to the Main Operations Directorate chief. These losses have affected all 24 groupings of the ground units which existed before the operation began, Rudskoy added. He reminded listeners that Ukraine's armed forces and National Guard formations consisted of 260,200 servicemen before the Russian-led operation began. The grouping of Ukrainian forces fighting in the Donbass against the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Militias has lost more than 7,000 troops, accounting for more than a quarter of its total strength, Rudskoy said. The Russian military has stopped these forces from being replenished by taking control of railway junctions and key roads. The supply of missiles and ammunition, fuel and food to these units has been almost completely stopped, he said, with remaining stockpiles of weapons and fuel in the relevant areas being destroyed in strikes. The Ukrainian military no longer has organised reserve forces available, and losses are being compensated by territorial defence troops who do not have the necessary training, which increases the risk of higher casualties, Rudskoy said. The Main Operations Directorate chief also reported that 113 captured tanks and other armoured vehicles, as well as 138 trophy Javelin and 67 NLAW anti-tank missile systems have been transferred to the Donetsk and Lugansk militias by Russian forces. Russian military intelligence estimates that a total of 6,595 foreign mercenaries and terrorists from 62 countries have been concentrated in Ukraine to date. ""Today, the number of foreign mercenaries is decreasing. This was facilitated by high-precision strikes against bases and camps where they were being trained. Just at Starychi and the Yaroviv base on 13 March, more than 200 were killed and over 400 were injured,"" he said. The officer warned that the rules of warfare do not apply to mercenaries, and that they would be destroyed without mercy. Rudskoy also reported that more than 23,000 foreign nationals from 37 governments have volunteered to fight alongside the DPR and LPR units, but that the republics have rejected their help. ""We proposed to the LPR and DPR leadership that they accept this assistance, but they said they would defend their lands themselves. They have enough forces and means to do so,"" he said. Commenting on the situation in Mariupol, the major south-eastern Ukrainian coastal city which has seen heavy fighting in recent weeks, Rudskoy said that more than 7,000 Ukrainian militants, among them Azov, Aidar and Right Sector neo-Nazi units, are concentrated in the area, taking cover behind civilians whom they use as human shields. The Main Operations Directorate chief said that more than 270 settlements previously controlled by Ukrainian forces are now controlled by Lugansk and Donetsk forces, and that the latter are now operating alongside Russian forces to liberate settlements west of Donetsk. Rudskoy said Ukraine's military created a heavily echeloned, well-fortified defence zone in the Donbass over the past eight years consisting of a ""monolithic"" network of concrete structures, forcing advancing Russian and militia units to conduct heavy strikes against enemy strong points and reserve positions before proceeding to avoid losses. Rudskoy gave his assurance that the Russian military operation in Ukraine will continue until the goals outlined by the Russian president are met. "

I'm worried for the staff there when I see this turmoil.""We've tried to focus on a proposal which align the ownership of the club with long-term investors with a deep history with the club. If you look at the proposal we put forward, keeping it an entirely British finance proposal is core to that.""There are plenty of very successful clubs financed by international investors but in this case, after two decades of exceptional success by the club, the club has the fanbase with the resources to support the club to maintain that success. That's what's very unique about this proposal.""We've looked at the club in the past. There have been occasions where there were rumours of the club being available but ultimately all those projects were shelved.""Our bid is all domestic, we don't have any foreign investors so we're using domestic capital which I think is quite noteworthy. We all attend the matches with our kids.""I don't think any of us are coming purely because we're fans or purely because we love football.""It's really driven by the commercial opportunities. But it is a long-term investment.""Centricus underlined their long-term commitment in a statement looking to ""continued success"" for the Premier League's third-placed team.“The intention is to maintain and support existing management on both the business and sporting operations of the CFC Group,"" they said. ""We intend to maintain the existing strategy direction.""The group said Chelsea had been operating under ""challenging conditions"" and emphasized the importance of a ""smooth and stable ownership transition"" alongside open dialogue.“Centricus would be focused on ensuring that [Chelsea continue] to achieve sporting excellence, high level of community support, transparent governance, financial sustainability, fan engagement and exemplary custodianship,"" they added.Centricus have also pledged to “maintain an elite global brand” while continuing to significantly invest in the Chelsea women's team, the club's highly successful youth academy and its charitable Chelsea Foundation. Chelsea have been for sale since March 2, when Abramovich confirmed his intention to sell six days after Russia's attack on Ukraine began. The businessman was sanctioned in the UK on March 10, with Boris Johnson's Conservative government claiming that Abramovich has direct ties to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.Abramovich has always denied that he has done anything to warrant being punished.The 55-year-old's UK assets – including Chelsea – were frozen and the club was ordered to operate under the terms of a government license.The club wants the government to reconsider the potentially crippling measures, which include a ban on selling tickets and merchandise, agreeing new contracts with players, making signings and spending more than $26,000 on travel to away games.Abramovich is prohibited from profiting from the sale and had already announced that a $2 billion loan to the club was being written off. Several other bids for Chelsea are thought to remain on the table. Major League Baseball side LA Dodgers' part-owner Todd Boehly, the Ricketts family who own rivals Chicago Cubs and British property magnate Nick Candy are involved in some of the potential bids, as are the Saudi Media Group.The government is said to be keen to agree a swift sale subject to the Premier League's ownership tests.""For us, you simply can't buy a club and expect to sell it in five or 10 years,"" said Al-Bassam.""The expectations from the fans, the regulators, be it the FA or Premier League or from the government, would be not to have a sale of this club in the next five or 10 years.""So this would have to be a very, very long-term commitment. The commitment just around either a stadium expansion or a new stadium is a half-decade commitment and that needs to be done in consultation with the community, the council and with fans."""

He posed that the US, in particular, has “very, very ancient leadership” and wondered how leading figures can “stay in touch with the people” if they are separated from most of the population by several generations. According to him, the founders of the country set a minimum age for political leaders, but they did not think of a maximum threshold because they didn't expect people to live that long. Musk said that leaders must be intelligently connected to the majority of country’s population for a democracy to function. Last year, Musk noted that people who hold “very important positions” and make decisions regarding the security of the country should have ""sufficient presence of mind and cognitive abilities.” He also proposed banning people over 70 from running for political office.

In Qatar, one of the world’s largest exporters of liquefied natural gas, Habeck is scheduled to meet with the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and other government officials. On Monday, he is expected to participate in talks with United Arab Emirates ministers.The visit is part of Germany’s efforts to diversify its gas imports as it seeks to reduce its dependency on Russia in the wake of the latest escalation in the conflict with Ukraine.

In the meantime, the Russian information watchdog Roscomnadzor has suspended access to Instagram in the country.

I have no words. He has proven himself a supporter of Putin, and that is completely unacceptable. We completely distance ourselves from that,” Hanus said, according to Norwegian outlet VG.“Bolshunov and others have supported Putin. Watching them in the stadium during the propaganda show... It’s terribly sad to see,” Hanus claimed.Bolshunov, 25, had been among the biggest stars to wear KineteXx gloves, but Hanus said the company had ended its deal with the Russian skiing federation after Moscow launched its military offensive in Ukraine.“Support for Putin and what he’s doing is not okay. We’ve stopped everything and I can’t see any change in that,” Hanus added.Bolshunov is not the only athlete to face Western opprobrium following an appearance at last Friday’s Moscow concert.Double Olympic swimming champion Rylov was dropped by sponsors Speedo, with governing body FINA announcing on Wednesday that they were opening disciplinary proceedings against the star.Rylov had earlier said he would boycott the upcoming World Championships in Budapest in a show of solidarity with banned Russian and Belarusian athletes across other sports, before FINA issued a blanket suspension on swimmers from the two countries on Wednesday."

The original goal of the delegation was reportedly to discuss a UK-India free trade deal, but the objective changed in the context of Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine. The delegates were planning to persuade New Delhi to take a tougher stance towards Moscow, The Guardian says.It was reported that the Indian High Commission changed its decision and raised objections at the last minute. It is unclear whether the Indian officials had issues with individual members of the delegation or were concerned in general about the British Parliament members that sought to persuade the Indian prime minister to take action against Russia, The Guardian reports.On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a phone call with Indian PM Narendra Modi. The two leaders discussed the situation in Ukraine, as Modi called for the end of hostilities and respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty. Modi informed his UK counterpart about India’s humanitarian support, while Johnson said both countries “should intensify efforts to promote peace and de-escalation in the region.” India so far has not imposed sanctions nor denounced Moscow for the military action in Ukraine, and continues to buy Russian oil despite pressure from the international community. India has been reluctant to cut ties with Russia, and is currently discussing mechanisms to switch to ruble-rupee trade.Last week, the UK representatives expressed disappointment over India’s neutral position towards Russia, but expressed hope that its views would change, as the nation continues to be a major trading partner for the UK. On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi arrived in India on an unannounced visit for high-level talks with External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. It was presumed that the talks would center on the geopolitical situation amid the Russian military operation in Ukraine, while India was expected to continue discussions on the China-India territorial dispute in the Ladakh region, the Times of India reported."

The written proposal, which includes Ukraine's pledge to remain a neutral nation and that it will not try to obtain any weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, will be relayed to Putin, he said.Coinciding with Medinsky’s statement to the press, the Russian defense ministry announced it was drastically reducing its military operations in some parts of Ukraine, including near the capital, Kiev. The ministry cited “the talks moving into the practical dimension,” as the reason for the change.Medinsky explained the announcement of a de-escalation on the approaches to Kiev, among other reasons, by the fact that key decision makers are based in the capital.Russia's top negotiator also underlined that there is a difference between de-escalation and ceasefire.“This is not a ceasefire, this is our desire to gradually come to a de-escalation of the conflict, at least in these areas, .... and we understand that there are people in Kiev who need to make decisions,” he said.“We don't want to put this city at additional risk,” Medinsky stressed.David Arakhamia, Medinsky’s opposite number in the Ukrainian delegation, said Kiev had sought a security guarantee from a number of nations that would work not unlike NATO’s mutual self-defense commitment.He named the UK, China, the US, Turkey, France, Canada, Italy, Poland and Israel as possible guarantors, and claimed some of them have given their preliminary agreement to serve in that capacity.The proposed security pledge will not apply to the parts of Ukraine whose status remains in dispute, Arakhamia said. These include Crimea, which Russia considers its territory, and the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, which Russia recognized as sovereign states and whose forces are taking part in ongoing hostilities.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu remarked that he hoped that the outcome of the negotiation would soon lead to a ceasefire and a sustainable political resolution of the crisis.Last month, Russia launched a military attack on Ukraine over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Kiev says the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

At the same time, the president noted that Serbia had experienced being attacked by foreign powers, bearing in mind the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. On 24 March, a rally under the slogan ""We are against NATO"" took place in Serbia. Demonstrators recalled the beginning of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia 23 years ago. Earlier in March, the Serbian government supported 4 of the 13 points of a UN resolution condemning Russia's special military operation in Ukraine. All of those points did not imply the introduction of sanctions against Moscow. In 1999, an armed confrontation between Albanian separatists from the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian Army led to the bombing of what was then the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, by NATO forces. The operation was undertaken without the approval of the UN Security Council and was based on allegations by Western countries that the Yugoslav authorities were allegedly carrying out ethnic cleansing of Kosovo Albanians. NATO airstrikes continued from 24 March to 10 June 1999 and claimed the lives of over 2,500 people, including 87 children. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

The plan was rejected by the EU and G7 earlier on Tuesday.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that Russia would not supply natural gas to the European market for free, as euros and dollars would not be accepted from March 31.Russia’s list of “unfriendly states,” which initially included just two countries – the US and the Czech Republic – was significantly expanded in March in the wake of the unprecedented economic sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West. Now it includes all EU members, Ukraine, the UK, Canada, Japan, and others – nations which have condemned Russia’s offensive in Ukraine.All of these countries are now subject to various retaliation measures, restrictions, and specific requirements from Russia. Another retaliatory initiative saw the Finance Ministry requesting that Russian companies that want to work with firms from countries on the list receive government permission first.On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that citizens of “unfriendly states” would soon be hit by visa sanctions restricting entry to the country."

He made a direct appeal to the Russian people during a speech in Warsaw, where he had met for talks with high-ranking Ukrainian officials on Saturday.“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden declared at the end of an emotionally overwrought speech in the Polish capital’s Royal Castle. While he has previously denounced Putin as a “war criminal” and a “dictator,” and lobbed at him all manner of other geopolitical insults, this was his first recorded demand that the president be removed from office.""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" Biden says of Vladimir Putin. pic.twitter.com/9QY9QidUZSBiden also spoke directly to “the Russian people,” insisting that despite weeks of punishing sanctions and forcing hundreds of American and European-based companies to pull out of the country, “you, the Russian people, are not our enemy.”He then attempted to liken Ukrainians fighting “Russian aggression” to the Soviet Union defending itself from Nazi Germany in World War II. A comparison which ignores how the modern Ukrainian state regards Nazi collaborators of that era, such as Stepan Bandera, as national heroes. Biden spoke more sternly to Russian leaders, warning them not to “even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory,” due to the “sacred obligation” the alliance has under Article 5, its mutual defense treaty. Moscow has never indicted that it has any “American forces are in Europe — not in Europe—” the president began, correcting himself, “to engage in conflict with Russian forces.” Biden warned 100,000 American troops were waiting to defend Washington’s European allies.The president warned NATO and its allies that the posturing against Russia “would not be easy, there will be costs, but it’s a price we have to pay,” before waxing poetic about the “flame of liberty” chasing off the “darkness that drives autocracy.”Not one to miss an opportunity, Biden cited Europe’s dependence on Russian oil and gas as motivation to move toward green energy. Fuel prices in Europe and to a lesser extent the US have soared in the wake of sanctions placed on Russian oil and gas.Speaking later, a White House official clarified that Biden was not calling for regime change in Russia when he made his remarks. ""The President's point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region. He was not discussing Putin's power in Russia, or regime change,"" they said."

The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocols were designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Another goal of the military operation is to “denazify” the country, according to Moscow. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."

The arts are collateral damage and it’s impossible to speculate how that will play out,” Baryshnikov said.The dancer, along with a number of other prominent emigrants, has launched a crowdfunding project dubbed “True Russia,” aiming to spread a better understanding of Russian culture. Money raised from the campaign will be distributed among charities helping Ukrainian refugees.Moscow launched a large-scale assault against its neighboring country in late February following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to regularize the status of the breakaway regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev says the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two rebel republics by force."

It turns out that, as the US moves to lift sanctions on that nation by rejoining the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), global energy security is more important than the much-hyped Iranian nuclear threat.It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or a Republican, when it comes to using economic sanctions as a weapon, politics don’t matter. The case of Iran and its nuclear program stands out as a clear example of this. Under the administrations of Republican President George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama alike, the US used the alleged threat posed by that program – claimed by the US to be military in nature, but to be used for exclusively peaceful purposes by Iran – as justification to impose stringent economic sanctions ostensibly designed to compel the Iranian government to cease its acquisition and use of uranium enrichment technology.Ultimately, this policy failed in the face of Iran’s refusal to yield on the issue of its rights under the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to pursue a peaceful nuclear energy program inclusive of the entire nuclear fuel cycle. By building a case for sanctions as the only alternative to military action to remove the alleged threat posed by the program, the US had boxed itself into a corner where, when sanctions had demonstrably failed, the only choice left was one the US was in no position to make.This is the true background to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the JCPOA. It wasn’t US sanctions that brought Tehran to the negotiating table. In fact, it was the failure of these sanctions that forced the US to back down from its previous policy position, which was intolerant of all Iranian uranium enrichment capability. For Iran, the JCPOA was a win-win situation: it was able to retain its uranium enrichment program, albeit with significant temporary restrictions and under strict monitoring from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which employed an intrusive on-site inspection regimen, as well as to have US and international sanctions lifted.The respite of a sanctions-free existence for Iran, however, was short-lived. There were two realities hard-wired into the JCPOA, which, from an American perspective, always doomed the agreement from being successfully brought to term. First and foremost were the so-called “sunset clauses” which placed stringent restrictions on the scope and scale of Iran’s uranium enrichment program, including limitations on the number and quality of the centrifuges it could use in this effort. As the JCPOA matured, these clauses would eventually be lifted, allowing Iran to install more efficient centrifuges in greater numbers.Given the stated purpose of the JCPOA was to deny Iran a so-called “breakout” capability (defined as the period needed by Iran to produce enough fissile material for the production of a single nuclear device should all restrictions be removed) of less than one year, it was clear that once the sunset clauses were lifted, this breakout calculation would diminish significantly, to a period of months or even weeks. Herein lay the poison pill of the deal: the US continued to maintain that Iran had been operating a nuclear weapons program that had been mothballed in 2003, but which had never been declared by Iran and, as such, had continued to exist.If one accepts this narrative at face value – Iran denies having ever had such a program, and the IAEA has not been able to prove that one had ever existed – then the expiration of the sunset clauses would put Iran on a fast track toward acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. This was the logic that underpinned Obama’s admission, made in April 2015 during an interview with the US broadcaster NPR, that the US would “reconsider” the viability of the JCPOA as an instrument of US policy on the eve of the clauses expiring. In short, the JCPOA was simply a place-holder, designed to buy the US time to find a way to convince Iran to give up the very thing the deal enshrined: its uranium enrichment program.The other fatal flaw of the JCPOA was that, from an American perspective, it lacked the strength of a formal treaty. Unable to get Senate ratification of the deal, Obama enacted it through his inherent executive powers, which meant that any successive administration could simply revoke the relevant executive order and the JCPOA would, from the US perspective, be no more.This is precisely what happened when Donald Trump was elected president. In little over a year, citing Israeli intelligence that Iran had an undeclared nuclear weapons program, and highlighting the risk of allowing Iran access to the technologies it would lawfully be able to possess once the sunset clauses expired, Trump simply withdrew from the JCPOA, instituting a policy of “maximum pressure” through stringent economic sanctions that specifically targeted Iran’s energy sector. Citing the hand-in-glove relationship between the Iranian economy and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the Trump administration labeled that entity a terrorist organization, opening it up to targeted sanctions.The decision to leave the JCPOA was not well received by either Iran or the other members of the agreement (Russia, China, France, the UK, Germany, and the European Union). Neither was the US policy of maximum pressure against Iran, which employed so-called “secondary sanctions” against any nation or company that did business with Iran. The tension the policy caused regarding US relations with its European allies, combined with the deterioration of security in the Persian Gulf region, prompted the administration of President Joe Biden to commit to rejoining the JCPOA as soon as possible after coming to power in early 2021.The negotiations between the US and the remaining parties to the Iran nuclear deal have been going on for nearly a year now. What should have been little more than the signing of an executive order undoing the actions of the Trump administration turned into a veritable effort by the Biden administration to renegotiate the JCPOA that, among other things, extended the timeframe of the “sunset clauses” and retained the non-permanent characteristic of US participation, i.e., no binding treaty, but merely a renewal of executive powers that could at any time be rescinded.By the fall of 2021, the negotiations had got bogged down, with many observers questioning whether a deal could be reached at all. And then came Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine.Overnight, the subterfuge of US concern over Iran’s nuclear capability dissolved in the face of brutal economic reality driven by the US-led effort to sanction Russia, inclusive of its oil and gas energy sector. Concerns about global oil supplies suddenly made Iranian oil, which the US had tried to block from the world market through sanctions, an invaluable geopolitical asset. The need to get that oil into the global energy supply chain had the effect of eliminating most if not all the objections the US had been raising regarding JCPOA renewal. The US has even sweetened the potby reportedly being open to revoking the “terrorist” label from the IRGC. And, in a final display of fecklessness, it has agreed to Russia’s demands that any economic interaction between Moscow and Tehran protected by the JCPOA cannot be subject to the US-led sanctioning of Russia because of its Ukrainian operations.This still leaves the temporary status of any US commitment to the Iran deal on the table. This, however, is non-negotiable—there is simply no way Biden would be able to get the JCPOA in its original form through the Senate ratification process. Iran and the other parties to the agreement should have no illusions about any US commitments in this regard. There will come a time in the not-so-distant future when an American president, whether he/she is a Democrat or a Republican, will be compelled, for domestic political reasons, to withdraw from the JCPOA once again. The inconsistencies inherent in the US policy formulation – that Iran has an undeclared nuclear weapons program that would be accelerated once the sunset clauses of the JCPOA expire – demand as much.That this reasoning is purely political in nature, however, has been exposed by how quickly the Biden administration rushed to finalize a renewal of the JCPOA. Apparently, creating the conditions to keep the price of gasoline down at the pumps in the lead-up to the midterm elections later this year trumps any genuine concern about the threat posed to international peace and security by a rejuvenated Iranian uranium enrichment program."

It said it had posed a threat to UK national security, and the defense secretary’s words had been “modified and edited” to show him saying something he had never said.Vovan and Lexus, whose real names are Vladimir Kuznetsov and Aleksey Stolyarov, have on several occasions been accused of working with the Kremlin, or other branches of the Russian state. They have always denied this and have consistently claimed their work is purely media in nature. In the video of the call published by the pranksters, the unsuspecting Wallace was asked if London would be willing to help Kiev restart its military nuclear program. He responded, “Russia will really hate it,” and assured the caller that “the principle is [this]: we will support Ukraine as our friend in the choices you make.”He added that the British military was running out of mobile anti-tank missiles due to having supplied such a volume to Ukraine amid its conflict with Russia.Patel was also tricked by Vovan and Lexus, telling them those in power in Russia were “barbarians,” and promising the Home Office would step up its spying on Russian nationals in the UK.Kuznetsov and Stolyarov have had a presence on YouTube for years, pranking numerous high-profile politicians and celebrities during that time, including Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the then-Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris, Prince Harry, and Elton John."

Kiev and the self-proclaimed republics in the Donbass region, where the plane was shot down, have blamed each other for the incident. The investigation into the MH17 crash was conducted by Dutch prosecutors and the Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT). The international group of investigators claims that the plane was downed by a Buk missile belonging to the Russian armed forces, something Moscow denies. Russia was excluded from the joint probe, but conducted its own investigation and said it had provided the JIT with evidence, including radar data, showing that the plane had been shot down by a Ukrainian Buk missile.

On Monday, the US Ambassador in Moscow, John Sullivan, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and “was handed a note of protest” over Biden’s “unacceptable” statements.Statements such as these from a US president are “unworthy of a statesman of such a high rank” and have brought US-Russia relations to “the brink of collapse,” the ministry said in a statement on Monday.“Hostile actions taken against Russia” will be met with “a decisive and firm rebuff,” it added.The Foreign Ministry also issued a call on the US to ensure “normal working conditions for Russian diplomatic missions in the United States, including guarantees for their uninterrupted functioning.”The note of protest came a few days after Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov commented on the “personal insults” to Putin. Peskov said this rhetoric is “unacceptable and unforgivable” from the president of a state “whose bombs killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world.”The Kremlin spokesperson later said that Biden’s “irritability” and “forgetfulness” was leading to “aggressive statements.”Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

Energy has become an important pillar of India's special and privileged relationship with Russia during the Narendra Modi era.","India has brushed aside US warnings against energy ties with Russia amid the ongoing military operation in Ukraine.  Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has categorically stated that if Western energy firms vacate the Russian market, New Delhi will not hesitate to take advantage of the opportunity. The oil minister, who spoke with Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak on 12 March on energy matters, replied to parliamentarians wondering if there would be diplomatic and economic ramifications if India increased energy investments in Russia. New Delhi sees rising opportunities in Russia at discounted rates as Shell, British Petroleum, ExxonMobil, and several others responded to Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine by exiting their investments worth around $30 billion from Russian energy fields. India's public sector units — ONGC Videsh Ltd, Indian Oil Ltd, Bharat Petro Resources Ltd, Oil India Ltd -- have invested over $16 billion in oil and gas fields such as Sakhalin-1, Imperial Energy, Vankorneft, TaasYuryakh, and License-61 since the early 2000s.  Russian entities, including Rosneft, own a majority stake in the Indian refiner Nayara Energy. The Indian minister said that some of those Indian investments are very profitable. Using the Sakhalin-1 project as an example, the minister said that the Indian firm ONGC Videsh Ltd has earned over $3.7 billion with a 20% investment of $337 million two decades ago. ExxonMobil operates the Sakhalin-1 project on behalf of an international consortium of Japanese, Indian, and Russian companies.  ""In response to recent events, we are beginning the process to discontinue operations and developing steps to exit the Sakhalin-1 venture"", the Texas-based ExxonMobil said on 1 March. The BJP politician, however, underlined that the media reports about Western firms already withdrawing their investments from Russian energy fields are not authentic. The minister assured the parliamentarian that there would be no adverse impact on hydrocarbon energy agreements with Russia. India's top refiner, Indian Oil, signed an agreement to purchase 3 million barrels of crude oil from Russia this month.  Although India buying Russian oil wouldn't violate US sanctions against Moscow, the Indian government has planned payment in national currencies to continue trade in other commodities. The US has imposed sanctions on several Russian financial institutions. When asked if rupee-ruble transactions will harm New Delhi's relationship with Washington, Minister Puri responded to parliamentarians by saying that India and the US have a robust bilateral energy partnership that will continue to grow. The minister said that energy imports from the US are around $13.5 billion, including $10 billion in crude oil. ""As far as oil imports from Russia are concerned, contrary to what is being played up in the press, these are minuscule"", Puri said. Indian oil and gas public sector undertakings imported approximately less than one percent of its total crude oil imports from Russia in 2021-2022 (April 2021 to January 2022). On 15 March, when a reporter asked about India's decision to buy discounted Russian oil, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the US message to ""any country"" is to ""think about where you want to stand when the history books are written"". Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a special military operation in the Eastern European country on 24 February at the request of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. President Putin stressed that the operation was started to stop the eight-year-long atrocities by Kiev in Donbass, adding that Russia's goal is the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine.

The country’s economy minister Robert Habeck said earlier that Berlin will be able to cut reliance on Russian oil and coal by the end of 2022 but giving up on gas won’t be that easy.According to Habeck, at least two LNG terminals will be built to help reduce Germany’s dependence on it. Berlin plans to turn to Qatar and the US to compensate for Russian gas despite it being a more expensive option."

In a statement on Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry expressed “a resolute protest against [the] prevocational, unjustified actions” of these countries.The ongoing diplomatic war between the West and Moscow has significantly intensified in the wake of Russia’s military attack on Ukraine, leading to a number of European countries expelling Russian envoys.“Based on the principle of reciprocity,” Russia has expelled four employees of the Embassy of Lithuania and three of the Embassy of Latvia, as well as three representatives of Estonia, both from Moscow and Saint Petersburg.“They are ordered to leave the territory of the Russian Federation in the same time frames that were set aside for the departure of employees of the Russian diplomatic missions in the Baltic countries,” the ministry said. On March 18, three Baltic countries declared several Russian diplomats persona non grata, accusing them of actions that allegedly violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, as well as of “spreading disinformation, poised to justify Russia’s military actions.”The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to the announcements by saying that “all groundless expulsions of Russian diplomats will be met with an appropriate response.” Despite this warning, Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs Edgars Rinkevics said that Russian authorities expelled his country’s diplomats “unjustifiably.”The new expulsions came a day after Russia ordered three Slovak diplomats to leave Moscow within 72 hours – in response to the expulsion of the same number of Russian diplomats by that country.This month saw several other countries taking similar steps. Poland has expelled 45 diplomats – almost three quarters of the total size of the diplomatic mission – also on suspicion of espionage. On Tuesday, Belgium, Ireland, and the Netherlands all announced the expulsion of over 40 Russian diplomats from their countries combined."

In the weeks leading up to the crisis, French President Emmanuel Macron held a series of back-and-forth talks with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts in an apparent attempt to defuse tensions.","The chief of France's Main Directorate of Military Intelligence, General Eric Vidaud has resigned. An informed source at the Ministry of the Armed Forces told L’Opinion that Vidaud was set to be sacked in the summer over “French shortcomings” regarding the crisis in Ukraine, but chose to quit immediately instead. Vidaud’s sacking is reportedly related to a “lack of understanding of the issues” and “insufficient briefings”. BMFTV and other French outlets have subsequently confirmed L’Opinion’s reporting of Vidaud’s departure. A diplomatic source cited by AFP defended the general, who was put in his post in the autumn of 2021, saying his agency was responsible for “military intelligence on operations, not intentionality”. The source said Russia was deemed not to have the means to launch a full-scale operation in Ukraine, and that “what happened proves him right”. Before his appointment to the Main Directorate of Military Intelligence, Vidaud served as head of French Special Operations Command – the body responsible for coordinating the missions of French special forces units. Vidaud’s resignation follows comments made to Le Monde by Thierry Burkhard, chief of defence staff of France’s armed forces, that French military intelligence failed in its assessment of the “Russian threat” to Ukraine. Criticism of Vidaud’s performance has not been limited to Ukraine. Last year, after the United States and Britain pulled the rug out from underneath a French submarine contract with Australia worth $65 billion, French military intelligence and other agencies were lambasted for failing to predict the loss of the contract. Brigadier General Jacques de Montgros, who presently commands the European Union’s training mission in the Central African Republic, is expected to replace Vidaud, according to L’Opinion’s information. President Emmanuel Macron and Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian have sought to prevent the crisis in relations between the West and Russia over Ukraine from spiraling any further out of control. Earlier this week, after US President Joe Biden called for regime change in Russia and dubbed Vladimir Putin a “butcher”, Macron said he “would not use those words” and called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. “If we want to do that, we can’t escalate either in words or action,” he said. French opposition have criticised the Elysee Palace over its weapons deliveries to Ukraine, with National Rally leader Marine Le Pen calling on Europe to stick to diplomacy instead. Putin and Macron have spoken repeatedly since Russia began its military operation in Ukraine. On Wednesday, the Russian president briefed his French counterpart on measures to provide humanitarian aid and to evacuate civilians from the conflict zone, and told him that Ukraine’s nationalist fighters would need to lay down their arms to resolve the crisis in Mariupol.

The goal of the operation is to demilitarise and de-Nazify the country.","The town of Volnovakha in the Donetsk region will have to be rebuilt because most of its houses cannot be restored after heavy fighting, during which Ukrainian troops installed firing points in residential areas, Alexander Kachanov, head of the administration of the nearby town of Dokuchayevsk, has told Sputnik. Kachanov said that he had been tasked with rebuilding Volnovakha by Denis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). “The town has totally been ruined. Of the buildings that we have already examined, 85 percent cannot be reconstructed”, the head of Dokuchayevsk’s administration said. Kachanov spoke a few weeks after Volnovakha was cleared of Ukrainian troops by DPR forces in the course of the ongoing Russian special operation in Ukraine. The operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 24 February, following a request for help from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, which had seen weeks of intensifying shelling by the Ukrainian Army.  The Kremlin has repeatedly stressed that it does not plan to occupy Ukraine, with the Russian Defence Ministry stating that the operation only aims to destroy Ukrainian military infrastructure with high-precision weapons that don’t pose a threat to civilians. In the latest development, Russia’s Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on Monday that at least 1,506 tanks, 152 multiple rocket launchers, and 592 field artillery pieces and mortars had already been destroyed by Russian forces.

Sofia said it will not renew the contract with Moscow in light of its military campaign against Ukraine.“It’s important to us that Bulgaria doesn’t interrupt the operation of the pipeline,” Vucic said on Sunday, adding that his country is paying for transit.“We’re saying that we want the Russian gas from the TurkStream pipeline, so let us take it, we’re paying for it. And what you do is your business, and what you want is your business, we have no issue with it.”The president added that he was not sure it would be “that easy” for Bulgaria to stop gas imports from Russia.Vucic previously said that shutting the pipeline down would be “a complete disaster.” The Balkan Stream, a section of the TurkStream that runs through Serbia, was launched just last year.Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Assen Vassilev said on Saturday that the country would not renew its gas contract with Moscow. “During the next [few] weeks there will be discussions, at a European level, for a common gas contract for the entire European Union. We expect this mechanism to start functioning in the summer,” Vassilev said, adding that there were “alternatives” to buying gas from the Russian company Gazprom.Bulgaria began receiving gas from Azerbaijan in 2021. Ivan Topchiyski, the chairman of Bulgargaz’s board of directors, said that Sofia was in talks to increase supplies from Baku.Many countries, including the US, UK, EU member states, and Canada, imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia following its attack on Ukraine on February 24.Moscow attacked its neighbor following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

Nevertheless, the devil is, as usual, in the details.""As Hon’ble Members would be aware, the tense situation between Russia and Ukraine erupted into conflict on 24 February 2022. The root causes for this are complex, going back to range of issues including the security architecture, political governance and inter-state politics. To that was added the challenges of implementing understandings reached earlier. What is pertinent to note is that the hostilities placed the Indian community of 20,000 plus in direct danger. Even while we were participating in the global deliberations of this evolving situation in the UN Security Council, the pressing challenge was to safeguard our citizens and ensure that they were not in harm’s way"", said Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in his address to the upper-chamber of the Indian Parliament (Rajya Sabha) on March 15, 2022.Thus, it is not the changing geopolitical equilibrium or arguments over India’s stance on the conflict but the evacuation of the Indian community in Ukraine, most of whom pursued medical studies in Kiev, Kharkov and Sumy, that in fact most seemed to bother the nation’s leadership.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government launched ""Operation Ganga"", the aim of which was to return Indian nationals home. The exercise entailed a ""whole of Government"" approach and joint efforts undertaken by the Ministry of External Affairs with all the Embassies concerned, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Defence, the National Disaster Response Force, Indian Air Force and private airlines. What should be mentioned is that the Russian political leadership and the military on the ground were in constant contact with New Delhi's officials and succeeded in providing Indian students and professionals with humanitarian passage.Unfortunately, a final year medical student of Kharkiv Medical University Naveen Shekarappa Gyanagaudar lost his life. That tragedy requires a deep investigation, which Russia immediately promised to conduct. However, ""Operation Ganga"" has eventually been undertaken successfully, with the close India-Russia interaction in a tough situation having served as another example of mutual understanding in resolving urgent issues.Although the Indian leadership, and public in general, obviously concentrated on the humanitarian dimension of the conflict, more pragmatic considerations have been in place. These considerations concern India’s positioning in the international arena (including such venues as the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly) and speculation about the mounting number of sanctions imposed on Russia by the West as well as the ways to face the future ramifications for India-Russia cooperation, engendered by those constraints.Hardly anyone in Russia expected India to fail its historical ally in such circumstances. And it didn’t. New Delhi’s position during the vote on the resolutions condemning Russia’s actions in the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly respectively has been steadfast and coherent – India abstained from taking part in West-sponsored resolutions that sought to deplore in the ""strongest terms"" Russia's ""aggression"" against Ukraine.Hence, India remains committed to its strategic culture, expressed most clearly in the principle of ""multialignment"" (a reference to the earlier principle of non-alignment), where the emerging world power persists in seeking ground for fruitful cooperation with all nations and avoids taking a stand on controversial issues. India proved its traditionally independent stance and should have dissuaded those political pundits who mistakenly regarded its historically weighted position, as an inclination to bolster its ties with the West at the expense of New Delhi and Moscow's bilateral relations.Economic cooperation seems to be a rather complicated issue, as it requires handling multiple structural constraints stemming from the very nature of the interconnected global markets. Operating in this environment entails the elaboration of coherent and consistent strategies, responding to the newly emerged challenges.Indian decision-makers in the economic field, as well as business circles, pay close attention to the Western sanction policies, the mass media provides detailed information about the measures undertaken by the Bank of Russia, the ruble exchange rate and the functioning of the Russian financial markets.What disturbs them most is possible structural problems in the world economy and the global network of supply chains. For instance, the Reserve Bank of India (acting as the country's central bank) has expressed concern about the impact of economic sanctions on the dynamics of energy prices, volatility in the financial markets and inflation rates.Indian market players themselves are unwilling to join the Western-led sanction campaign but are wary of repercussions deriving from further cooperation with Russia. That is why the State Bank of India (the nation’s top lender) has stopped processing any transactions involving Russian entities which are subject to international sanctions imposed on Moscow due to its significant international presence and the need to comply with US and EU regulations.However, it's no surprise that some notable economic agents should have acted in line with Western initiatives so as not to endanger India’s long-term plans on attracting investments and advanced businesses from around the world. It is of Russia’s interest to have relations with a rapidly developing economy with the steps undertaken by the SBI being of marginal importance in the whole context of India-Russia economic ties.One may wonder what interests India could pursue in the current situation? First of all, New Delhi has another chance to take advantage of the Russian pivot to the East, since this time Moscow has no option but to finally embark on boosting its ties with the non-Western world in practice. While Russia and Europe are strongly interconnected from geostrategic perspective, and that is why they are doomed to restore European security architecture and find consensus on other fields of cooperation, nowadays there is a room for both reaffirming historical commitments and exploring new spheres of partnership in order to make it comprehensive in full effect.Secondly, it is high time India took real steps to lessen the so-called ""Russia’s dependence on China"". This narrative of ""Russia rapidly becoming subordinate to China"" has been circulating around Indian official, academic, expert and media circles in recent years. There is unlikely to be a better chance for New Delhi to enter the game decisively by establishing new businesses, launching joint projects and increasing investments so as to pick up its desired winnings.Finally, India could demonstrate that despite being under tough pressure from the West, and primarily from the US, it is ready to take advantage of its special privileges in its partnership with Russia. There will be no better argument in fighting back against speculation within some circles in Moscow that India is gradually tilting towards the West. The environment we will have to operate in is, no doubt, uncertain. However, it is quite clear that for today Russia should be satisfied with the stand India took in the crisis. The interaction between Moscow and New Delhi outweighs thousands of supportive words and statements.India and Russia are going to further interact within a new international order since the old one does not seem to work anymore. The way it will look depends on the political will of the leadership of the two nations and  the motivation of both Indian and Russian entrepreneurs. "

On March 16, it also revoked Russia’s “most favored nation” trade status. Moscow and Tokyo never formally concluded a peace treaty after the Second World War, due to the dispute over the four southernmost islands in the Kuril chain, which Japan calls its “Northern Territories.”Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan, and Habomai were administered by Japan between 1855 and 1945, when the Soviet Union took possession of them due to Tokyo’s unconditional surrender to the Allies.Russia and Japan signed a visa-free agreement for Japanese travel to the four islands in 1991, and, in 1999, added a protocol to facilitate the visits of former Japanese residents of the islands.Talks between Moscow and Tokyo on resolving the territorial dispute resumed in 2018, but Japan has maintained that its right to the four islands is not negotiable."

But I think you have to have a much better conversation with the rest of the global community,” he added.Qatar and Saudi Arabia are considered strategic allies of the West, with the US having recently awarded the former the status of “major non-NATO ally.” The two wealthy Gulf nations have so far maintained a neutral stance on the situation in Ukraine due to their ties with Russia.Washington and Brussels are hoping Doha and Riyadh will boost their oil and gas production to reduce the West’s dependence on Russian energy.In an interview with CNN earlier this week, however, Qatari Energy Minister Saad Sherida al-Kaabi said replacing Russian gas was “not practically possible.” He stated that Doha would not be imposing sanctions on Russia’s oil and gas sector as “energy should stay out of politics.”Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine a month ago, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

Open dialog is crucial, especially during times of tension, especially during times of conflict,” Price told reporters at a regular State Department press conference in Washington. “We have sought to maintain a diplomatic presence in Moscow [and] we have sought for the Russians to be able to continue to maintain a diplomatic presence in the US,” he added.Price also pointed to the setting up of “deconfliction channels on a tactical level with Moscow” as proof that the US and Russia would remain in contact despite Washington’s efforts to isolate Moscow on the global stage.Price’s comments were made hours after Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned US ambassador John Sullivan to warn him that relations between the US and Russia were “on the brink of collapse” over “unacceptable” statements by Biden.Biden last week called Putin a “murderer” and a “war criminal,” with Secretary of State Tony Blinken echoing the “war criminal” charge in statements of his own. Moscow said that such statements were “unworthy of a statesman of such a high rank.”While Russia's public telling-off of Sullivan marks its official response to Biden’s statements, the Kremlin has already responded informally, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that Biden’s rhetoric was “unacceptable and unforgivable” from the president of a state “whose bombs killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world.”The Kremlin spokesperson later added that Biden’s “irritability” and “forgetfulness” were contributing to such “aggressive statements.”While the Biden administration has refused to intervene militarily in the ongoing Russia/Ukraine war, Washington has funnelled arms and ammunition to Kiev, and earmarked billions of dollars for future weapons shipments to Ukraine. The US has also imposed crippling economic sanctions on Russia, which Moscow has described as “economic warfare,” and Biden said were explicitly designed to “crater” the Russian economy.Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

The comments were made by Sitaram Yechury, general-secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M), during a press conference in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir. He was visiting Kashmir for his party's 12th state conference. ""We agree with Russia when it says that the war in Ukraine is actually a war between Russia, the US and NATO. Ukraine has become its unfortunate theatre,"" said Yechury, referring to Russia's ongoing military operation in Ukraine. The CPI-M has also said NATO has gone back on promises it once made to the former USSR president, Mikhail Gorbachev, that there would be no eastward expansion of NATO. Yechury also argued that, despite the fact that Georgia and Ukraine are not NATO members, ""in both of these countries, NATO has developed a complete infrastructure. And today 175,000 NATO combat troops are posted on the ground near the Ukraine-Russia border even before the war."" Commenting on how to get out of the Ukrainian crisis, Yechury said that his party wants the crisis to be resolved through talks. However, he termed India's foreign policy of becoming subservient to interests of the United States. ""India is completely aligned with American foreign policy. The Modi government is involved in the American strategic and military alliances whether it's the QUAD or Indo-Pacific or regional joint military exercises or defence acquisitions – their relationship has been cemented,"" Yechury claimed. He said India has been reduced to become a junior partner of the USA’s global strategic team. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February in an effort to de-Nazify the country. So far India has abstained from voting in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) twice, and in the UN General Assembly once over resolutions regarding the Russian military operation. The steps included abstention from a UN resolution that attempted to label Russia the “aggressor” in the ongoing crisis. The CPI-M also adopted a resolution in Srinagar targeting various of the policies propounded by the federal government, led by the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). The party demanded an early hearing of a petition in the Indian Supreme Court challenging the withdrawal of Jammu and Kashmir's special status in August 2019. The party, in its resolution, also alleged that journalists in Kashmir working for ""different media outlets face intimidation and harassment"". Weighing in on the ongoing discussion of a Bollywood film titled, 'Kashmir Files', the resolution stated ""promoting Kashmir Files is an attempt to polarise the people further"".

It doesn't work in other ways.“Chess has always been a special sport for me! Chess is a sport for the elite, so I said and thought. Chess is a great game!“And FIDE, with its policy, destroyed this exclusivity and sublimity of chess. Mixing chess with dirt and hypocrisy!“It’s a pity that the International Chess Federation has dishonored chess so much!”A post shared by Sergey Karjakin (@sergey_karjakin)Karjakin himself responded to the decision on Monday by suggesting it was a cynical attempt to prevent him from appearing at the upcoming Candidates Tournament, where the opportunity will be on offer to set up a world title clash with Norwegian great Magnus Carlsen.Karjakin met Carlsen in a world championship clash in New York in 2016, losing to the Norwegian in a series of tense tiebreaks after the best-of-12 match ended in a tie.The Chess Federation of Russia has vowed it will appeal Karjakin’s ban, although the chess star has expressed doubts that the bid will be successful.A former world rapid and blitz chess champion, Karjakin has been vocal in his support for Russia throughout its actions in Crimea and Ukraine.Karjakin was born in the city of Simferopol in Crimea and represented Ukraine before switching to Russia in 2009. He vehemently backed Crimean reunification with Russia after the referendum of 2014 in the region.As Moscow launched its military operation in Donbass and Ukraine last month, Karjakin penned an open letter to President Putin, saying “[Russia] is fighting for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine with its ruling regime, which has put the security of all of Europe and our country at risk, for the sake of its political goals and ambitions…“I express to you, our commander-in-chief, full support in protecting the interests of Russia, our multinational Russian people, eliminating threats and establishment of peace! I wish you the speedy fulfillment of all the tasks assigned to our valiant army,” added the star.Karjakin recently said on social media that he and his family had received death threats because of his stance.

Noting how Biden, for example, appeared to suggest that US soldiers “will soon be on the ground in Ukraine”, how he forgot the name of the US Secretary of Defense, and how he said that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”, Hannity described the US head of state as a “walking, talking liability” to the United States and to the world. He also pointed out how Biden’s staffers provide the US president with “daily cheat sheets featuring one sentence answers to the most simple, the most basic questions about Joe’s own policies”. “Ask yourself what kind president needs a note card to answer a basic and predictable question?” Hannity inquired. During his recent visit to Poland and addressing the US troops stationed in the country, Biden made remarks that were regarded by some as revealing the United States' plans to put boots on the ground in Ukraine.

Instead, the British government claimed that RT has “propagated pro-Kremlin narratives around the invasion of Ukraine, including that neo-Nazis are present in the country and that Ukrainian soldiers have committed war crimes.”The presence of neo-Nazis in Ukraine has been reported by both RT and the Western media, members of the Ukrainian military have openly stated that they intend to commit war crimes, and footage allegedly detailing such crimes is currently being investigated.General Mikhail Mizintsev, a senior Russian military planner, and Sergey Brilev, a Russian TV anchor, were also among the 14 names and entities sanctioned on Thursday.Truss’ latest sanctions came several weeks after British media regulator Ofcom revoked the broadcasting licenses of Russian media outlets, claiming they weren't in a position to cover the Ukraine crisis. Meanwhile, London's own state-controlled BBC has covered all conflicts involving the UK in living memory, including the “weapons of mass destruction” pretense for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which turned out to be false.While UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has condemned Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine, his office has not supported all of the west’s retaliatory measures. In a briefing on Tuesday, Dujarric said that Guterres does not support proposals by US lawmakers to exclude Russia from the UN Human Rights Council, and that such a move would set “a dangerous precedent.”"

In a short post on his Facebook page on Monday, Gennadiy Druzenko said he and his fellow frontline medics do not castrate anyone and have no plans to do so.“Those were the emotions. I’m sorry. We are saving lives. Period,” the post said.The doctor added a screenshot to the post, which appeared to be a threat addressed to him. It cited what was presumably his personal data, including phone numbers and an address, and a promise to “come unannounced” and “cut off [his] balls.”Druzenko, a well-known volunteer medic, had been talking to many Western media outlets about his unit’s work in Ukraine amid the Russian attack on his country, and had made his incendiary claims about Russian POWs in an interview with Ukrainian TV on Sunday.“I gave my doctors … a very strict order to castrate all men, because they are cockroaches and not people,” he had claimed.The credibility of the threat against Druzenko remains unclear. During the interview, he claimed his home in Kiev was unlivable due to the conflict, and that he was mostly spending his time at bases of the unit he commands.The swift U-turn echoes that of a Ukrainian TV host who, addressing the Russian people, declared on air that he was adopting the “doctrine” of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann and would “do everything in my power to ensure that you and your children never live on this earth.” The reasoning cited by Fahruddin Sharafmal, who is of Middle Eastern origin, was that by mass-murdering a nation’s children, one could eliminate the nation itself.After a public outcry, Sharafmal apologized for having advocated genocide, and said he was sorry if his rant had damaged the reputation of Ukrainian troops. His words had spilled out “due to emotions” stemming from having lost a friend to the conflict, he said. He stated that Ukrainians would “never be inhuman, unlike the Russians.”Both Sharafmal and Druzenko are being investigated in Russia for possible crimes related to their respective remarks."

The deal is aimed at decreasing Europe’s dependence on Russian energy supplies by partly replacing them with American fossil fuels.However, environmentalists take issue with the idea of swapping one source of fossil fuels for another instead of “transitioning to affordable clean energy.”“Allowing for the expansion of new and expanded gas export facilities would lock in decades of reliance on risky, volatile fossil fuels and spell disaster for our climate and already overburdened Gulf coast communities,” Kelly Sheehan, senior director of energy campaigns at the Sierra Club, an American environmental organization, said in a statement on Friday.Sheehan concluded that it was only by “reducing reliance on fossil fuels” that countries could “stop being vulnerable to the whims of greedy industries and geopolitics.”Echoing the above warnings, Kassie Siegel, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, equated “pushing new toxic export facilities and decades more methane gas” with a “death sentence for those on the frontlines of the climate emergency.” She added that more American LNG “won’t solve Europe’s current crisis” anyway.“Approving more export terminals, pipelines and fossil fuel production only throws fuel on the fire of our burning world,” she said.According to the International Energy Agency, to keep global temperatures from rising 1.5C above the pre-industrial era, humanity should stop building new fossil fuel infrastructure now. Scientists believe that if the said threshold is exceeded, the planet will experience a dramatic rise in dangerous heatwaves, flooding, droughts, and wildfires that could potentially displace populations.Speaking in Brussels on Friday, President Joe Biden announced that the LNG supply deal would ensure that “families in Europe can get through this winter,” while putting a dent in Russia’s gas revenue, which, according to Biden, Moscow pumped into its “war machine.” He also claimed that the plan would not undermine his administration’s ambitious climate goals, saying that the conflict in Ukraine would serve as a “catalyst” for broader introduction of renewables.Under the deal, America will provide an additional 15 billion cubic meters of LNG to the European Union this year alone. This cited amount of gas is expected to supplant roughly a tenth of gas imported from Russia. Brussels has revealed plans to further ramp up LNG imports from the US and several other countries down the road, in a bid to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels."

With petrol and diesel prices at the pumps soaring by 50p per litre since this time last year, driven in part by Western sanctions on Russia over its operation to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine, the UK Chancellor has reportedly been mulling a 5p-per-litre cut in fuel duty in the spring mini-budget. Furthermore, Sunak had indicated earlier that his Spring Statement - one of two that the HM Treasury makes annually to Parliament upon publication of economic forecasts – would contain new measures that would show the government is prepared to “stand by” budget-squeezed families. That, according to the Chancellor, includes “security for working families as we help with the cost of living,” as well as “the security of more resilient public finances”. In interviews ahead of the Spring Statement, Sunak highlighted that he was aware high prices at the pumps are “one of the biggest bills people face”. Appearing on Sky News’ Sophy Ridge On Sunday Sunak had stated: As prices at the pumps have soared to record highs of £1.66 per litre for petrol and £1.77 for diesel, slashing fuel duty has long been demanded by Conservative backbenchers. In the UK, fuel duty is 57.95p a litre, plus 20% VAT, and has remained frozen for 12 years. Labour shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds was cited by UK media outlets as saying that the mulled 5p per litre cut would save families no more than an average of £2 per tank of fuel. According to The Resolution Foundation, even a 10p fuel duty cut would reverse only around a quarter of the past year’s rise in costs. Another option open to the UK Chancellor is to raise the threshold at which workers start paying national insurance contributions (NICs) - Britain's social security tax. If the threshold, which will stand at £9,880 from April due to the 1.25 per cent NI rise earmarked for health and social care, is brought closer to the personal allowance of £12,570 that applies to income tax, it would ensure that around 150,000 lower-income workers are exempt. Sunak could also choose to defer the increase planned for this April.  To support poorer households, the British Chancellor has also been facing calls to raise the value of universal credit by more than the 3.1% set for April, originally based on September’s inflation rate. Furthermore, to offer business support amid high energy costs, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has been urging Sunak to turn his “super deduction”, offering tax savings on business investment, into a permanent deduction to offset a rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25% planned from April 2023. The super-deduction tax break, intended to spur business investment, was a tax relief introduced for two years for expenditure from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023. A company can claim back up to 25p for every pound invested in ‘qualifying’ machinery and equipment, and was touted by Rishi Sunak as a “direct way to help businesses invest.” As Rishi Sunak presents his update on the economy based on the forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) there are expectations for a weaker economic outlook amid high inflation set to eat away at the spending power of consumers. According to the Bank of England, inflation will reach 8% this April, possibly later on peaking at 10%. Furthermore, many British households will face what financial expert Martin Lewis called a “fiscal punch in the face” when the energy price cap increases from 1 April for approximately 22 million customers. Those on default tariffs paying by direct debit will face an increase of £693 from £1,277 to £1,971 per year. Prepayment customers will see an increase of £708 from £1,309 to £2,017. Lewis had warned on Sunday  at Parliament's business and energy committee: "

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, cited by Reuters, responded to Biden's words, noting that it was not up to the US president to decide who the president of Russia is. A significant part of Biden's speech in Poland was dedicated to the situation in Ukraine, which the West claims was ""invaded"" by Russia. President Vladimir Putin ordered the launch of a special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February in response to a request from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) to defend them against Ukrainian forces shelling their cities. Putin stated that the goals of the operation are the demilitarization and de-Nazification of Ukraine. The Kremlin has repeatedly stressed that its armed forces are not targeting civilian infrastructure and aim exclusively at military targets and objects used by the Ukrainian military and nationalist battalions.

This will strengthen the international financial isolation of Russia and become an effective tool for maximum counteraction to Russian aggression in the financial sector,” the statement reads, as cited by RIA Novosti.After the start of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, the US and its allies began restricting and banning Russia’s largest banks and state-owned companies, and froze around $300 billion in Russia’s forex reserves. While the EU banned operations to manage reserves and assets of the Bank of Russia, European countries are still allowed to carry out transactions with the regulator in cases of urgent need.Earlier this month, the EU disconnected seven Russian banks from SWIFT. The list includes VTB, Rossiya, Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Sovcombank, and VEB.RF.SWIFT itself is not a payment system, but an electronic document management tool. Using it, banks can send orders to their foreign partners and correspondent banks for currency transfers, as well as confirming transactions and issuing guarantees for their clients.Disconnecting the Russian central bank from SWIFT could sever the regulator’s ability to conduct international transactions. For instance, it may affect Russia’s ability to repay its sovereign debt, operations with which have, for now, not been subject to sanctions. Cut off from SWIFT, Russia could still pay its obligations in rubles, but international credit rating agencies have said that this may constitute a default, which would make borrowing funds for Russia in the future more difficult and expensive.However, SWIFT has alternatives. In Russia, it is the SPFS (Financial Message Transfer System), which has similar functionality and allows the transmission of messages in SWIFT format. China, which has no plans to cut ties with Russia, has its own payment system, CIPS (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System), while other countries, including India, have been working on setting up payment mechanisms which would allow national currency transactions with Russia.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

Medinsky is expected to provide additional information later in the day, according to Peskov. Peskov's comments follow Medinsky's remarks at a press conference in Istanbul, Turkey on Tuesday following negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation, during which he told reporters that the two sides had brought up a proposed commitment by Kiev to reject the idea of ""returning"" Crimea and the Donbass to its jurisdiction using force.  Ukraine was said to have proposed holding 15 years of bilateral talks on Crimea and the port city of Sevastopol, and to have brought up the concept of a permanent neutral, non-bloc, non-WMD-possessor status secured by international guarantors. Russian deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin, who was present alongside Medinsky at the Istanbul talks, said that Russia would dramatically reduce its military operations in the regions of Kiev and Chernigov in a bid to ""increase mutual trust"" and create the preconditions for further negotiations. Medinsky was tapped by President Putin to head up the Russian negotiating team at talks in Ukraine which began in late February in Belarus. Russia began a military operation in Ukraine on 24 February after months of shelling, sniper and sabotage attacks by Ukrainian forces against the Donbass republics, whose status as sovereign nations Moscow recognized on 21 February. The military operation, being waged in conjunction with Russia's Donbass allies, followed months of escalating tensions between Russia and Kiev's Western patrons, and a refusal by the US and NATO to agree not to expand into Ukraine. The Ukrainian crisis began in February 2014, when US and EU-backed forces toppled the country's unpopular but democratically elected government in a coup and proceeded to try to incorporate the country into the Western economic and security blocs. The coup prompted the majority of residents in Crimea to vote in a referendum to break off from Ukraine and rejoin Russia, and sparked a bloody civil war in the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Lugansk after local residents similarly attempted to break away from Kiev's control. Pro-Russian protest movements in the eastern and southern Ukrainian regions of Kharkov, Nikolayev and Odessa were brutally suppressed, with over three dozen activists burned alive after neo-Nazi gangs set fire to the trade unions building in Odessa in May 2014, and dozens more imprisoned, tortured, murdered and disappeared elsewhere by nationalists and security forces.

The conflict has been described by the UN as the “world’s worst humanitarian crisis,” and has resulted in the deaths of 377,000 people, more than two-thirds under the age of five, per UN figures at the end of 2021. It is often seen as a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, due to Iran’s backing of the Houthis. Tehran denies arming the rebels, however.Attacks like those on Sunday represent “a direct threat to the security of oil supplies in these extremely sensitive circumstances witnessed by the global energy markets,” the Saudi statement continued. Global energy markets have already responded with shock and volatility to the conflict in Ukraine, with US gas prices reaching a historic record of $4.33 per gallon earlier this month, and settling to $4.25 on Monday, according to the American Automobile Association. Brent Crude Oil is currently trading at around $112 a barrel, down from a nearly $140 earlier this month but still around $15 higher than before the outbreak of hostilities.Decisions by the US and UK to ban Russian energy imports have also put tremendous pressure on the market, compounded by the Biden administration’s reluctance to grant drilling permits in the US and refusal to allow the completion of the Keystone XL pipeline.Against this background, the US has urged the Saudi Arabian-led OPEC bloc to pump more oil, something that OPEC has thus far refused to do. The US, however, has recently stepped up supplies of missile interceptor batteries to Saudi Arabia to safeguard its facilities from future attacks, officials told AP."

However, she stated that the US dollar, traditionally considered the world reserve currency, is not likely to suffer an “imminent demise.”Still, depending on how long the crisis in Ukraine lasts, there could be larger effects, Gopinath said.Touching on the prospect of Russia’s sovereign debt default, the senior IMF official said its potential impact on the global economy would be limited and would not pose a “systemic risk,” because the “numbers that we’re looking at are relatively small from a global perspective.” On the other hand, for Russia, a default would have long-term consequences, Gopinath added.“When you’ve defaulted, reentry into the market is not easy. And that can take a long time.”The sanctions placed on Russia over the past month have effectively cut the country’s ties to the Western financial system, banning most transactions except for debt repayment operations and oil purchases, at least for now.The measures also froze around $300 billion that Russia holds in foreign currency reserves abroad. International credit rating agencies earlier this month lowered Russia’s rating to pre-default, predicting that Moscow will not be able to fulfill its obligations to foreign creditors. Russia has so far averted default, making a $117 million interest payment on two dollar-denominated bonds last week. Media reports also said that Russia made another $66 million debt payment in US dollars on Tuesday.Moscow has repeatedly stated that it is fully capable of repaying its debts, and could even make the transfers in the national currency, the ruble, if other options are exhausted.However, according to Moody’s Investors Services, there is still the danger of missed payment, as the exemption from sanctions on Russia’s debt operations expires on May 25, while Moscow still has payments worth $100 million due on May 27. Moody’s said that after that date, Russia’s creditors “will require a specific license to continue to receive debt repayments, which will further impair investors’ ability” to receive their funds.Russia has accused the US and its allies of trying to engineer an artificial default, since the country has the money to pay its debts. Moscow says it is the Western financial institutions that are in default, because by freezing the country’s assets, they are failing with regard to their obligations.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

The move comes as the largest release of its kind in US history. ","Preliminary data shows that US stocks closed up the first quarter on Thursday with its largest quarterly decline in two years.  As the conflict in Ukraine persists and the Federal Reserve responds to inflation, the S&amp;P 500 observed a loss of 1.57%, to 4,530.41, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.54% to 14,220.52 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 535.80 points (1.52%) to 34,693.01.  Losses deepened during the final hour of trading on Thursday, which marked the last day of trading for March, as well as the first quarter.  Brent crude, a waterborne crude oil used as the international benchmark for much of the world's oil, settled down $5.54 (4.9%), at $107.91 per barrel, following a session low of $104.20 per barrel. Brent was up nearly 7% for March, and rose some 39% for the first quarter.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the US oil benchmark, settled down $7.54 (7%), at $100.28. WTI was up nearly 5% for March, and rose some 33% for the first quarter.  Thursday's market close came hours after the White House announced it would releasing an unprecedented total of 180 million barrels from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve over the next six months.  Overall, both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average respectively closed down 5.2% and 4.8%, and the Nasdaq shed around 10% in the first quarter.  Market data showed that although consumer prices rose a bit in February amid intensified pricing pressures, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose by 0.4% (excluding food and energy data).  The PCE number falls in line with the expectations of the Federal Reserve. Ken Polcari, a managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors, told Yahoo Finance that although the number was on target for the Fed, the US central bank will likely become more aggressive in raising interest rates to address inflation.    ""The PCE number came out today, which is the Fed’s preferred number, and although that was right on target, it was higher than it was last month, and the sense is it is going to continue to go higher, therefore you are seeing some weakness,"" Polcari told the outlet.

No matter how sad it may sound, the sport cannot move without worthy competitors,"" the 25-year-old Rylov said on social media announcing his personal boycott. The Russian Swimming Federation stated that ""the FINA press release is incorrect"" and apparently received a letter from FINA with the correct wording which means that Russian athletes might be able to appear in other competitions under neutral status. ""The possibility of participating in other events is theoretically preserved, but FINA will now consider each specific case for the participation of Russians,"" Vladimir Salnikov explained to Match TV."

While such a move is a historic first for the bloc, it is substantially more modest than the EU army proposed by France’s Emmanuel Macron.The “European Union just approved Strategic Compass,” Latvian FM Edgars Rinkēvičs announced, following a meeting of European defense and foreign ministers in Brussels earlier in the day. The plan provides a “necessary toolbox for the EU to become a real geopolitical defense and security player together with NATO,” he said, and is only the “beginning of the journey” for the bloc’s military future. The plan itself has been around since 2020, when it was proposed by the European Council. Since then it has been criticized by those Eastern European countries that prefer to rely on NATO and its US muscle for their defense needs, and by commentators in neutral Ireland, who sought assurances that only peacekeeping missions be undertaken by the bloc, and that the UN be given a central role in decision-making.However, the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine has hastened the plan’s adoption. In its current form, Strategic Compass is aimed at improving cooperation between existing European militaries, boosting cooperation with NATO, consolidating cyber-defense capabilities, and facilitating joint investment in research and development. However, it also facilitates the creation of a 5,000-strong “rapid deployment capacity” of EU troops, marking the first step taken by the bloc toward creating a common military. This step toward militarization is significant, especially as it comes less than a month after the European Commission announced it would supply Ukraine with €450 million ($497 million) worth of arms and ammunition.A strategic assessment by the EU identified “regional instability, conflict, state fragility, inter-state tensions, external influences, [and the] destabilising impact of non-state actors” as reasons for drafting the plan, suggesting that the bloc may, at some point and in some capacity, intervene in future conflicts akin to the one in Ukraine. Doing so would be an unprecedented step for the union, but Strategic Compass still falls short of the united military some leaders support. Macron has long been a proponent of creating an EU army and lessening the bloc’s dependence on NATO, an alliance he called “brain dead” back in 2019.Macron renewed his push for an EU fighting force independent of NATO earlier this month, stating that the conflict in Ukraine had “changed the era” for the European Union. However, the Eastern Europeans are still content to rely on NATO for their defense needs, with Polish Deputy Prime Minister Piotr Glinski telling The Telegraph on Saturday that the EU was not ready for conflict, and that Macron’s comments risk “destabilizing Europe.”"

","The 'outburst' of the Ukraine crisis has stemmed from long-lasting differences that have existed between different countries concerning the security system in Europe, the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a press conference after the talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in China on Wednesday.  The Chinese minister added that Beijing welcomes the first results that were achieved during the Russian-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul on Tuesday and supports the continuation of the negotiations aimed at de-escalating tensions in Ukraine.  ""We support the efforts being made by Russia and all other sides to avert a full-scale humanitarian crisis,"" the Chinese top diplomat said, as quoted by the ministry. According to Wang Yi, it is necessary to build an effective and sustainable security system in Europe. The Russian top diplomat is currently on a two-day visit to China to take part in the third ministerial conference of Afghanistan's neighbouring countries and the expanded troika on Afghanistan (Russia, China, Pakistan and the US). The geopolitical situation has changed dramatically since the beginning of Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February. As Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly explained, Moscow had to begin the operation after all diplomatic means to settle the conflict between Kiev and the Russian-speaking Donbass region were exhausted. Putin said that the operation was aimed at protecting civilians in Ukraine's breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk (which were recognized by Russia as sovereign nations on 21 February) and also to demilitarise and de-Nazify the entire Ukrainian territory since numerous radical neo-Nazi armed groups had been operating there and presented a serious threat to Russian-speaking population. The operation also followed months of ineffective negotiations between Moscow and the West about NATO's eastward expansion (including prospects for Ukraine's membership in the bloc) which Russia has always categorically rejected as a threat to its national security.

At least four rounds of talks have been held so far between Moscow and Kiev to halt the ongoing operation in Ukraine.,"Sputnik spoke with Vijainder Kumar Thakur, former squadron leader of the Indian Air Force and an independent defence analyst, on the Ukrainian crisis and the impact on geopolitics of this Russia-NATO row. Sputnik: It's been one month since Moscow began a special military operation in Ukraine. How do you assess Moscow's operation so far? Vijainder K Thakur: The Russian special military operation in Ukraine has gone well so far, albeit their progress appears to have slowed down. Russian forces have wrested a very significant amount of Ukrainian territory and practically removed any future threat to the Donbass area and Crimea from a surprise attack by the Ukrainian Army. Demilitarisation and de-Nazification are ongoing but slow because at the start of the war, instead of fighting Russian forces on the borders or the hinterland, Ukrainian nationalists quickly retreated to heavily populated areas. Russia has carefully calibrated its campaign to minimise civilian casualties. Russian forces are striking at nationalists entrenched in cities in close proximity to populated areas with precision-guided artillery shells and missiles. However, footage of urban structures destroyed by Russian precision strikes, occasional collateral damage and civilian casualties are being used by the nationalists and their supporters in the West to discredit Russia's forces. Ukrainian and western Information warfare directed at Russia is high-pitched. Russian forces are holding up well in the face of disinformation. There has been no breakdown in discipline. Popular support for President Vladimir Putin within Russia remains intact. China and India have not been swayed. Sputnik: Some commentators claim that Russia is losing the operation as they observed that Russia's offensive was ""largely stalled on all fronts"" in the past few days. As you monitor the operation closely, do you find a gap in the West's assessment and facts on the ground in Ukraine? Vijainder K Thakur: I don't believe the Russian operation has stalled. Far from it! Russian forces may not have made dramatic advances in the past two weeks or so, but they have tightened their grip on important cities such as Kiev, Kharkov and Mariupol. Elite Ukrainian forces in the Donbass region and further south near Crimea have been cut off from their command and resupply centres. Ukrainian forces are surrounded and their fuel and ammunition are being rapidly depleted because of Russian precision strikes on supply depots. Casualties are mounting. Sputnik: Russia and Ukraine have held several rounds of negotiations since 24 February. Now, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants to sit with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate. Do you think talks at the top at this point will bear fruit? Vijainder K Thakur: A peace agreement would have to be based on the groundwork laid by sustained and serious negotiations by officials at different levels over many days. Top leaders, overseeing the ongoing military operation, simply don't have the time to engage in sustained peace negotiations lasting days. President Zelensky can better serve his country by providing compassionate leadership through pragmatic directions to his negotiating team, rather than negotiating directly with President Putin. Sputnik: The US has delivered security assistance worth more than $1 billion in the past week alone. However, the US and NATO declined to get involved directly and remain opposed to instituting a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Many observers have predicted that the US actions in Ukraine will trigger insurgency in the country. Do you agree with this prediction? Vijainder K Thakur: First, I don't believe it's in the long-term interest of Europe or NATO to stoke an insurgency in Ukraine. They would be shooting themselves in the foot with a rather high-calibre weapon! Failure to strike a peace agreement would lead to a wider civil war than the one that has been ongoing in Donbass since 2014.  The tragedy is that the EU and NATO have so far ignored the already ongoing civil war! Sputnik: Do you foresee the war-like situation spilling over into other regions such as the South China Sea or countries such as Poland? Vijainder K Thakur: In recent history, China has not engaged in a shooting war. It has focused almost exclusively on development, leveraging its military power, when necessary, without starting a shooting war! The US and NATO have engaged in wars where a low-cost victory was assured. Having said that, I don't think the West is done pushing buttons to provoke Russia, so an accidental escalation cannot be ruled out. However, self-preservation is a strong instinct, perhaps a stronger instinct in the more affluent West than the less affluent East. Sputnik: Several European countries have started increasing their military budget. Do you think this is the beginning of efforts to decrease dependency on the US for security? Vijainder K Thakur: Absolutely! Germany's and Japan's decision to increase their military spending is not directed at Russia. It is an acknowledgment of emerging multi-polarity in the world. Russian special operations in Ukraine indicated the end of Pax Americana. Germany and Japan will now strive for their own place in the emerging multi-polar world. "

I actually have plans to speak to Oleksandr Usyk to give him advice if he decides to make the fight, to have some special messages that he can put out there.”The 50-year-old has been in office since 2014 and has strongly criticized Russia's attack since it began on February 24.While one of Klitschko's successors as a Ukrainian champion, Vasiliy Lomachenko, has scrapped a title fight in order to join his country's military, Usyk is readying himself to fight Londoner Joshua again.“I decided to start preparing for a rematch with Anthony Joshua,"" the unbeaten former cruiserweight told his fans via social media on Friday. ""A large number of my friends support me... thank God for everything.”The younger Klitschko, who was knocked out by Joshua in a titanic clash at London's Wembley Stadium in 2017, said there were ""pros and cons"" to Usyk's ""hard"" decision.""But to have the Ukrainian flag raised and our anthem played and one of our ambassadors of our country out there in the world, with the right mindset, could be more positive than negative,"" he added.Ukraine has temporarily banned all men aged between 18 and 60 from leaving the country under martial law imposed since the conflict started.Exemptions have been arranged for elite athletes, although many of Ukraine's most successful athletes have joined the military, including members of the country's national football team.Usyk's attempt to retain his titles could take place in June, Joshua's promoter, Eddie Hearn, has predicted."

The announcement comes in the wake of reports that the United States and its Western allies have engaged in consultations on Russia’s future membership in the forum over the crisis in Ukraine.,"Group of Twenty members do not have the authority to evict Russia from the organisation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin has said. The spokesman called on the G20 to practice “true multilateralism, strengthen solidarity and cooperation and work in joint hands to respond to mounting challenges,” including economic matters, sustainable development, ecology and health. On Tuesday, when asked to comment on a Reuters report that the US and its Western allies had engaged in consultations about Russia’s future in the G20, Biden national security advisor Jake Sullivan said that “it cannot be business as usual for Russia in international institutions and in the international community.” Sources said to be involved in discussions told Reuters that the US and its allies were aware that China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Saudi Arabia or others would likely veto any Western push to expel Russia from the body. With this in mind, the sources said the US and its allies could just skip meetings. An official from an Asian G20 member said it would be “impossible to remove Russia” from the group unless it decides to leave itself. “There’s simply no procedure to deprive Russia of G20 membership,” the official said. Earlier, Polish officials suggested Poland should take Russia’s place in the G20, and that this proposal had received a “positive response” from the US Department of Commerce. On Wednesday, Russian Ambassador to Indonesia Lyudmila Vorobieva confirmed that President Putin intends to attend the upcoming G20 summit in Bali in October. “Not only G20, many organizations now in the West are trying to expel Russia. The World Trade Organization, the World Customs Organization. What they’re trying to do is actually to destroy the whole trade and logistics system that has been so painstakingly built in the last decades. The question is why. So the reaction of the West is absolutely disproportional. G20 is not a forum to discuss or to solve these kinds of crises. Actually it’s a forum aimed at improving economic situation and solving mostly economic problems,” Vorobieva said. The G20 grouping consists of 20 members – including 19 countries plus the European Union, with the group accounting for 80 percent of world trade, two thirds of the planet’s population, and nearly 90 percent of gross world product. Founded in 1999, the organization is envisioned as a major platform encouraging coordination and cooperation in areas ranging from climate change and sustainable development to global financial stability and debt to Covid.

US President Joe Biden admitted at the NATO summit in Poland this week that the embargo on Russia would lead to food shortages.","The UK's foreign secretary has hinted that the West will keep sanctions on Russia even after the end of the conflict in Ukraine. Liz Truss told The Sunday Telegraph that the measures, which include a ban on energy imports by the UK, US, and Canada, will only be lifted after a ""full ceasefire and withdrawal"" by Russian forces. She said Russia would have to pledge no further ""aggression"" against Ukraine, and would be hit with ""snapback sanctions"" if it did. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has demanded that Russia not only end the ""demilitarisation and de-Nazification"" operation it launched on 24 February, but also withdraw from the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk Peoples' Republics, which Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised on 22 February, eight years after they declared independence. Zelensky also wants Russia to cede Crimea, whose residents voted overwhelmingly to reunite with Russia in 2014 following the violent Maidan Square coup in Kiev. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said this week that the West was waging a hybrid economic ""total war"" against Russia through its sanctions regime. Truss also claimed that Russia had failed to honour previous agreements on Ukraine, a possible reference to the two Minsk accords brokered between Kiev and the Donbass republics by Russia, France, and Germany. Russia has no obligations under those accords, but Ukraine has continuously broken its pledges to pull back heavy artillery from the ""line of control"" and cease bombarding civilian areas. Kiev reportedly deployed some 150,000 troops along the border with Russia and the Donbass republics, and stepped up its artillery attacks before Russia launched its military operation. Documents captured by Russian forces detail plans for a huge Ukrainian offensive on the two breakaway states. Sanctions have already hit the West at least as hard as Russia, with prices of natural gas and oil soaring — with a knock-on effect on household bills and service station prices. US President Joe Biden admitted at the NATO summit in Poland this week that the embargo on Russia, which supplies one-quarter of the world's wheat exports, would lead to food shortages. Meanwhile, Russia is diversifying its energy export markets to China and India, while Putin announced that European Union states must henceforth pay for Russian gas in roubles, not euros or US dollars. The Russian Ministry of Defence announced on Friday that it had destroyed two-thirds of the Ukrainian Army's 2,400 armoured vehicles, two-thirds of its air force, almost all its anti-aircraft systems, and sunk or captured the entire Ukrainian Navy after a month of operations, for the loss of 1,351 soldiers killed and some 3,800 injured.

","Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has denounced the West's accusations against Russia in connection with its ongoing operation to ""demilitarize and de-Nazify"" Ukraine as shameful and “stupid”, reminding that 19 NATO countries unlawfully bombed Serbia in 1999. Speaking on the tragic anniversary of the start of the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, on 24 March 1999, he continued: According to Serbia’s president, small nations are ""always victims."" “When you talk about the big countries, then their morals, principles and values, which they constantly talk about, do not exist at all. If they existed, the question would arise - why not bomb those who are bigger, who did you much more damage than small ones like us… but they don't want to, because the bigger nations can retaliate,"" the Serbian leader said. Washington, its European and NATO allies have been targeting Russia with sanctions over its special operation to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine after the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed amid increasing attacks from Kiev forces. Moscow has underscored that the goal of its operation is to exclusively target military infrastructure, with the Kremlin having no plans to occupy Ukraine. Earlier, in an address to citizens on 2 March, President Vucic said that the Serbian authorities supported four of the 13 points of the UN resolution condemning Russia's actions in Ukraine - those that do not imply sanctions. He added that Serbia did not plan to alienate the property of Russian companies in the country, but noted that the crisis due to hostilities in Ukraine is having a dramatic impact on Serbia, which has come under enormous foreign policy pressure. ""We insist on respecting the territorial integrity of states, this is our principle. On this we base the preservation of Kosovo and Metohija as part of Serbia. If we had not condemned the invasion of Ukraine, we would never again have the moral right to present this argument,"" Vucic said on the B92 TV channel. In 1999, an armed confrontation between Albanian separatists from the Kosovo Liberation Army and the army and police of Serbia led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), at that time consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, by NATO forces. Carried out without the approval of the UN Security Council, the military operation was based on the assertion of Western countries that the authorities of the FRY carried out ethnic cleansing in the Kosovo autonomy and provoked a humanitarian catastrophe there. Air strikes by the North Atlantic Alliance lasted from March 24 to June 10, 1999 and led to the death of more than 2.5 thousand people, including 87 children, and damage of 100 billion dollars.

New Zealand is playing its part,” Ardern said.Russia sent its troops into Ukraine over a month ago, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."

The agency has also removed two companies from the list.The new companies have been added for allegedly falling under the umbrella of the Russian Federation’s aerospace, electronics, and maritime sectors.Individuals involved in those sectors have been subject to sanctions since last April, and the latest round allows for sanctions to be placed on any individual or entity “determined to operate or have operated in any of those sectors.”“Today’s sanctions are a part of the Administration’s comprehensive response to Russia’s to restrict their access to resources, sectors of their economy that are essential to supplying and financing the continued invasion of Ukraine,” according to the Treasury’s press release.Most of the sanctioned individuals are Russian citizens linked to the companies that are being added to the list. One of the designated entities is the Vector Scientific Research Institute, which produces software and communications technology equipment, having been founded over a century ago as Russia’s oldest radio engineering operation. The new restrictions also target the Molecular Electronics Research Institute, which is part of Russia’s largest scientific and technological research conglomerate, focused on micro- and nano-electronics as well as the development and manufacture of semiconductors. Serniya is a major engineering and equipment manufacturer that specializes in research and development across Russia’s high-tech industries. Photon Pro is an aerospace and engineering company focused on developing telemetry and digital control systems, telecoms, data transfer, and other electronics research and development areas. The fresh sanctions list also includes Joint Stock Company Mikron, Russia’s largest chipmaker and biggest manufacturer and exporter of microelectronics. Two subsidiaries of Ozon Bank were successfully able to have themselves removed from the Specially Designated Nationals list after making the argument that its inclusion as an entity related to the sanctioned entity Sovcombank Open Joint Stock Company was no longer relevant, given that Ozon had bought out its share of the company. Ozon is a major e-commerce platform offering a wide range of categories of retail goods for sale and delivery, similar to Amazon.com. It also trades in the US under the symbol OZON.While the Biden administration has sought to cut Russia off from the high-tech industry, particularly with regard to its military, some politicians, including former US Assistant Secretary of State Robert Charles, American economist James Rickards, and Deputy Chairman of Russia’s National Security Council Dmitry Medvedev have warned that the sanctions will effectively have a “boomerang effect,” and indeed the ruble has regained a sizable portion of the value it initially lost in the wake of the US’ and Europe’s first rounds of sanctions that followed the launch of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. The value of the Russian currency has recovered in recent days, as President Vladimir Putin has called on Europe and other “unfriendly” oil and gas customers to pay for their fuel in rubles."

Earlier in March, the Russian Agency for Air Transport advised Russian airlines with aircraft in foreign registries to suspend flights abroad and from abroad to avoid their detention amid Russia's special military operation in Ukraine. On 24 February, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian forces. In response to the operation, a number of Western countries have imposed sanctions against Russia, with many of them closing their airspace to all Russian flights. "

""If the countries refuse to pay, Putin should immediately turn off the energy. Indeed, he should have done so before launching his military operation in Donbass. It is nonsensical for Russia to keep alive the economies of countries that are sending weapons to Ukrainian Nazis to kill Russians"". Russian President Vladimir Putin on 23 March ordered the Russian Central Bank and the government to work out the means for ruble payments for Russian natural gas exports by nations designated as ""unfriendly"" by Moscow. The list of foreign states that committed ""unfriendly actions"", including sanctions and seizure of assets, against the Russian Federation, Russian legal entities, and individuals was made by the government earlier this month. The Russian president explained that after Western countries had ""frozen"" Russian dollar and euro assets, it became clear that ""supplying our goods to the European Union and the United States and receiving payment in dollars, euros, and a number of other currencies does not make any sense to us"". Putin's order came like a bolt from the blue, triggering confusion, rejection, and irritation among the states that slapped tough sanctions on Russia over its special operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Japan said that it is ""unsure"" how Russia will handle the required ruble payments for its energy. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz claimed last Friday that the contracts ""clearly stipulated"" that Russia's hydrocarbons should be paid in euros. For his part, French President Emmanuel Macron told journalists on Saturday that the Russian move ""is not in line with what was signed, and I do not see why we would apply it"". On 28 March, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that during the coming four days, the Russian energy corporation Gazprom is expected to develop a ""transparent and understandable system"" in both technical and logistical terms. Once the system is established, Gazprom will inform its customers about the new rules, said Peskov, adding that Russia won't provide energy for free to those ""unfriendly countries"" which refuse to pay in rubles. The same day German Energy Minister Robert Habeck said that G7 nations ""reject"" Russia's demand regarding ruble payments for energy resources and claimed the G7 is ready for ""all scenarios"" including Moscow suspending gas supplies. Dr Roberts hailed the Kremlin's decision to switch to ruble payments, asking in his blog: ""Is Russia going for the petro-ruble?"" According to the economist, Moscow could apparently be pursuing two goals: first, forcing Russia's energy customers to bypass the sanctions; second, ruble payments support the value of the ruble and frustrate the sanctioning countries' hope of causing its value to collapse. However, ""payment in rubles should be the policy regardless of sanctions"", according to Dr Roberts. During President Joe Biden's visit to Europe last week European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledged to dramatically ""reduce dependence"" on Russia's energy supplies. The bloc's flagship, Germany, also vowed to become ""more energy independent"" from Russia's oil, coal, and gas on 27 March.  Nevertheless, earlier last week Chancellor Scholz admitted that an immediate ban on Russian energy imports would prompt an economic recession both in Germany and across Europe. ""The truth is that the sanctions that have already been decided also hit many citizens hard, and not just at the gas pump"", Scholz told the Bundestag on 23 March, adding that sanctions ""must not hit the European countries harder than the Russian leadership"".

Western media claimed the US was negotiating a possible transfer of the weapons from Turkey to Ukraine, while offering various defense concessions in return.“This is a done deal for us. They are our property serving our defense, so it’s over,” the Turkish leader said, when asked about the S-400 systems.Donald Trump's US government kicked Ankara out of the F-35 program in retaliation for buying Russian military hardware, back in 2019.Erdogan said his country’s reaction to the transfer idea was well-summarized in a letter from his spokesman, Fahrettin Altun, published by the Wall Street Journal this week. The official said the current US administration should reverse Trump's move without any preconditions, in order to repair relations.Erodgan claimed NATO has been revitalizated by the Ukraine crisis, remarking that French President Macron, who infamously called the military bloc “brain dead” in 2019, has been proven wrong. Leaders of member states gathered behind closed doors in Brussels on Thursday to discuss their response to the Russian attack on Ukraine. Turkey reasserted its role as an essential part of the insitution, Erdogan stated.Unlike other members, Turkey has refused to impose economic sanctions against Russia and has kept diplomatic channels open with both Moscow and Kiev. Erdogan said his country had no intention of hurting itself by breaking economic ties with Russia, its most important energy supplier.“I cannot leave my people in the snow in the winter,” the president said, referring to natural gas supplies from Russia. “I cannot completely stop our industry.”He expects the pragmatic approach to benefit Turkish tourism, saying he anticipates Russian visitors to be a major source of revenue for the industry in 2022. The financial blockade that the West has imposed on Russia has proven that Ankara was right to suggest switching payments between Turkey and Russia to their national currencies, Erdogan added.Commenting on Turkey’s mediation efforts between Moscow and Kiev, Erdogan announced that he would be talking to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky later on Friday and Russian President Vladimir Putin over the weekend or early next week.He said the two sides had found common ground on four out of six principal points of contention during their peace talks.Kiev is unwilling to relinquish official sovereignty over Crimea and the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, Erdogan explained. Zelensky previously suggested he could put the territorial issues to a referendum, with Moscow replying that the proposal was not feasible under the circumstances.Crimea was reabsorbed Russia in 2014, following the events of the Kiev Maidan, while the two other regions were recognized by Moscow as sovereign republics days before it launched its attack on Ukraine in late February. Protecting Donetsk and Lugansk from Kiev’s forces has been one of the official goals of the Russian offensive.Erdogan said the hostilities in Ukraine are a major crisis for the world, both due to the humanitarian damage they were causing and because of the economic impact of the anti-Russian embargoes and Moscow’s counter sanctions.Turkey was affected indirectly by the potential threat of Ukrainian mines in the Black Sea, which Russia warned may untether and float towards shipping routes through the Turkish Straits. Ankara's navy is working diligently to deal with it, Erdogan outlined.His government is eager to see a swift peaceful resolution to the situation, he stressed, and is doing its part to make it happen."

Previously, at the height of the 2020 presidential campaign, the paper had dismissed the laptop story as ""Russian disinformation."" ","Citing the need for “full truth” and “complete accountability”, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., has written letters to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, Chief of staff Ronald Klain, *Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, as well as multiple former US intelligence officials, and others, demanding that they preserve all Hunter Biden-related records. Issa has been calling out the mainstream media and social media over a “conspiracy of monumental size” regarding the censoring of the Hunter Biden laptop story in the run-up to the 2020 Presidential Elections. These materials, according to the republican politician, would be instrumental in driving a thorough GOP probe into how Big Tech and media colluded to suppress the Hunter Biden scandals if they win back a majority in the November midterm elections. Underscoring that material preservation was critical for Congress to be able to carry out a fact-finding inquiry into actions by technology companies, media and political allies “to suppress information and prevent public awareness of matters involving the Biden Family,"" Darrell Issa added in a statement to Fox News: Darrell Issa was one of many Republicans who were outraged after The New York Times confirmed last week the authenticity of Hunter Biden's infamous laptop after dismissing the original article in the New York Post (NYP) almost a year and a half ago as ""Russian disinformation"". In 2020, the NYP alleged that the Mac belonging to Hunter Biden that he left at a repair shop in Delaware in 2019 contained several emails questioning claims by Joe Biden that he never used his former position as vice president to aid his son in the latter's foreign business dealings. At the time, then-US President Donald Trump dubbed the device ""the laptop from hell"". Back then, NYT claimed the New York Post story on the laptop was unsubstantiated, and social media companies had moved quickly to suspended The Post’s accounts and blocked users from sharing the story, citing policies that prohibit distribution of hacked material. However, in its 16 March report about the ongoing federal probe into Hunter Biden's unpaid tax bills, the NYT said that when looking into the younger Biden's business dealings certain emails had been scrutinised by prosecutors. According to The New York Times, the emails in question were obtained by them from ""a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr Biden in a Delaware repair shop"". Furthermore, ""the email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation"". After this admission by NYT, Issa slammed the censorship related to the Hunter Biden story as amounting to a Watergate-level scandal. He tweeted on 17 March that he was calling for a Congressional investigation into how “big tech, mainstream media, and the Democrat industrial complex colluded to suppress the Hunter Biden scandals — and during the last days of the 2020 election.” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) also went on Twitter to say that Donald Trump, the republicans had been right. Last week Darrell Issa remarked that while he realised that Joe Biden would be “finishing out his term as corrupt as we now know he is”, the “big crime” was that the New York Post had come out with “credible evidence”, but was shut down by the “New York Times”, “public broadcasting”, and “by having more than fifty of the most informed people in the intelligence world, all saying that they knew that this was false information.” *Facebook is an extremist organisation banned in Russia.

This was done “in order to prevent a threat to the life and health” of these people so that they could safely return to their home countries, the minister explained.Last week, the Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki urged to stop issuing visas for Russian citizens as part of new sanctions against Russia.“Another suggestion is to freeze visas for all Russians,” he said, explaining that, in his opinion, this was necessary to make Russians aware of what was happening in Ukraine. Belgium previously voiced a similar proposal.Japan earlier froze the issuance of visas to certain categories of Russians, while Lithuania, Latvia, Norway, and the Czech Republic have stopped issuing visas to all of the country's citizens. Prague and Oslo have also suspended the acceptance of documents for a residence permit.The Russian list of “unfriendly states,” which initially featured just two countries – the US and Czech Republic – was significantly expanded in March in the wake of the unprecedented sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West. Now it includes all the EU members, Ukraine, the UK, Canada, Japan, and others.All these countries are subject to various retaliation measures, restrictions and specific requirements from Russia. Recently, President Vladimir Putin ordered all payments for the natural gas from the “unfriendly states” to be switched to rubles – a measure which was collectively rejected on Monday by the G7. Another “retaliation” initiative saw the Finance Ministry requesting Russian companies wishing to work with firms from countries on the list to receive government permission first.Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two Donbass republics by force."

They called on the US and the West to play a positive role in promoting peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, instead of transferring weapons to fan the flames. In a nine-minute interview with Margaret Brennan on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Monday, Qin was interrupted by Brennan more than 20 times with the latter continuing to ask whether China will support Russia over Ukraine, and why has China not condemned Russia. Despite Brennan's constant interruptions, Qin repeated that ""China has good relations with Russia, has good relations with Ukraine. And China keeps close communications with the US and with Europe. These enable China to reach out to all parties concerned in the crisis. So China's unique role can help with the peaceful settlement of the crisis.""  Some criticized the CBS host for being ""rude"" to interrupt Qin from fully uttering his opinions. Analysts noted that such a scenario shows how eager the US is to pressure China into condemning Russia, but China has not and will not jump into the trap. Unlike China, which has made efforts to promote peace talks, the US - the initiator of the crisis - has done nothing positive to promote a ceasefire but fans the flames.It is true that the US is the obstacle of Russia-Ukraine negotiations. As the conflict continues and talks remain inconclusive, the situation will actually benefit the US, for it would be able to suppress Russia on one hand and strengthen its control over Europe on the other, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Monday.The interests of the US on the military conflict is different from that of Ukraine, although it seems that the US has been backing Ukraine by sending weapons, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times. ""In other words, preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is not the strategic aim of the US."" Biden's plan for Europe is obvious, that he will urge Europe to unify its stance and align with the US on Russia, Cui Heng said, ""because now we see a division in the EU's stances on Russia, especially on the issue of oil and gas. Countries like Hungary, Poland, Germany and France that still have a need for Russia's oil and gas maintain a reserved attitude toward Russia, while the US and Canada already banned imports of Russian energy.""Observers believe that having reached a point like this, the US' fanning flames will only do harm to the peaceful settlement between Russia and Ukraine. Instead, there should be a mediator, pushing forward relevant sides to approach each other's terms, and that role can only be played by China. ""For one thing, China has maintained good relations with both countries, and for another thing, China's independent foreign policy in the conflicts without siding with any party has allowed China to have a unique position,"" Cui Heng said. *This article was originally published by The Global Times.

6a287a5a-f629-41fc-80a3-aa4b691ac3ec,https://www.rt.com/news/552305-russophobia-ukraine-offensive-moscow/,Russophobia didn’t start with Ukraine. It’s long been brewing in the West,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.03/xxs/6235ff5385f54044a8466031.jpg,It simply reached the level of hysteria after Moscow launched its offensive against Kiev,"Moscow’s actions in Ukraine have exposed a deep-seated latent racism toward the Russian people that a number of Western institutions – not least Hollywood and the legacy mainstream media – have been cultivating for far too long.Of all the major military operations that have been undertaken since the start of the millennium – in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen, to name but some of the broken places – Russia’s “special operation” in Ukraine already stands apart for a very peculiar reason, and that is the ugly backlash it has generated against ordinary Russian citizens.By now, many people will have heard the stories circulating online of Russians enduring discrimination in Western capitals – from famed conductor Valery Gergiev losing his job at the Munich Philharmonic, to children being bullied in school, to families being denied service in cafés and restaurants. Not even medical facilities are immune from the lunacy. Last week, the Iatros Clinic in Munich, Germany, announced it would no longer treat Russians and Belarusians, and I’m guessing that unspeakable act of cruelty would have included pediatric patients too. Only after experiencing a wave of online criticism, proving that not everyone has lost their mind, did the facility retract its racist decision.Equally astonishing has been the West’s brutal sanctions regime, which is so vicious and over the top that it could actually succeed in inflicting severe economic pain even on Westerners. This emotionally charged reaction to the events in Ukraine looks like virtue-signaling gone mad – a particularly worrisome development, given the mob seems incapable of differentiating between the actions of the Russian government and those of its citizens, who, as is the case with every country finding itself in such circumstances, have precious little say in matters related to war and peace. And while it is perfectly natural to loathe war, and to speak out against it, a little consistency would be nice. Since I’ve already explored the question of Western hypocrisy in a previous column, I’ll just touch on it here: Why have the US and its NATO allies never suffered so much as a canceled dentist visit for their illicit military adventures across the Middle East and North Africa?And that brings us to another question: why has it become so acceptable, even fashionable, for people to embrace their inner Klansman whenever the subject is Russia, the global whipping boy? I believe I speak for the majority of Americans when I say we have been methodically conditioned from birth to believe Russians are inherently ruthless and amoral. Much of this conditioning occurs on the television screen and in the movie theater over the duration of a lifetime. Russians find the clichés so ridiculous as to be amusing. To offer just a couple of famous examples, in the 1985 film ‘Rocky IV’, Dolph Lundgren plays the part of Ivan Drago, the icy-cold, expressionless Soviet-Russian boxer who literally beats his opponent, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), to death in the ring without displaying an ounce of remorse. On a lighter but no less effective note, American children were entertained during the Cold War years by the TV series ‘The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends,’ in which the main antagonists are Russian spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale. Such examples of Russians playing the role of evil villains in Hollywood could be cited hundreds if not thousands of times. These racist stereotypes have become so deeply ingrained in the Western brain that most people accept them at face value without thought – which, by the way, is practically the definition of ‘brainwashed.’ It’s interesting to note that Americans – at least from what many Russians have told me – are rarely typecast as the villain in Russian films.In addition to being systematically vilified by Hollywood scriptwriters, Russia has been subjected for many years to a non-stop media smear campaign. From perpetuating the debunked news that the Kremlin played kingmaker by installing Donald Trump in the White House, to falsely accusing Russia of hacking the US power grid at the very peak of torrid AC season, it should come as no surprise that many Americans – aside from feeling nothing but media-generated contempt for Russians – have absolutely no clue what motivated Moscow to initiate its offensive actions in Ukraine in the first place. A person does not have to agree with those motivations, of course, but they should at least be made aware of them. Instead of behaving in the interest of real journalism, however, Google’s YouTube, for instance, banned all channels linked to Russian state media and even the supposedly unbiased search engine DuckDuckGo said it would deliberately down-rank Russian news sites. Like so many others I am sickened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the gigantic humanitarian crisis it continues to create. #StandWithUkraine️At DuckDuckGo, we've been rolling out search updates that down-rank sites associated with Russian disinformation.As far as the mendacious Western media is concerned, Russia woke up on February 24, yawned, stretched, and scratched itself, before deciding then and there that it was a wonderful day to shake up its neighbor. Such a myopic narrative precludes decades of Kremlin warnings, most notably Putin’s now-famous speech at the 2007 Munich Security Conference, in which he told the packed assembly, “NATO expansion … represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust. And we have the right to ask: against whom is this expansion intended?”Far from legacy media and social media using the vast tools at their disposal to keep their readers informed, perhaps even demand some answers from NATO as to why it was so necessary to smash up against Russia’s border, they contributed to political climate change at the worst possible time. Meta Platforms announced that, in the context of Moscow’s military offensive in Ukraine, it would condone on Facebook and Instagram hate speech that called for violence against “invading Russians.” As a thought experiment, would these US-based companies have made such dramatic concessions had American or NATO-ally lives been on the line? It seems doubtful.So, as Russians find themselves increasingly discriminated against in the West, another important question must be asked: Where was this level of hysteria when America and its allies was obliterating various Middle Eastern nations with its “shock and awe” performances that gave rise to a whole new genre of Merriam-Webster-approved euphemisms – gems such as “collateral damage”(dead civilians), “enhanced interrogation techniques” (torture), and “extraordinary rendition” (state-sanctioned kidnappings to “black hole” sites).Setting aside the tricky matter of whether a military response is ever the right response, should a people ever be judged on the actions of their leader? According to a recent poll by the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 70% of the Russian population supports the offensive in Ukraine. Yet military decisions in every country are typically made without the consent of the governed. Historically, the majority of onlookers are tolerant and intelligent enough to separate the actions of a government from those of its citizens. But somehow that sort of rational thinking got tossed out in the Ukrainian conflict, and that is turning into a tragedy not just for Russians, but for mankind."

The senior officer was killed in fighting to “liberate Mariupol from the Nazis,” the lawmaker said, without providing any further detail.The news was confirmed by the Sevastopol governor, Mikhail Razvozhaev, later in the day. Both officials said they knew the officer personally, extending their condolences to his family and friends.“Andrey [Paliy] chose to defend his Motherland as his life’s work and died for our peaceful future,” Razvozhaev said in a Telegram post.The Russian Defense Ministry has so far remained silent on the matter, neither denying nor confirming the demise of the high-ranking commander. According to media reports, Paliy had been overseeing work of a humanitarian corridor, established in Mariupol by the Russian military to evacuate civilians from the besieged city.Moscow attacked the neighboring country in late February following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to regularize the status of the breakaway regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev says the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two rebellious republics by force."

You guys don’t realize the power you have as a council member,” Stein mocked, adding, “If one member decides to stand up and do what’s right and fight for this man right here, Volodymyr Zelensky, you can make the difference.”After asking the council's members whether they would like to “die a nobody” or “die a hero,” Stein jokingly requested that they sign a sheet with their name, social security number, mother’s maiden name, and credit card number – explaining that there would be “a small deposit to make sure that we can reserve your spot on this flight.”“It’s going to give you the ability to defend this country from tyranny, because here in Richardson, Texas, Vladimir Putin is knocking on our door,” the comedian said. “Do you want a nuclear missile coming in your back yard? We need just one councilwoman, one councilman to stand up.”Unsurprisingly, as Stein approached the councilmembers with his sign-up sheet, not a single member was willing to sign their name.Stein has become famous for his viral stunts in front of various city councils and is most well-known for performing comedic rap songs in front of American councilmembers who are obliged to listen for the duration of his designated speaking time."

Switchblade killer drones are part of an additional $800 million military aid package announced by Washington on 16 March. Who is benefitting from the armament spree?,"""One reason for the continued transfer of weapons from NATO nations to Ukraine is to keep the profits of the military industrial complex flowing"", says Bruce Gagnon, coordinator of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space and a contributor to Foreign Policy In Focus. ""The US will 'replace' these weapons to the particular donor country by either charging them for new military equipment or having the US taxpayers pay the bill. Either way, the weapons industry profits big time"". Western defence and cybersecurity stocks began to climb at the end of February as Washington and its NATO allies vowed to step up weapons supplies to Ukraine after the beginning of the Russian special operation, according to Gagnon.  The stocks made substantial progress in slightly over a week and are continuing to rally. Thus, between 24 February and 4 March, defence stocks broadly soared, with shares of Raytheon Technologies rising nearly 8%, General Dynamics 12%, Huntington Ingalls Industries 14%, Lockheed Martin 18%, and Northrop Grumman 22%, according to Fortune. Gagnon notes that Lockheed Martin currently tops the list, followed by other corporations like General Dynamics, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and BAE. However, even before the Russian operation, major US defence contractors started to benefit from Ukraine, with the Biden administration having increased lethal aid to the Eastern European country since the beginning of his presidency. ""In his first year in office, Biden approved more military aid to Ukraine — some $650 million — than the US had ever provided"", The Intercept remarked on 10 March. The US weapons supplies to Ukraine soared substantially in the second half of 2021 amid the Ukrainian military buildup along the contact line with the Donetsk and Lugansk Republics. On 9 March, the Russian Ministry of Defence released secret documents of the command of the National Guard of Ukraine, confirming preparation by Kiev authorities for an offensive operation in Donbass in March 2022. The US defence contractors are the major beneficiaries of US-NATO warmongering, according to Gagnon. Ukraine has long been in the focus of US politicians and the military industrial complex, according to the scholar. Gagnon cites a 2019 RAND Corporation study entitled ""Overextending and Unbalancing Russia"", co-authored by ex-State Department and White House adviser James Dobbins and military intelligence branched lieutenant colonel and Iraq War veteran, Raphael Cohen. ""Providing lethal aid to Ukraine would exploit Russia’s greatest point of external vulnerability"", the study emphasised. According to The Intercept, the Obama administration provided a wide range of ""nonlethal military and intelligence assistance"" to Ukraine, including training, while under Donald Trump, ""Washington began a relatively modest flow of weapons shipments"". Under Biden, arms supplies to Ukraine have already become ""unprecedented"", according to the media outlet. Furthermore, the US political class and defence contractors have become intertwined through Washington's ""revolving door"" politics, notes Gagnon. ""The swinging door between the weapons industry and staff positions inside military and foreign policy institutions is strong evidence of this reality"", he says. ""There is no democracy in the US. WWII Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini defines fascism as 'the wedding of corporations and government'. This is exactly what we have in the US today - and throughout much of Europe as well"". Ironically, it is Joe Biden who declared an end to ""an era of major military operations to remake other countries"" following the US' hasty Afghanistan withdrawal, and stressed that the president’s job is to protect and defend the ""fundamental national security interest of the United States of America"". According to Gagnon, Washington's Ukraine armament spree is caused by the US' unwillingness to completely lose its fading unipolar leadership. However, firm rejection of anti-Russian sanctions by nations throughout the Global South indicates that the West's efforts ""will not be successful"", says the scholar. The Wall Street Journal's recent report saying that Saudi Arabia is considering selling some oil to China using yuan instead of the ""petro-dollar"" shows the demise of the Western-centric world order, according to Gagnon. ""The West's arrogance, greed and sense of exceptionalism are their Achilles' heel"", the scholar concludes. "

Her statement came a week after the country passed a special law giving Ukrainian refugees access to work and education.“Being a refugee is temporary, so you have to return and help build up your homeland when you get the opportunity. It gives us the opportunity to help other refugees,” Frederiksen, a Social Democrat, said during a parliamentary debate, according to the Associated Press.Denmark’s parliament passed a law last Thursday granting two-year residence permits to Ukrainian refugees with an option to extend a further one year. The law also grants refugees access to work permits, education, and social welfare.Although Frederiksen’s government is a coalition of left-wing and center-left parties, it has carried on the strict anti-immigration policies of the preceding right-wing government. Frederiksen has stated that Denmark’s policy is to accept “zero” asylum seekers, and her government has recently demanded that Syrian migrants who arrived during the refugee crisis of 2015 return home.One of the most controversial policies implemented by the right and carried on by the Social Democrats is the so-called “jewelry law,” under which incoming migrants can have their personal belongings seized to cover the costs of their stay in Denmark. A government spokesperson told CNN earlier this month that the law would not be applied to Ukrainians.“We might as well be honest about the fact that we would rather help Ukrainian refugees than Somalians and Palestinians,” former immigration minister Inger Stojberg, whose party passed the law, wrote on Facebook. “No one dares to say it like it is: It's because the Ukrainians are more like us and because they are primarily Christians.”Denmark has also donated several thousand anti-tank weapons to Ukraine and allowed its citizens to volunteer to fight for the Ukrainian military. Defense Minister Morten Bødskov has also offered up Danish troops to any potential future peacekeeping missions in Ukraine. More than 3.4 million people have fled Ukraine since Russian troops entered the country nearly a month ago, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. While Ukraine’s immediate neighbors – including the normally anti-immigration Poland and Hungary – have taken in the bulk of the refugees, other European countries are bending their own immigration rules to prepare for the influx."

Furthermore, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz has warned that the EU will be plunged into recession if it accedes to the US' and others' calls for an immediate end to Russian energy imports.","Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said on Thursday that he “shared” concerns, expressed by an Indian parliamentarian, about western allies playing a “double game” with India by asking the south Asian country to draw down its energy ties with Russia. Gujral went on to ask whether India was contemplating returning to the Cold War-era “rupee trade” with Russia, so that Indian exports aren’t “hurt” and New Delhi could continue to trade with Moscow despite western economic sanctions against Moscow. In his reply to the question, Jaishankar said that the Indian government was “examining various options” to maintain existing commercial relations with Russia. The Indian foreign minister informed Parliament that a group comprising officials from different ministries was looking at various aspects of the trade ties between India and Russia, including the question of rupee trade. He also sadi that “other countries import between 10 and 20 times the amount of oil that we do”. The remarks by the chief Indian diplomat come just a couple of days after US President Joe Biden publicly called out India over its “shaky response” to the Ukraine crisis. While addressing a chief executive officer roundtable at the White House this week, Biden praised the ""united response"" which the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) allies and the US’ partners in the Pacific region had made to Russia's special operation in Ukraine. “The Quad is - with the possible exception of India being somewhat shaky on some of this - but Japan has been extremely strong, so has Australia, in dealing with Putin’s aggression. We presented a united front throughout NATO and the Pacific,” Biden said. Last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki also urged New Delhi against supporting Russia as the western allies push to isolate it economically, politically and culturally in retaliation to Moscow’s ongoing military operation in Ukraine. Psaki was answering a question about reports that India had decided to increase its crude purchases from Moscow, which has offered energy products and commodities to Delhi at a cheaper price. Psaki, however, admitted that sourcing more Russian oil by India won’t violate the US sanctions. ""But also think about where you want to stand when history books are written about this moment in time,” the US official added. Russian President, Vladimir Putin, launched a ""special military operation"" aimed at the ""demilitarisation"" and ""de-Nazification"" of Ukraine on 24 February.  Moscow has said that it would cease its military action if Kiev enshrines a ""neutral"" status in its constitution and pledges that it would never join NATO. After the Russia's operation began, a number of western states imposed sanctions against Moscow. Besides economic sanctions, the US and some eastern European allies such as Poland, urged the EU to ban the imports of Russian oil and other energy products.  The US, which used to source around 4 percent of its oil from Russia, announced a ban on Russian crude and other energy imports this month.   “Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine,” Biden announced this month.   However, Washington’s insistence that EU allies completely cease their Russian imports has been met with little success in Europe, with nations such as Germany and Hungary warning that such a measure could have major economic implications and cause thousands of jobs to be lost.

Despite going along with some of the penalties, the latter three countries challenged a European initiative to place a full-blown embargo on Russian energy earlier this week, voicing concerns it could harm their own oil, gas and coal supplies. Pakistani PM Imran Khan also recently rejected similar Western pressure, saying “I haven’t bowed before anyone and will not let my nation bow either.”Moscow attacked the neighboring state in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

The US president earlier called his Russian counterpart a ""war criminal"". The ministry slammed the remark as ""unacceptable"" and ""unworthy of a statesman of such high rank"", warning Washington that further unfriendly actions would receive a harsh and decisive response. Additionally, the Foreign Ministry said that the issue of Russian diplomatic missions' work in the US has been raised with the American ambassador.   Biden called Putin a ""war criminal"" on Wednesday during his conversation with reporters at the White House. When a journalist asked whether the US president considered his Russian counterpart to be a war criminal, Biden initially responded negatively, but then clarified: ""I think he is a war criminal"".   The remarks prompted a wave of scepticism even among those who largely shared Washington's official position on the ongoing Ukrainian crisis. After being reached out to for clarification on Biden's stance, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the US president ""was speaking from his heart and speaking from what he's seen on television"". The West, including the United States, has condemned Russia's military operation in Ukraine and imposed harsh sanctions on Moscow, demanding that the Kremlin immediately stop the operation. Russia, in its turn, has underlined that the goal of the operation is to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine and said that its troops do not pose any threat to civilians, as only Ukrainian military infrastructure is being targeted. In early March, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that it was ""important"" for Washington to preserve diplomatic relations with Russia, even in the wake of the US calling on Americans to promptly leave Russia and refrain from trips there as the US government’s opportunities to help them if necessary are limited.

In their joint venture, the mining firms plan to drill a total of 3,000 meters in 2022 at depths of between 150 to 400 meters to get to where the metals are located.“The objective is to target massive nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum group metals,” Bluejay CEO Bo Stensgaard told Reuters.The ambitious project comes as prices for metals, especially nickel, used in electric vehicle batteries more than doubled earlier in March amid Western sanctions imposed on Russia following its military operation in Ukraine. Russia supplies around 10% of the world’s nickel needs, as well as 4% of cobalt. It is also the world’s 8th largest copper producer and 4th largest supplier of platinum.“The recent unfortunate geopolitical developments clearly show that the Western world needs new deposits of these critical metals,” Stensgaard said.KoBold is famous for utilizing artificial intelligence and cloud computing techniques to predict the composition of the subsurface in the hunt for raw materials. The firm says its goal is to “fully electrify the global economy” and start an “electric vehicle revolution.” The project is backed by notable billionaires such as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Ray Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

Ads on Twitter, Facebook and Google are geolocated to the Russian embassy and encourage recipients to divulge information to the US security agency.The campaign, which an ""expert"" cited by the newspaper called “clever and sophisticated”, is apparently focused on Russian ""spies"" presumably working under diplomatic cover at the embassy. It highlights an exchange between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Security Service chief Sergey Naryshkin during last month’s meeting of the National Security Council.The top body was discussing on camera whether to recognize Ukraine’s breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as sovereign states, with each member stating his or her opinion. Naryshkin at one point seemed confused about what was being discussed and suggested Russia should annex the two entities. Putin reminded him such a proposal was not under consideration.“Speak plainly,” the president told the intelligence head as he was struggling to express his position.The Russian-language ad features photos of Putin and Naryshkin during the meeting and encourages readers to “speak plainly” to the FBI. The link goes to the webpage of the counterintelligence program of the Bureau’s Washington Field Office.It’s not clear if the campaign, which the newspaper concluded to be a form of trolling of Russian intelligence officers into disliking Putin, was an efficient recruitment technique. Peter Lapp, a former FBI spy-hunter, told the paper that he believed the strategy to be “brilliant”.“It’s also nice to see the FBI using 21st-century technology to do this, since the FBI is not usually known for its technological advances,” he said, adding that at the very least the ads could waste Russian resources on trying to identify people who would click on them.US tech giants have been instrumental in America’s campaign to discredit the Russian government’s rationale for attacking Ukraine. For example, they have collaborated with Western governments in banning Russian media outlets. Earlier this month, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Russian diplomatic missions in the US had been living under pressure for years and “under siege for the last several months.” She said staff members regularly received threats against themselves and their family members."

It is clear that at the moment it is unrealistic to impose sanctions in this area,"" Iohannis told a press conference. According to Iohannis, countries cannot impose sanctions that will hit them much harder than Russia. Earlier this month, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that even discussing Europe's refusal of Russian oil is negative for the market, as it immediately reacts. Without Russian oil and gas the global economy will collapse, and prices will be unpredictable, according to Novak. This week, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia will be transferring payments for gas supplies to ""unfriendly countries"" into rubles, at the same time stressing that Russia would continue to supply gas in volumes and at prices fixed in earlier contracts, as the country values  its reputation. A series of Western countries have introduced new sanctions against Russia amid its operation in Ukraine. A number of companies have announced their withdrawal from the Russian market and the closure of production facilities in Russia. As the Kremlin said earlier in the month, the Western sanctions are very serious and Russia was preparing for them in advance. It requires analysis and coordination of agencies to work out the response measures corresponding with Russia's interests. Earlier in the month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the policy of restraining and weakening Russia is a long-term strategy of the West and sanctions have dealt a serious blow to the entire global economy. The main goal of the West is to worsen the lives of millions of people. The president also said that the US and the EU have defaulted on their obligations to Russia, freezing its foreign exchange reserves. Current events draw a line under the global dominance of the West in both politics and economics, the Russian leader said. "

The company has explained that the letter has come to represent support for the Kremlin’s military campaign against Ukraine, hence the Swiss insurer’s anxiety to avoid any misunderstanding.The new version of the insurance company’s logo is similar to the original one in design, except, instead of the letter Z, it sports the word Zurich in full.In a statement to Reuters, Zurich Insurance Group said that it was “temporarily removing the use of the letter ‘Z’ from social channels where it appears in isolation and could be misinterpreted.” The company also noted that it would “take further actions if and when required.”Zurich Insurance announced earlier this month that it was suspending its operations in Russia, not taking on new customers or renewing existing local business in the country. In January several media outlets reported that the Swiss insurer had pulled out of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project for fear that it could be targeted by US sanctions. However, the project was stopped the next month anyway, following the start of Russia’s military campaign against its neighbor.The letter Z, along with V and several others, were first spotted on Russian military hardware in late February, when President Vladimir Putin launched a military offensive against Ukraine. Although there has been no official comment so far as to what these letters stand for, the letter Z in particular appears to have become a symbol of support for the Kremlin’s actions, at least in Russia. Individuals and, in some cases, regional authorities have been displaying the symbol on vehicles, billboards and even on buildings."

While making it clear that he does not foresee any such sanctions being imposed on India, Das did acknowledge that the action taken by the US has probably provoked every country to re-examine the composition of their forex reserves. Last month, Russia's military operation in Ukraine resulted in severe sanctions being imposed on the $1.7-trillion-economy, impacting transactions in most sectors except energy and pharma. The US and European Union, besides imposing sanctions on political leaders and businessmen, have frozen the Central Bank's assets stashed in different parts of the world. The West's decision has been dubbed an ""economic war"" by the Kremlin. It limits the Central Bank's ability to intervene in the currency market, where the ruble has recorded a drastic fall against the US dollar. On Monday, Shaktikanta Das assured industrialists and concerned people about India's well-distributed forex reserves in many currencies. ""We decided to diversify our reserves to other currencies not now but six months back. So I don't think this (sanctions) is a major problem for us"", Das underlined. On 17 March, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and ex-governor of the RBI said that fear of ""indiscriminate sanctions"" by the US could see China, India, and others limiting their holdings in the advanced economy. India's forex reserves were $622.275 billion as of 11 March; most of this is in US dollars, while the value of gold reserves is $43.8 billion. "

The minister also said Russia was not against Western countries' eagerness to play some kind of mediating role in the current crisis. ""But we have absolutely clear red lines, which we have been talking about for many years,"" he said. Lavrov suggested that current Western moves, such as the provision of advanced anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine, will surely have a blowback effect, among them deliveries of ""additional Stingers, which are a colossal threat, because they will undoubtedly spread all over Europe."" The foreign minister also commented on the prospects of a NATO ""peacekeeping force"" in Ukraine, warning that such a move would lead to direct clashes with Russian forces. Lavrov also brought up the topic of US-financed biological laboratories in the former USSR, saying the Pentagon's interest in Soviet-era biolabs in Kazakhstan ""requires clarification."" ""We are now completing the preparation of a memorandum of cooperation in the field of biology with our Kazakh friends...I hope that we will resolve these issues with Kazakhstan,"" he said. Commenting on Western countries' move to seize over $300 billion in assets from Russia's reserve cushion, which wound up in Western countries for reasons as yet unclear, Lavrov characterised the freeze as plain ""theft"".  ""When the central bank's reserves were frozen, no one among those who predicted what sanctions the West might apply could even think of this. It's just theft,"" Lavrov said. In the future, Lavrov said, Russia must not depend on the West as it has in the past, but be ready to cooperate on equal terms. ""[We need] clarity which will be based on the absence of any dependence on the West in the future. If they want to cooperate, of course we will not step back from this, if it is based on an equal footing, in both our interests, if there is a balance of interests."" Russia, the minister suggested, has sufficient material resources and talented people to be self-sufficient. ""We have a huge country, resources, brains, everything we need to be self-sufficient, but at the same time open up to the outside world for mutually beneficial projects."" "

Biden said of President Putin, “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.”An unidentified White House official quickly tried to clarify the US position, saying Biden’s point was that Putin can’t be allowed to exercise power over neighboring countries. On Sunday, Blinken continued the effort to walk back Biden’s comments.“I think the president, the White House, made the point last night that, quite simply, President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else,” Blinken told reporters. “As you know, and as you have heard us say repeatedly, we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia – or anywhere else, for that matter.”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to Biden’s speech, saying, “It’s not up to the president of the US and not up to the Americans to decide who will remain in power in Russia. Only Russians, who vote for their president, can decide that.”During his visit to Israel, Blinken claimed to agree with that position, saying, “In this case, as in any case, it’s up to the people of the country in question. It’s up to the Russian people.”The US has a history of regime-change wars and interventions around the world, including relatively recent campaigns in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. In fact, the State Department helped overthrow Ukraine’s elected leader in 2014, triggering war with separatists in the former Soviet republic.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to abide by terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

The MoD has published correspondence between the US President’s son and employees of the US Department of Defense Threat Reduction Office, as well as Pentagon contractors in Ukraine. The emails suggest that Hunter Biden was instrumental in raising funds for the American contractors, Black &amp; Veatch and Metabiota, enabling the companies to engage in pathogen studies on the territory of Ukraine, stated the head of the Russian radiation, chemical and biological defense forces, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov. It also follows from the correspondence that the goals of the Pentagon in Ukraine are far from scientific, underscored the Russian Defense Ministry. Igor Kirillov recalled that earlier, in the course of Russia’s special operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine, the military had seized documents that revealed an ongoing scheme of interaction between US government agencies, the current military-political leadership of the United States with Ukrainian biolabs. In particular, the documentary evidence pointed to the involvement of an investment fund managed by Hunter Biden in financing high-risk biological research in Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry has also presented the names of US officials involved in the creation of bioweapons components in Ukraine. One of these was Robert Pope, at the time Director of the US Defense Department's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at DTRA, which had sought to draw post-Soviet states into biological warfare, stated Major General Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, at Thursday's briefing. Pope spearheaded the idea of ​​​​creating a ""Central Depository of Especially Dangerous Microorganisms in Kiev,"" the general added. Joanna Wintrall, the head of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) office at the US embassy in Kiev, led the coordination of military biological projects in Ukraine, Konashenkov said. Furthermore, Lance Lippencott, Program Director at the Ukrainian division of the company Black &amp; Veatch, acted as the main contact for officials of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense and Health Ministry, said Konashenkov. According to him, Black &amp; Veatch has been working in the interests of the Pentagon since 2008 as an inherent part of projects studying potentially dangerous bioagents. Among these was the UP-1 project to study rickettsia and tick-borne encephalitis virus in arthropods in northwestern Ukraine. In the course of the UP-2 project, the company introduced a system for remote monitoring of the incidence of tularemia and anthrax at Ukrainian biological facilities, said the Russian general, adding: The MoD then revealed that Ukrainian engine maker Motor Sich asked the manufacturers of Turkish Bayraktar drones about the possibility of using the UAVs to spray deadly substances, which raises concerns in the light of the American military biological programme developed in Ukraine. Igor Kirillov stressed that the document on this request is dated 15 December 2021, with Motor Sich wondering if it's possible to equip Bayraktar drones with systems and mechanisms for spraying aerosols with a capacity of more than 20 liters. He emphasised that such a UAV with a flight range of 300 kilometers could pose a real threat of contamination of the territory of Russia. Russia's MoD has previously shed light on the fact that the US spent more than $200 million on the work of biological laboratories in Ukraine, which were a part of the American military biological programme and dealt, in particular, with plague and anthrax pathogens. The freshly-provided damning correspondence comes as the Russian military has spent weeks shedding light on research into deadly pathogens being conducted in Ukrainian laboratories under the direction of the Pentagon and with US funding. Initially, the MoD's reporting was dismissed by Washington as ""Russian disinformation"", with both officials and media since then corroborating many of the assertions. According to Konashenkov, the Russian militarywould be continuing its analysis of documents received from employees of Ukraine-based biological laboratories, including the secret military biological activities being conducted in the country by the US.

","With Volodymyr Zelensky's address to Italian MPs slated for 22 March, several members from Italy's ruling coalition of the 5 Star Movement and the League ""would like to hear"" Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Italian Parliament ""as well"" in order ""to counterbalance"" the Ukrainian president, according to La Repubblica. The newspaper recalled that it was previously announced that Zelensky would speak before the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Italian Parliament, via a video link next Tuesday, amid Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. Lawmaker Nicola Grimaldi told La Repubblica that he would like to ""invite"" Putin to address the Italian Parliament via a video call after Zelensky's speech, something that was also welcomed by Grimaldi's colleagues Davide Serritella and Gabriele Lorenzoni. As for Grimaldi, he, along with four other colleagues from the 5 Star Movement and the League coalition, recently voted against a bill stipulating that Italy send ""non-lethal"" military help to Ukraine in a show of support for Kiev against Moscow. The developments come as Russia continues its special military operation in Ukraine, which was announced by President Putin on 24 February and aims to demilitarise and de-Nazify the country. The operation was launched after a request for help from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) amid continuing shelling of their positions and infrastructure by the Ukrainian Army. The operation is only targeting Ukraine's military infrastructure with high-precision weapons, posing no threat to the civilian population, according to the Russian Defence Ministry. Moscow and Kiev are currently in talks to resolve the conflict, with Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky on Friday stressing that the sides have made progress on several issues during the negotiations, including Ukraine's neutral status and its non-entry to NATO. He added that ""the nuances are related to what security guarantees Ukraine can receive in addition to existing ones, in case of its refusal to join NATO"". The statement came after Putin said earlier this week that the special operation is going as planned and that the tactics mapped out by the Russian Defence Ministry and the General Staff had justified themselves.

Several other former top officials, including ex-finance minister Vladislav Goranov, were also reportedly arrested.The Bulgarian Interior Ministry said in a statement that it was carrying out “a large-scale law enforcement operation… in connection with 120 cases of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office.”European Chief Prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi, who was on a two-day visit to Sofia earlier this week, announced that her agency was investigating numerous instances of possible mishandling of EU aid by Bulgaria’s former cabinet in such areas as public procurement, agriculture, construction and recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic.“Now is the time for the relevant Bulgarian authorities to team up with us, including on particularly sensitive cases,” she urged.Borisov, who now leads the opposition Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party, is the EU country’s second-longest serving prime minister. The 62-year-old served from 2009 to 2013 and from 2017 to 2021. His last years in office were marred by a corruption scandal and massive protests calling for his resignation.The political veteran’s lawyer told local media that Borisov had been held for 24 hours on suspicion of blackmail. Bulgaria’s current Prime Minister Kiril Petkov had also been questioned as a witness in the case, he added.On Thursday, Petkov posted a short message on Facebook, reading: “Nobody is above the law!” The head of government didn’t provide any context, but he was most likely referring to the detention of Borisov and his associates."

He defended his government’s efforts to keep prices down, but insisted that he has “no magical answer” to the problem, and that the public will “without a doubt” have to deal with some hardship.Since Russian troops entered Ukraine over a month ago, Macron has portrayed himself as one of Europe’s foremost geopolitical players: Speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin personally, doing photoshoots in a military sweatshirt after negotiations, and last week announcing a yet-to-happen operation to evacuate the Ukrainian city of Mariupol “in the coming days.”However, with the first round of presidential elections coming up on April 10, Macron headed to the city of Dijon on Monday to meet voters – some of whom were more concerned with domestic issues than a conflict 2,000km away.“Put yourself in the shoes of an ordinary French family, it’s terrible,” one man told the president. “It’s horrible to do the shopping, to fill up your tank. I used to get decent pay, I was able to go on holiday, save money. But that’s no longer the case, I’ve become a low-income worker!“How can you fill a tank with fuel if it costs €140 ($155),” the man continued, “it’s monstrous!”Macron’s answer was firm. “I have no magical answer,” he replied. “The increase in fixed costs is a tragedy for the middle classes.”The president defended his government’s allocation of €2 billion ($2.2 billion) toward fuel rebates – a spending hike that gives motorists around 15 cents off a liter of fuel, and boasted of similar moves to offset rising electricity costs – which had already soared to record levels long before Russia’s offensive in Ukraine sent shockwaves through global energy markets.“If you take electricity, if we hadn’t taken measures your bill wouldn’t just have increased like gas, it would have doubled,” Macron told the man. “When there is an increase in the prices of everything at the world level, and also a war begins, which complicates everything, the prices of everything skyrocket.”“You are talking to me about Ukraine, but what if tomorrow Putin decides to turn off the gas valve for us? What then?” the man countered. “It’s easy to say, ‘Reduce the temperature in your homes by one or two degrees,’ but I already did it, without waiting for someone to tell me this.”“Without a doubt, this will have to be done,” Macron admitted, echoing similar comments by officials in Germany. There, Baden-Wurttemberg Minister of Agriculture and Consumer Protection Peter Hauk told citizens to get used to wearing sweaters to deal with the cold after he backed a complete ban on Russian oil and gas imports.Rising fuel prices have rocked Macron’s entire presidency, with a tax hike in 2018 triggering years of near-weekly ‘Yellow Vest’ protests that grew into a show of dissatisfaction with his neoliberal economic policies. Despite persistently low approval ratings and the current spike in living costs, however, Macron is projected to win the first round of elections next month.If successful, he would likely face off against right-wing stalwart Marine Le Pen, a showdown that polls show him winning, albeit less comfortably than he did in 2017."

After that, we are suspending the publication of the newspaper on the website, in [social] networks and in print – until the end of the ‘special operation on the territory of Ukraine’,” the outlet said in a brief statement.The outlet received the second warning from the regulator in a week on Monday. The notice came after the newspaper mentioned an unspecified “foreign agent” entity in one of its articles without identifying it as such, TASS reported. The first warning was lodged by Roskomnadzor last Tuesday over a similar issue related to coverage by “foreign agents.”The newspaper’s team will spend the time off searching for new formats and exploring “new genres,” Novaya Gazeta’s editor-in-chief, 2021 Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov has said.“The team is wonderful. And while the publishing is suspended, they will think about what new genres, products, and things they can do,” he told TASS.Muratov has openly opposed Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, announcing last week that he would donate his Nobel medal to an auction to help Ukrainian refugees. The “foreign agents” legislation that ultimately led to the “temporary” suspension of Novaya Gazeta’s activities has been repeatedly targeted by the journalist as well. Apart from promising to funnel his Nobel Peace Prize money to help people who were accorded that label, he urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to revisit the “vague” and “extrajudicial legislation.”Multiple media outlets critical of Russia’s authorities have fallen victim to the ongoing offensive in Ukraine, launched by Moscow last month. Early in March, Moscow’s liberal Telekanal Dozhd (TV Rain) “temporarily suspended” broadcasts after it was blocked by the regulator for alleged false reporting of the conflict.A similar fate has befallen another popular liberal outlet, the Echo of Moscow radio station, which was accused of calling for “extremism” and of spreading “false information about the actions of the Russian military in Ukraine.” The outlet was shut down after a “majority vote” of its board of directors.Moscow launched a large-scale offensive against its neighbor Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military alliance. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the Donbass by force."

The methods we have witnessed may be liberal to you, but to many citizens around the🌎it seemed like a dictatorship of the worst kind. pic.twitter.com/FZuc6aDZ1I“We watched how you trample women with horses,” said Kolakusic. “How you block the bank accounts of single parents so that they can’t even pay their children’s education and medicine… utilities, mortgages for their homes.”To you, these may be liberal methods. For many citizens of the world, it is a dictatorship of the worst kindKolakusic concluded by warning Trudeau that “the citizens of the world united can stop any regime that wants to destroy the freedom of citizens.”Trudeau – who was in attendance for the speech and delivered his own address about “peace and security” and “defending democracy” – could be seen watching on silently.Canada received international criticism last month after it took drastic and authoritarian measures to shut down the peaceful ‘Freedom Convoy’ protests in Ottawa against Covid-19 restrictions and mandates.One viral video at the time showed mounted police trampling protesters, while others showed officers pepper spraying journalists and beating unarmed demonstrators to the ground. Those associated with the protests also had their bank accounts frozen after Trudeau implemented emergency powers.The prime minister arrived in Brussels, Belgium on Wednesday to meet with the leaders of the European Union, NATO, and G7 to discuss their “coordinated response” to Russia’s offensive in Ukraine. The trip is scheduled to conclude on Friday."

To date, 1,351 servicemen have died and 3,825 have been injured,” the deputy head of the Russian General Staff, Colonel General Sergey Rudskoy told a media briefing. The official did not provide any figures on soldiers who have potentially gone missing in action or been taken prisoner amid the conflict. The Ukrainian side has sustained heavy casualties (around 30,000) over the past month, Rudskoy clarified. According to Russian military estimates, around 14,000 Ukrainian troops have been killed, and a further 16,000 have been injured.Ukraine’s military has sustained major losses in hardware, with nearly 1,600 tanks and other armored vehicles destroyed, he alleged, adding that the Russian offensive has largely destroyed Kiev’s air and anti-aircraft forces, while its navy has effectively ceased to exist.The official casualty figures provided by the Russian military differ drastically from the estimates from the Ukrainian side. According to the latest claims by Kiev, around 16,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the conflict, with hundreds of tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery pieces destroyed.Kiev, however, remains tight-lipped on its own casualties. The most recent figure was announced by President Volodymyr Zelensky in mid-March, when he said that around 1,300 Ukrainian soldiers had died in combat.Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

Even if they apologize later, even if they take me back into the Candidates Tournament, I’ll create my own organization…“We’ll create a good, professional team, we will work with permanent sponsors. All the good things that FIDE does, I’m talking about the World Championship, about holding tournaments, we’ll transfer all this to our organization with a large prize fund.“We’ll wait for anyone who wants [to join]. I’ve been nurturing this idea since yesterday, I’ve already discussed it with some people, I’ve already enlisted some kind of support.“Plus, ordinary people, and this is very important to me, they ask me, they say: ‘Let’s do it, we will support it.’“So that not everything can be decided only by an order from above. It’s very important for me that ordinary people support me.”Karjakin has received support from the Chess Federation of Russia in the aftermath of his ban, with the organization vowing to appeal the suspension. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also urged FIDE to reconsider the ban, describing it as “political.”Born in Simferopol, Karjakin switched allegiances from Ukraine to Russia in 2009.He is a former world rapid and blitz chess champion, and pushed Carlsen all the way in their epic world championship meeting in New York in 2016 before falling in a tiebreak series.A vocal supporter of President Putin, Karjakin issued an open letter to the Russian leader at the onset of the military operation in Ukraine, wishing the armed forces success.“It is fighting for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine with its ruling regime, which has put the security of all of Europe and our country at risk, for the sake of its political goals and ambitions,” wrote Karjakin.“I am closely following the ongoing special operation, in the lands where I spent my childhood, where I learned to play chess and where my relatives still live.“For eight long years we have been waiting with hope for salvation from countless shelling and loss of human lives, the ongoing genocide by the still acting Kiev regime.“I express to you, our commander-in-chief, full support in protecting the interests of Russia, our multinational Russian people, eliminating threats and establishment of peace! I wish you the speedy fulfilment of all the tasks assigned to our valiant army.”Karjakin said he and his family had received death threats in light of his stance, although he also said he had been given messages of support.FIDE announced on March 16 that it was banning Russia and Belarus from its team tournaments until further notice, but said players from the two countries would be able to compete as individuals under neutral status and the FIDE flag.  "

I want to train, to perform, to show my maximum at each competition, because it energizes me,” Shcherbakova said, according to TASS. That news will come as a welcome relief to Shcherbakova’s legion of fans in Russia and beyond, following concerns trigged by her comments at the Channel One Cup in her homeland last weekend.“I think [the situation] is not only confusing for me. No one knows what awaits us, so I will look at the situation,” Shcherbakova had said after captaining her team to victory at the exhibition event in Saransk.  “For now, I just want to take a break from this season and recover, because although it was successful, with bright moments, it was difficult for everyone.“I want to take a breather, and then we will already make a decision closer to the new season.”When asked if the uncertain future for Russians at international events would be a factor in her decision, Shcherbakova had replied: “Perhaps it will directly affect my decision, yes.”Shcherbakova and her fellow Russian stars are currently in limbo after the ban imposed by the International Skating Union (ISU) on March 1 after Moscow launched its military offensive in Ukraine.That decision forced Russian and Belarusian skaters to miss the recent World Championships in Montpellier, France, where Shcherbakova would have been the defending champion in the women’s singles event."

Before playing the clip, however, Cooper felt obliged to do a bit of explaining for viewers just in case they should get the wrong (sic) idea. He said the Ukrainian soldiers who are heard repeatedly shouting “Allahu Akbar” were actually Chechen volunteers who had signed up to fight against Russia. So our kindly CNN host is trying to contrive an apologetic distinction here. Shouting “Allahu Akbar” is “OK” if you are from Chechnya, he implies, as opposed to Saudi Arabia or some other place more associated with Islamic terrorists in Western public perception. Forbid the subversive thought that there may be no distinction. The Islamist slogan is a well-known rallying cry used by Jihadist terror groups affiliated with Al Qaeda* outfits like Nusra Front* and Daesh* who recruit fighters from all over the world. During the Syrian war, these militants would often release propaganda videos depicting fighters firing off weapons and shouting the slogan. Chechnya in Russia’s southern Caucasus region is a stronghold of Islamist terror groups that Moscow battled against during the late 1990s and 2000s. The same militants were responsible for terrorist atrocities against civilians in the Russian capital such as the theater hostage in 2002 when 171 people were killed. The similarity with the Mariupol theater incident in Ukraine last week is notable. Chechen fighters were an important fighting element in the Western-backed war for regime change in Syria. Western media like CNN covered up the links between the US and NATO governments and the terror groups who were doing their bidding to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad. That covert war failed because of Russia’s military intervention in support of the Syrian nation from the end of 2015 onwards. Getting back to CNN’s video clip this week from Ukraine, what the American cable news channel is doing is inadvertently admitting that Chechen Jihadists are fighting in support of the Kiev regime. Secondly, it shows too that the Western media and governments are in effect back to their unspoken Syrian war policy of supporting the Jihadists – albeit lionizing them as “fighters against Russia” in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a military intervention in Ukraine on 24 February because the Kiev regime was attacking Russian-speaking populations for eight years. The United States and its NATO partners weaponized Ukraine deliberately to threaten Russia’s security. NATO special forces from the US, Britain and Canada held training camps in Ukraine for Nazi fighters. This is consistent with how the US and its allies covertly backed the Third Reich’s Nazi remnants in the Gehlen Organization after the Second World War in Soviet territories. Moscow says that its war in Ukraine will continue until the country is neutralized as a military threat. That means no NATO membership or presence and the elimination of Nazi paramilitaries that form the backbone of the Kiev regime since the CIA-orchestrated coup in 2014. In other words, the present war could have been averted if Washington and its NATO allies had refrained from their systematic hostile policy towards Russia. If Russia’s proposals for a security treaty had been respected and negotiated reasonably the present crisis would have been avoided. Ever since the 2014 CIA-backed coup d’état in Kiev when an elected Ukrainian president was violently overthrown, the Western media like CNN have systematically ignored the reality of the Nazi paramilitaries underpinning the regime. The Azov Battalion and their ilk are now presented as some kind of noble resistance movement against “Russian aggression”. Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian comedian-turned-president, is flagged up by Western media for his Jewish ancestry as somehow a countervailing narrative, instead of the possibility that he is simply a puppet for the CIA and its Nazi militants who actually run the country. Ironically, US President Joe Biden has lately been lecturing China, India and others to be “on the right side of history” by joining the Western campaign to condemn Russia over the conflict in Ukraine. It is grotesque for an American president to label others as war criminals when we look at how the Americans wage criminal war after criminal war, flattening cities like Fallujah, Mosul and Raqqa to prosecute their illicit objectives. It’s also grotesque for American and European governments and their media to pontificate about the “right side of history” when they are openly supporting Nazis and now we can see Jihadist terrorists in Ukraine – just like they did covertly during their regime-change war in Syria. The astounding Western duplicity and hypocrisy are only possible when the propaganda machine that is Western media is allowed to run its “programs” full throttle without any intelligent media challenge. That’s why the US and European Union are doing everything to censor and shut down Russian news media. It is incredible but nevertheless illuminating that today, the Western public is prevented from accessing RT and Sputnik news websites via open sources of the internet. The draconian censorship is necessitated because the shocking truth is the Western governments and their media are on the ugly side of history from weaponizing and glorifying Nazis and head-chopping terrorists in Ukraine. *Daesh (IS/ISIS/ISIL), Al-Qaeda, Nusra Front are terrorist organisations banned in Russia.

Alexey Danilov was appearing live on Kiev's 1+1 TV station late on Saturday.The senior official said that, should new conflicts break out between Russia and third parties, these scenarios would provide “quality support” to Ukraine in trying to fend off Moscow's ongoing military assault.Georgia could become one such party, Danilov suggested, criticizing the neutral stance taken by Tbilisi, which fought a brief war with Russia, in 2008. The Georgian leadership has abstained from imposing anti-Russian sanctions, arguing that such a step would only harm the country’s own economy.“Georgia is behaving not very appropriately, to put it mildly,” the official said, calling on the Salome Zourabichvili government to try and “return” territories. Danilov was apparently referring to South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which broke away from Tbilisi in the 1990s and are recognized as independent by Russia.“But, what if both Pridnestrovie [another name for Transnistria, an enclave internationally recognised as part of Moldova], and Georgia, and everyone would embark onto returning their territories today,” Danilov asked. A Russian peacekeeping force has been stationed for decades in Transnistria. “This would definitely help us, because that would make them busy with something besides destroying our cities and villages, killing our children and women.”Danilov’s warlike calls, however, have met a cold reception in Georgia, with multiple politicians firmly rejecting such ideas. An MP from the ruling Georgian Dream party and the head of Georgia’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, Nikoloz Samharadze, even expressed doubts such statements could have been produced by that senior official at all.“I hope this is a lie. Does the Secretary of the Security Council of Ukraine call on Georgia and others to abandon the policy of peaceful restoration of their territorial integrity, opening a second front to destroy our cities and villages, so that Georgian women and children die too? Is this true?” Samkharadze wondered in a social media post.A similar sentiment was expressed by another MP from the Georgian Dream party, Mikhail Sardzhveladze, who said that igniting more conflicts “will not help or become a relief for Ukraine”Danilov also approved of the idea to claim the Kaliningrad region from Russia, voiced earlier this week by ex-commander of the Polish Land Forces, General Waldemar Skrzypczak. The general claimed that the formerly German region, which ended up under Russian rule after the defeat of the Nazis in World War Two, was, in fact, Polish land.The remarks prompted widespread condemnation in Russia, with the governor of the region, Anton Alikhanov, warning the Polish general that his country should not raise territorial claims, given that “a very large part of land that is now Poland, in fact, was conquered, claimed from Nazi Germany and transferred as a gift from the Soviet to the Polish people [by Joseph Stalin's regime].”"

US President Joe Biden has tried to pressure Chinese leader Xi Jinping to join Washington’s campaign to isolate Russia. But Beijing told the Americans to shove their Cold War delusions. ,"Biden’s call with President Xi last Friday was an attempt to look big and strong, warning China that if it helped Russia mitigate Western economic sanctions then China could also face similar American financial punishment. It’s a sign of the times of declining US global power that China effectively told the American side to wind their necks in. “China will not be coerced by anyone,” said its foreign minister Wang Yi commenting on the earlier video call between the two leaders. The American political class is so out of tune with reality. It seems to still think that whatever they say is a writ for the rest of the world to obey. But the rest of the world is learning to ignore the US duplicity and blatant attempt to dominate through diktat. President Vladimir Putin and President Xi unveiled a strategic partnership last month that precisely rejects US hegemonic ambitions and Cold War geopolitics of divide and conquer. Russia and China are calling for a multipolar international order based on mutual partnership and respect. Such a vision is intolerable for US-led Western capitalism. Beijing understands that the ongoing conflict in Ukraine is a direct result of American and NATO hostility towards Russia. Years of aggression and destabilization through supporting Neo-Nazi paramilitaries like the Azov Battalion have blown up into the present violence. For Biden to arrogantly demand Xi to join Western economic warfare against Russia is American hubris taken to sublime levels. Washington has succeeded in getting its European vassals to shoot themselves in the foot by thwarting energy trade with Russia. Now, the Americans want China to do the same. China’s global economic power is driven by a vast supply of Russian gas and oil. The Americans want to sabotage China’s ascent as an economic power to offset their own historic demise as a bankrupt capitalist has-been, and for that Washington is demanding Beijing to forfeit its relations with Moscow. You could hardly make this American conceit up. China can see through the nauseating hypocrisy of Biden and others in Washington. The American posturing and pontificating towards Russia about alleged violations of international law in Ukraine are sickeningly absurd given the litany of criminal wars and destruction from the US and its NATO gangsters. Biden himself is personally responsible for facilitating criminal wars in dozens of countries during his decades-long political career in Washington. But it’s not just about hypocrisy. The fact is the Americans and their unipolar hegemonic mindset and ambitions of dominance have led to the crisis in Ukraine. China understands that the only way to avoid conflict is for a mutual security treaty to be established for Europe, one that involves mutual negotiations with Russia. But such negotiations and security treaty are anathema to the Cold War logic of Washington and its NATO partners. Russia tried to negotiate through diplomatic proposals but was continually rebuffed by the US and NATO. Another crucial aspect of America’s delusions about pitting China against Russia is that Beijing knows full well that the very same nefarious game is being played by Washington with regard to Taiwan. The Americans are brazenly weaponizing the island territory to undermine China’s national security and strategic balance. Even though Washington officially recognizes Taiwan as an integral part of China under Beijing’s sovereignty, the Americans are doing everything to inflame tensions between the mainland and the island. The US under Biden is weaponizing Taiwan with the apparent objective of inciting conflict with China. This is analogous to what Washington and its NATO allies have done to Ukraine. When Biden tried to lecture Xi last week about China being expected to not support Russia what the American was trying to do was pressure Beijing with moral blackmail to join US-led efforts to subjugate Russia. The Americans are so full of their own self-righteous arrogance and propaganda they don’t even realize when they look stupid. President Xi reportedly gave Biden a brush-off and reminded him of China’s priority concern over America’s nefarious machinations on Taiwan. China supports Russia as a matter of international principle and shared vision of a more viable global order based not on American hegemony, but rather on mutual respect. China also knows that if Washington were to ever succeed in somehow subjugating Russia to its diktat, the US would move quickly to target China for its next act of imperialist bullying. Joe Biden is the personification of US presumed global power: frail and oblivious to its own demise in a changing world. Ordering China around is like a drunk in the Last Chance Saloon ordering another round he can no longer pay for. "

A further 4.95 million deaths were indirectly associated with antimicrobial resistance in the analysis of 204 countries and territories.A review of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that was commissioned by the UK government has warned that, by 2050, an extra 10 million people will die each year from drug-resistant infections."

Empire Company Ltd., which owns several supermarket chains including Sobeys, Safeway, and FreshCo, began pulling made-in-Russia products from shelves earlier this month. Metro Inc. also said they had stopped selling Russian items in March, as well as Loblaw Companies Ltd. It is unclear, however, if Walmart Canada followed suit, while Costco Canada refused to comment on the campaign, the report said. The list of items removed includes kvass malt beer, candy, and, of course, various brands of Russian vodka - which is the second most popular spirit in the country after whiskey. According to Statistics Canada data, in 2021 alone Canada imported CAD$4.8 million ($3.78 million) worth of alcoholic beverages from Russia. The campaign against Russian products comes as a response to a special operation in Ukraine, launched by Moscow in February. Russia started the op in order to stop the eight-year-long war in Donbass, with the Defence Ministry stressing that Russian forces are only targeting Ukrainian military objects.

Washington created a special Task Force, KleptoCapture, to oversee the implementation of sanctions against Moscow and seize the assets of individuals and entities who violate them.Confidence in reserve currencies is “fading like the morning mist,” and the prospect of abandoning the dollar and euro in this role does not seem like such an unrealistic prospect anymore, he said. “The era of regional currencies is coming.”Russia said that from March 31, it will only accept payments for gas in rubles from “unfriendly countries,” which include the US and EU, while China and Saudi Arabia have been discussing switching to the yuan in their oil trade.“No matter if they want it or not, they’ll have to negotiate a new financial order,” Medvedev said. “And the decisive voice will then be with those countries that have a strong and advanced economy, healthy public finances and a reliable monetary system. And not with those who endlessly inflate their public debt, issuing more and more pieces of paper into circulation which aren’t backed by national wealth.”"

Medvedev wrote in a Telegram post that Washington has tried to ""humiliate, limit, divide and destroy"" Russia. According to Dmitry Medvedev, Washington has made it its mission to destroy Russia and then China, which would lead to a global crisis and collapse; however, Moscow will never allow such a turn of events. He stated that over the past 30 years, Russia has been the target of a mediocre and primitive game waged by the United States. ""There is only one explanation - it is an enemy. What other successors of the USSR are there, even if there are no more fundamental ideological contradictions? This means that Russia must be humiliated, limited, divided and destroyed,"" underscored Medvedev. The next goal of Washington, Medvedev continued, will be the total weakening of China. Medvedev added that the Russian Federation would like to see the United States as a responsible state that performs all the functions of a great power, a state that tries to solve its many internal problems, and does not undermine the development of other countries. ""All this is possible. Unless, of course, you think that the US president's name is Volodymyr Zelensky and do not periodically ask aides how to spell Iraq or Iran correctly,"" he concluded. Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine on 24 February to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" the country after a direct request for assistance from the Donbass republics, which faced weeks of escalated shelling, sabotage and sniper attacks by the Ukrainian military. The Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics had earlier been formally recognised as independent states by Russia on 21 February.  In response, Washington and dozens of European nations have imposed several batches of sanctions against Russia, targeting its economy, space industry, financial institutions, businesses, etc. over what they called ""an invasion."" Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the goal of the current operation was to neutralise Ukraine's military capacity while not harming the civilian population of the country. In March, the Russian Ministry of Defence began presenting evidence of suspected Ukrainian plans to launch a full-scale offensive in the Donbass, and reporting on the presence of a network of Pentagon-funded biological laboratories in the country, the existence of which US officials and media first denied but later confirmed.

Biden had been in the Polish capital for talks with Kiev officials. Asked by reporters what he thought of Putin, he bluntly replied, “He’s a butcher.”Over the past few days, Biden has repeatedly launched vicious volleys at Russia’s president, ramping up his rhetoric each time. Last week, he branded Putin a “war criminal,” later referring to him as a “murderous dictator, a pure thug who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.”Moscow attacked its neighbor last month, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO alliance. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

This is a humanitarian issue."" It had also been reported the English top flights team Leicester City and Southampton had registered an interest in signing Shakhtar Donetsk winger Tete - though the league's reluctance to permit Moses' transfer would almost certainly see this deal falling apart for similar reasons.Several players and coaches have left their clubs in Russia since the beginning of Russia's military option last month. Yaroslav Rakitsky, the sole Ukrainian player on the Zenit St. Petersburg roster, had his contract canceled by mutual consent in early March.Former English Premier League boss Daniel Farke also left Russian Premier League team Krasnodar in March - just weeks after he joined the club and without managing a single game. Moses, 31, has made 42 appearances for Spartak Moscow across two seasons and was part of the Chelsea squad who won he 2016-17 Premier League title."
736eacfb-388f-4578-97b5-f90994ff3624,https://www.rt.com/news/552732-eu-gas-russia-alternative/,EU nations band together to buy gas,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.03/xxs/623e3690203027679348375a.jpg,European Union will look to replace Russian gas with more expensive American alternative,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters on Friday that the European Union will purchase gas on its own and divide it between members, a new development for the 27-member bloc.The move comes as European leaders seek to ditch Russian imports, and the US is waiting to ship its more costly product to the continent.“The energy mix and concrete situation in our members is very different but we need to work together to pool our weight,” Von der Leyen said at a press conference after a two-day summit in Brussels, Belgium. “We have an enormous purchasing power. Therefore, I welcome that we will now use our collective bargaining power. Instead of outbidding each other, driving prices up, we will pool our demand.”Von der Leyen has already promised to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian gas, but some EU countries remain dependent on a steady supply from Russia. Germany, whose leaders have recently warned that their economy could crash were Russian imports sanctioned, relies on Moscow for more than half of its gas supply.However, leaders in Berlin have balked at paying for Russian gas in rubles, as Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded they do earlier this week. France too has opposed the gas-for-rubles system, with French President Emmanuel Macron telling reporters on Friday that he believes such a demand is “forbidden” by law.Should the EU refuse to pay in rubles, as it likely will, its members will have to source their gas elsewhere. The US will likely step in to fill that void. In a joint news conference with US President Joe Biden on Friday, von der Leyen said that Washington would step up its deliveries of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to “at least 50 billion cubic meters” per year, which she said would replace a third of the gas currently provided by Russia.""We as Europeans want to diversify away from Russia towards suppliers that we trust, that are our friends, that are reliable,"" she said. However, American LNG is more expensive than the Russian alternative, and getting it to Europe involves condensing it to fill special tanker ships, before converting it back to gas upon arrival at a purpose-built port facility. There are currently two dozen LNG import terminals in Europe, but none in Germany, which is an important gas distribution location. At present, work has yet to begin on Germany’s flagship LNG terminal, which is set to start receiving gas in 2024.These issues with pricing and logistics led Germany to ignore American offers of LNG shipments under President Donald Trump, and press ahead with the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia instead. However, Nord Stream 2’s certification was halted in response to the conflict in Ukraine. ""I know eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe,” Biden said during his appearance with von der Leyen, before adding that high energy prices are something that Europe should put up with to oppose Putin.“It’s not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint,” he said. “It's gonna put us on a much stronger strategic footing.”"

Kiev has repeatedly accused Moscow of striking civilian targets, while Russia says it is only hitting sites used by the military.Major General Igor Konashenkov, a Defense Ministry spokesman, accused Kiev of trying to deceive the world with “cynical lies” about Russia’s offensive.He presented a set of images he said showed evidence of “nationalists” using a synagogue in the city of Uman, in central Ukraine, “for military purposes.” The city is a major pilgrimage site for Hasidic Jews.The spokesman added that the Ukrainians planned to use Jewish religious groups to exert pressure on Russia if the synagogue in question had been destroyed.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky mentioned the shelling of the city by Russia in his address to Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, on March 20. Tens of thousands of Jews gather in Uman to pay their respects at the tomb of a local religious leader.The images, according to Konashenkov, were dated March 21 and provided by “a member of Uman’s Jewish community.” They appear to be stills from a CCTV video and show a group of men in fatigues gathering around a truck and two buses parked outside a building, which Konashenkov identified as a synagogue.The truck is loaded with backpacks and objects similar to rolled up cushion foams. Two men cover them up with a bedsheet and a pair of blankets. The men in military-style clothes stand near a white bus with a warning sign on its windshield, which says “Children.”Another set of images, purportedly made at the same location, shows men in helmets and body armor outside a red bus. Some carry large bags and at least two men carry what resembles rifles.Konashenkov said the men belonged to “the two columns of nationalists that were formed on the territory of the synagogue.”The images do not show any of the men entering or leaving the building. Konashenkov, however, claimed that “weapons and ammunition, which were stored inside the synagogue, were first loaded by nationalists onto trucks and later disguised as bags full of construction waste.”Ukraine has so far not commented on the allegations, but Kiev has repeatedly accused Russian troops of destroying civilian buildings, including apartment complexes, hospitals and schools. Police and city officials reported that several missiles landed in Uman last month, killing one person.Moscow attacked the neighboring country in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the Donbass by force."

This includes countries that imposed severe economic sanctions against Russia over the conflict in Ukraine. Putin explained that illegitimate decisions by a number of Western nations to freeze Russia’s assets destroyed all confidence in their currencies.The EU is heavily reliant on Russian hydrocarbons. Around 90% of the gas used in the EU is imported, according to the European Commission. Russia provided roughly 45% of these imports at various levels to EU member states in 2021.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

However, according to IBA consultancy, most of the planes are still flying on Russia’s domestic routes.Dual registration of planes is forbidden under international rules but, in an unprecedented move so as not to lose the airfleet, Russia passed a law allowing it to move foreign-owned aircraft to its domestic registry earlier this week. Over 800 planes out of a total of 1,367 have already been registered, and they will be getting airworthiness certificates within Russia.According to the country’s authorities, the aircraft will stay and operate in Russia until the current lease contracts run out. The government will also be moving to buy these aircraft, worth an estimated total of $20 billion. The head of Russia’s Transport Ministry Vitaly Savelyev said this week that airlines are trying to negotiate with lessors to buy the planes, but “so far to no avail.” Meanwhile, 78 planes leased to Russian carriers were seized due to sanctions abroad, and will most likely be returned to lessors.However, the situation still leaves leasing firms hostage in the political battle. According to analysts, they face years of negotiations with insurers because of the unprecedented nature and scale of losses. Lessors could use security deposits or letters of credit from Russian banks to cover the losses, but the former are worth only a fraction of the planes’ value, while the latter are mostly in US dollars and effectively have no value because of Russian sanction-response currency controls. However, though the total value of the planes is large, the impact on individual leasing firms may not be too great, experts say, as Russian airlines mostly account for less than 10% of leasing firm portfolios.“It’s not going to cripple these businesses,” Brad Dailey, a director at Alton Aviation Consultancy, told Reuters, noting, however, that the situation “changes the future market potential of Russia.”For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

It has refused to respond to the rhetoric.“We do hear statements that are in fact personal insults to President Putin. These statements are actually coming from the president of the United States of America on a daily basis,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in response to a journalist’s question on Friday.“Considering such irritability from Mr. Biden, his fatigue, sometimes forgetfulness, which leads to aggressive statements, we will not give sharp assessments so as not to cause more aggression,” he concluded. Peskov added that being a thoughtful and wise leader, Vladimir Putin never responds to personal insults.On Thursday, speaking at the annual lunch dedicated to Ireland’s St. Patrick’s Day, President Biden referred to the Russian head of state as a “murderous dictator” and “a pure thug,” accusing him of waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine. Just a day earlier, the American leader called President Putin a “war criminal” in response to a journalist’s question.The escalation in rhetoric comes as Washington takes a firm stance condemning Russia’s military action in Ukraine. On Wednesday, following a video address to the US Congress by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Biden allocated an additional sum of $800 million in security assistance to Kiev. The money will allow the Ukrainians to buy hundreds of America’s so-called Switchblade kamikaze drones and Stinger anti-aircraft systems.The United States, together with its EU allies, is also continuing to impose sanctions on Moscow, targeting Russia’s banking and energy sectors, as well as the country’s top officials. Washington and Brussels, however, have refused Kiev’s demands to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, arguing it would lead to a full-scale Russia-NATO war.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

The victims sustained stab wounds to their hands and chest. ","The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has reported a sharp increase in crimes against people of Russian and Ukrainian origin in Germany since the start of Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine. The crimes ranged from mere insults and threats to actual violence. In addition, the BKA reported cases of property damage and drawing of graffiti with content targeting one of the groups. There have been numerous reports about instances of discrimination against Russians in Western countries as their governments whip up anti-Russian rhetoric over Moscow's decision to launch a special military operation to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. The operation was ordered as a response to a request for help from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR), which have been suffering from intensified shelling by Ukrainian forces.

Kiev has been pleading for foreign aid to help it fight off the Russian military offensive.“It is the responsibility of the West and especially the US to normalize relations with Turkey,” Altun wrote in a letter to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on Wednesday. He added that “what the West must do is deliver the F-35 fighter jets and Patriot batteries to Turkey without preconditions.”The spokesman wrote that Washington’s removal of Turkey from the F-35 program in 2019 was “unlawful.” The US refused to deliver the promised planes after Ankara rejected its demand to scrap the purchase of S-400s.Altun was responding to a Wall Street Journal op-ed from last week, which asked Ankara to give its S-400s to Kiev so they can use them to shoot down Russian aircraft. Paul Kolbe, a scholar at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and former CIA operative, wrote that Turkey could get the now-dead F-35 shipment from the US “back on track,” as well Patriot batteries as a “nice new American replacement” for the S-400s. Kolbe further argued it would be “symbolic” for Russian-made missiles to destroy Russian planes.Reuters reported on Monday that US officials informally pitched the idea of the transfer of the Russian-made missile systems to Ukraine during Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman’s trip to Turkey this month. Ankara and Washington have not commented on the matter.Turkey was in talks with the US to buy the Patriot systems before it acquired the S-400s, but the deal fell apart. Altun noted that, in 2015, Washington withdrew the missiles from the Turkish-Syrian border. Ankara’s relations with Moscow plummeted that year after a Turkish fighter jet shot down a Russian warplane during its mission in Syria.Turks still remember how our allies withdrew Patriot batteries from Turkey during some of the tensest periods in Turkish-Russian relations. In light of experience, the Turkish people no longer take seriously any informal pledge by the West to supply the Patriot.Altun pointed to Ukraine’s use of Turkish Bayraktar combat drones as part of a successful arms deal with the country. Kiev has been asking NATO to set up a no-fly zone over Ukraine or to supply it with warplanes in order to fend off Russian jets, but these requests have been denied.Moscow attacked Ukraine exactly one month ago, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev says the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

In order to facilitate the assistance, Washington has deployed a humanitarian response team consisting of 25 people, who will work in the region in close coordination with the United Nations, NGOs, and the government in Kiev.Additionally, Washington will invest over $320 million in ""democracy"" and ""human rights"" funding in Ukraine and neighboring countries, the White House outlined.“We remain committed to defending and strengthening democratic governance, human rights, and the fight against corruption in Ukraine and its neighbors, as together we reject autocracy and aggression,” the statement reads.The focus of the American Refugee Admissions Program will be those Ukrainians who already have relatives living in the United States. But to help those unable to move to the US, the Biden Administration said it will keep assisting Ukraine’s neighbors in Europe by partnering with governments and humanitarian organizations working on solving the refugee crisis.According to the UN, over 3.6 million people have fled Ukraine since the beginning of the armed conflict. Russia has taken in more than 270,000 refugees, while also providing humanitarian assistance to the regions affected by the war.Russia began its military offensive in Ukraine on February 24 following a seven-year-long standoff over the implementation of Minsk agreements and the Kremlin’s decision to recognize the independence of breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics and pledged to protect their sovereignty.Moscow claimed its military operation sought to achieve Ukraine’s full “demilitarization” and “denazification”. Kiev and Western countries have accused Russia of unprovoked premeditated aggression, hitting Moscow with unprecedented sanctions."

Wallace revealed that he terminated the conversation, which he described as a “dirty trick,” when he became suspicious over “misleading questions” and a request to shout some slogans.Today an attempt was made by an imposter claiming to be Ukrainian PM to speak with me. He posed several misleading questions and after becoming suspicious I terminated the call 1/2According to The Times, the imposter, who was posing with a Ukrainian flag behind him, asked Wallace about the chances of UK warships going to the Black Sea and whether Ukraine should get nuclear weapons or join NATO.The defense minister was not the only senior official who received hoax calls last week. Home Secretary Priti Patel also said that she had been targeted.Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries had apparently been chosen as a third victim but was lucky enough not to take the call.According to a Downing Street spokesperson, quoted by the British media, the hoax video calls last week were an attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to distract from military problems in Ukraine.“We are seeing a string of distraction stories and outright lies from the Kremlin, reflecting Putin’s desperation as he seeks to hide the scale of the conflict and Russia’s failings on the battlefield,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement.The spokesperson added that the calls were examples of the “standard practice for Russian information operations” and attempts “to distract from their illegal activities in Ukraine and the human rights abuses being committed there.”The statement from Downing Street apparently marks the first time the UK government has directly accused Moscow of orchestrating hoax calls.According to government sources referred to by the media, there are fears in Whitehall that “the Russians” may doctor footage of the conversations in a bid to embarrass the UK government.The Russian authorities have yet to comment on Downing Street’s accusations."

However, there are claims on social media that they were only trying to steal food, as they were starving after escaping from Kiev.Some social media users say the harsh punishment was due to the victims’ nationality. The atrocious act has been blamed on members of Territorial Defense Forces, a recently established volunteer branch of the Ukrainian military. Masked uniformed men are present in pictures from the site.Lviv, which is located in western Ukraine near the Polish border, has so far been mostly spared by the ongoing conflict in the country. In mid-March, Russia bombed a mercenary base at the Yavoriv range outside the city, saying that up to 180 foreigners who went to fight for Kiev were killed there. Ukraine put the death toll at 35.Reports of persecution of foreigners and minorities by radicals have also come from other parts of Ukraine since the Russian attack began in late February.There were incidents of African students being denied entrance to trains and buses carrying refugees out of country. Those who managed to reach the border with Poland were forbidden by border guards from standing in the same lines with Ukrainian nationals, called the N-word, and even beaten up. The African Union has decried these incidents as “shockingly racist and in breach of international law.”Indians studying in the country told Russian media about similar treatment. They also complained about being kicked out of bomb shelters, with locals telling them they wouldn’t help them because India isn’t helping Kiev in the conflict.Moscow sent troops into the neighboring country last month following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the breakaway Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Another goal of the military operation is to “denazify” the country, according to Moscow. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."

German energy giant E.ON, which operates the pipeline, has rejected the calls.TheGerman CEO has called for increasing investments in renewable energy sources and to “expand their use as quickly as possible.” Sewing also said that a technology-intensive nation such as Germany shouldn’t rule out nuclear energy in such a decisive way.Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank said it would shut down its business in Russia due to Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

He added that the US plans to consult its allies and partners before making any final decisions.In his speech, Sullivan also told reporters that further sanctions on Russia will be announced on Thursday, saying the announcement will focus “not just on adding new sanctions, but on ensuring that there is joint effort to crack down on… evasion, on sanctions busting, on any attempt by any country to help Russia basically undermine, weaken, or get around the sanctions.”Among the other topics to be discussed during the summit, Sullivan said the president will work on long-term adjustments to NATO’s force posture, and will announce joint action on ensuring European energy security and reducing dependence on Russian gas.According to the White House, Biden is scheduled to take part in the NATO summit and other meetings in Brussels on March 24. The following day, he will go to Warsaw for a meeting with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda to discuss the response to the “humanitarian and human rights crisis” created by the conflict in Ukraine."

The US claimed the Russians who were expelled had been “engaging in espionage activities that are adverse to our national security.”Moscow condemned the decision at the time, blaming Washington for a severe violation of commitments and calling on it to show “common sense” and to avoid further escalation. The Foreign Ministry said then that it would prefer not to expel American diplomats again but the “impudence” and “unwillingness or inability to negotiate” of the US might not leave any other choice.A week prior, the US also ordered the expulsion of the second highest ranking diplomat at the Russian embassy in Washington, Sergey Trepelkov. Late last year, the US ordered 27 Russian diplomats to leave. Previously, about 200 Russian diplomats worked in the US.On March 21, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that relations between Moscow and Washington were “on the brink of collapse.” Another harsh statement was made after US President Joe Biden, in response to Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine, called his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin a “war criminal,” a “murderous dictator,” and “a pure thug.”"

Still, Biden's comments have already made waves in the media, stealing headlines and prompting comments from across the world. The Kremlin was quick to note that it is not up to the American president to decide who should remain in power in Russia, with several of the country's lawmakers criticising Biden's recent rhetoric regarding his Russian counterpart. French President Emmanuel Macron also voiced criticism of Biden's harsh remarks. In the United States, many people, including lawmakers, were also dismayed by Biden's “horrendous gaffe.” This is not the first time that Biden has appeared to neglect diplomatic protocols and opt for harsh rhetoric instead.

This time the strike reportedly began at 9:00 local time (07:00 GMT). Several dozen people took part in the demonstration. At the same time, a caravan of 100 trucks has blocked traffic in the city of Cadiz in the southwest of the country, Europa Press reported. According to the news agency, the trucks have been honking and moving slowly along the main streets, except for the area next to the Puerta del Mar university hospital.

The strikes have been going on in Spain since 14 March, with protesters blocking roads and using violence against drivers not participating in the strike. The unrest was prompted by the difficult situation in the transport sector, poor working conditions, and an increases in gas and diesel prices, which accelerated after the start of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine. On Friday, the Spanish government agreed to compensate 20 euro cents per liter of gasoline and diesel to citizens. This involved the allocation of an additional 600 million euros ($670 million) from the state budget, which brought the total amount of assistance to the transport sector, together with previous measures, to over 1 billion euros.

While Washington initially tried to deny their existence, they later confirmed it, but claimed the labs’ activities were unremarkable.","The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) revealed new documents on Thursday that had been seized by Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, including correspondences between American financier Hunter Biden - the son of US President Joe Biden - and figures involved in biological research in Ukraine, which an investment firm of his helped to bankroll. The emails revealed the names of several American figures central to the biological research projects from the firms Metabiota and Black &amp; Veatch, as well as officials from the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Those named include: Pope was deputy director of operations, readiness and exercises at the DTRA from 2017 until 2020. He previously held various positions at US Air Force European Command (USAFE), US Central Command (USCC), and the Pentagon. Pope participated in the development of radiochemical procedures for monitoring international treaties in the field of nuclear weapons (Air Force Technical Application Center). The published emails revealed a correspondence between Pope and Ukraine’s acting health minister between 2016 and 2019, American-born Ulana Suprun, who went to Ukraine to participate in the US-backed coup in 2014. Williams took over for Pope as acting DTRA director in 2020, having previously been the agency’s director of development, test and evaluation. He led the Department of Defense’s program to develop capabilities to detect, locate and neutralize foreign WMD and improvised explosive devices. Williams also served as Assistant Deputy Administrator for Nonproliferation at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the US Department of Energy, the organization responsible for the country’s nuclear weapons arsenal. Wintrol headed DTRA projects in Ukraine until 2021 at the US Embassy in Kiev’s Defense Threat Reduction Office. Emails published by the MoD revealed she directly supervised experiments with deadly pathogens, including the UP-2 Project for “mapping highly infectious diseases in Ukraine,” including anthrax; the UP-4 Project, described as a “risk assessment of particularly dangerous pathogens transmitted by birds in Ukraine during migration”; the UP-8 Project studying “spread of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and hantaviruses in Ukraine and the potential need for differential diagnosis of patients with suspected leptospirosis. Previously released documents showed she also oversaw Project P-782, conducting research into the transmission of diseases through bats. Wintrol moved to Chemical Security and Elimination (CSE) in early 2021. According to a DTRA publication, CSE was formerly known as the Chemical Weapons Elimination (CWE) program and the Chemical Weapons Destruction (CWD) program. The effort “started in 1992 to build the capacity of the states of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) to reduce the threat from chemical weapons (CW) by securing and eliminating CW stockpiles, chemical research capabilities, and production facilities, while also redirecting scientists to peaceful purposes,” the agency said. Since 2013, Edwards has been the CEO of American engineering firm Black &amp; Veatch, a longtime contractor for the Pentagon used for a variety of construction tasks. He has been with the company since 1978 and was formerly its Chief Operating Officer. Black &amp; Veatch was long known to be working on Pentagon projects in Ukraine, but the documents seized by Russian forces earlier this month revealed the firm’s job in overseeing biological programs there, including the UP-8 project previously mentioned, studying Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, leptospirosis and hantaviruses. He has been the project manager in Ukraine for Black &amp; Veatch since 2011 and its biological project coordinator. In August 2021, he told the Kansas City Business Journal that his work on airborne biological agents in Ukraine had helped Black &amp; Veatch to develop a device for purifying air of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, the virus that causes COVID-19. Lippencott is a graduate of the US Army Military Academy at West Point. In one of the documents published by the MoD, a report from the Security Service of Ukraine’s Kherson region referred to “a potential threat to the epidemiological and epizootic situation in our country that has recently come to light as a result of DTRA’s intentions through Black &amp; Veatch to establish control over the functioning of Ukrainian microbiological laboratories that conduct research into particularly dangerous pathogens that can be used to create or upgrade new types of biological weapons.” Another document from Lippencott to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense concerns the extension of the UP-8 project mentioned above. ""Issues of biomonitoring and transfer of information were supervised by David Mustra, who is closely associated with another Pentagon contractor, Metabiota,” Konashenkov said. “Previously, he led military bio-projects in Ukraine and Eastern Europe as part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program.” Mustra was the company’s biosafety recruitment manager in Ukraine, its biosurveillance and control managers, and the head of Metabiota’s research and development. With a doctorate in microbiology from UMass Amherst, Guttieri was the Executive Vice President at Metabiota from 2014 until 2019, and was previously the vice president of its Science &amp; Technology Administration. She is now the lead scientist at Labyrinth Global Health. In Ukraine, Guttieri was the integrator of research projects for the US biology program and supervised the execution of biological projects related to the research of animals as vectors of disease. Madhav has been the CEO of Metabiota since 2019. She specializes in epidemiology and pandemics and has a PhD in Public Health. However, according to the Russian MoD, there was no information in the documents about her supervising any specific biological programs in Ukraine. Thorton was Metabiota’s senior microbiologist and laboratory start-up coordinator between 2006 and 2016. He previously spent 20 years in the US Navy, where he worked as a research microbiologist and head of the Navy’s Threat Assessment Department. According to his CV, Thornton did his work at secret facilities, including one in Cairo, Egypt, and “conducted research on disease agents of military relevance, especially enteric pathogens.” In Ukraine, Thornton advised local staff on highly dangerous pathogens as well as other epidemic disease related issues in DTRA projects, and coordinated the upgrade of reference laboratories in Ukraine to biosafety level 3 (BSL-3), which are used to study infectious agents or toxins that may be transmitted through the air and cause potentially lethal infections.

Under Joe Biden, the North Korean problem has been relegated to the back burner. A recent test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) allegedly capable of striking targets across the US demonstrates the folly of allowing diplomacy to languish.North Korea’s flight test of an indigenously manufactured ICBM on Thursday serves as a stark reminder that even as the international community wrestles with the consequences of Russia’s “special operation” in Ukraine, the world outside Europe remains a very dangerous place, with the potential for becoming even more so.The launch of the Hwasong-17 ICBM, which had been publicly unveiled at an October 2020 military parade in Pyongyang and again at a defense exhibition in October 2021, represents a dramatic leap forward in terms of North Korean military capability.The test, which used a mobile launcher from a site adjacent to Pyongyang International Airport, was conducted using a lofted trajectory that, according to North Korean media, saw the missile travel 1,090km (681 miles) for 67 minutes, reaching an altitude of around 6,250km (3,905 miles), before accurately hitting its intended target in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Japan. The flight parameters of the missile test would give the Hwasong-17 a demonstrated range of just under 15,000km (9,320 miles) – more than enough to hit any target in the continental United States.Reportedly, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, personally oversaw the launch of the Hwasong-17 – a missile he claimed had been developed due to “the inevitability of the long-standing confrontation with the US imperialists, accompanied by the danger of a nuclear war.” According to his nation’s state-run media, it is capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads, “exactly met the design requirements,” and was assessed as being ready for operations “under wartime environment and conditions.”Thursday’s test had been preceded by a series of missile launches that appeared to have been related to the testing of individual components in preparation for the full-scale testing of the missile. While these tests, which used the Hwasong-17 as a booster to launch military reconnaissance satellites, did not have the rocket fly to its full potential range, they did serve to validate its propulsion system, as well as its ability to separate a payload with precision in space – both essential tasks for an operational ICBM-capable missile.North Korea has been unable to achieve any meaningful diplomatic traction with the Biden administration, after four years of unprecedented yet ultimately fruitless direct engagement with the Trump administration and President Trump personally. As part of the now-stalled denuclearization talks, in 2018, North Korea undertook a self-imposed moratorium on the testing of long-range missiles.The ICBM test is a clear demonstration that Pyongyong believes the diplomatic window that had been opened with the US under Trump is now closed, and, as such, was in keeping with the goal of enhancing North Korea’s self-defense capabilities that Kim had outlined in his end-of-year message to the nation.The Biden administration has committed toa policy built around a notional “Pacific pivot” that would place the issue of North Korea and, in particular, its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, at the forefront. A disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, coupled with heightened tensions with Russia over Ukraine, have prevented this “pivot” from making the transition from paper to action, however.The important takeaway from the testing of the Hwasong-17 isn’t that North Korea is preparing for war, but rather that it is seeking to create an environment in which a diplomatic solution to the ongoing standoff with the West can once again take priority. Kim, in the aforementioned end-of-year speech, in December, did not emphasize military strength, but rather domestic frailty, acknowledging for the first time that his country was suffering acute food shortages. With devastating floods crippling North Korean rice production, the UN estimates the country is facing a food deficit of nearly 860,000 tons (780,179 tonnes), which can only be met with international assistance.The missile test, viewed in this context, is an important indicator of how Pyongyong seeks to move forward diplomatically in what has been a vacuum of US leadership. As such, it’s in keeping with its usual practice, which is to send diplomatic signals through demonstrations of military strength. However, these serve only to highlight the underlying insecurity of the reclusive nation, which remains at loggerheads with the US, South Korea, and Japan over the diplomatic path toward resolving decades of isolation and confrontation. If the only response by the US and the West to the testing of the Hwasong-17 is yet another round of economic sanctions, it may have no choice but to escalate its actions, most likely in the form of renewed nuclear weapons testing. The main problem today isn’t North Korean belligerency, but a lack of US vision in exploiting the opportunity created by Pyongyong’s measured provocation."
7bee875d-22aa-4c92-b698-271aa5dde5da,https://www.rt.com/news/552534-germany-gas-shortage-test/,German state agency reveals how gas shortage affects public life,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.03/xxs/623af93185f540159d2a2172.jpg,"The sudden drop in supplies will hit every crucial service, from hospitals to police","A 2018 stress test run by the German civil defense agency, the BBK, found that all crucial services will be impacted by a gas supply shortage. Newspaper Die Welt revisited the exercise on Tuesday amid calls for Berlin to stop purchasing energy from Russia as part of sanctions in response to Moscow's ongoing military campaign against Ukraine.The two-day crisis management exercise Lukex 18, which involved several states in southern Germany, found that the shortage of gas supply will have “a drastic effect on public life,” including the closure of public and private facilities.The disruption of supply will also lead to “far-reaching, difficult-to-predict consequences for the service sector and the production of goods,” according to the BBK.The BBK warned of personnel shortages because people will be unable to drop their children off at daycare centers, while hospitals and retirement homes may have trouble preparing meals.“Likewise, a high number of illnesses related to the cold are to be expected,” the agency said, adding that it will also lead to staff shortages in government departments, police, and civil protection services.The agency also said that during prolonged cold some people, especially those living in cities, might resort to keeping themselves warm by using fireplaces at home, or building makeshift fireplaces, which will lead to a spike in fires.In a video released on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, once again, asked Germany to stop buying energy from Russia. Some German politicians share the urgency. “I think it'll be tough, but doable, and that's why we should do it. But instead, the economy minister is spreading catastrophic scenarios,” Norbert Roettgen, an MP, told reporters last week.Berlin agreed to look for alternative suppliers and reached a deal to get liquefied natural gas from Qatar this week. However, the country has been hesitant to do away with Russian oil and gas just yet.Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned last week that Germany will see more unemployment and poverty if it immediately pulls the plug on Russian gas. “If we do not obtain more gas next winter and if deliveries from Russia were to be cut, then we would not have enough gas to heat all our houses and keep all our industry going,” Habeck said on Monday.Chancellor Olaf Scholz reiterated on Tuesday that sanctions were “the right approach,” emphasizing that they also must be “bearable in terms of the repercussions for the development of the national economy.”US President Joe Biden will meet European leaders in Brussels on Thursday, as the White House prepares to unveil new sanctions, Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, said. Washington banned imports of Russian energy this month, and has been long pressuring states like Germany to do the same.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked, denying claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

Moscow and Kiev have held three rounds of in-person talks and further contacts via video link, but the exchanges have failed to yield any tangible result apart from the two sides finding some common ground on humanitarian corridors and evacuation of civilians from combat zones.In mid-March, the Financial Times reported an imminent breakthrough in the talks, claiming that the two sides had drafted a 15-point peace plan. The report, however, was refuted by both Moscow and Kiev, while no actual breakthrough occurred. The new claims by the newspaper have not prompted any official reaction so far.The latest prediction appeared to directly contradict fresh statements by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who told Serbian media that both “denazification” and “demilitarization” remain among the main goals of Moscow.“It’s in our interest that these negotiations yield a result. A result that will meet our principal goals,” the top diplomat stated, adding that recent events in Ukraine have clearly shown that hard-line nationalist fighters “are exploring Nazi warfare style in practice.”“If you have seen how the Nazi Ukrainians from the Azov or Aidar battalions treat Russian prisoners of war now, I think everything becomes clear to you,” Lavrov said, referring to gruesome footage, purporting to show the torture and execution of Russian POWs by the Ukrainians that emerged over the weekend.Moscow launched a large-scale attack against  its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military alliance.

The row happened late last week, when Richard Grenell, the former acting director of national intelligence responded to a post by retired CIA officer John Sipher, who tweeted about ethical behaviour among public servants. He was referring to a letter signed by 51 former intelligence officials, including Sipher, and released after the New York Post (NYP) in October 2020 revealed the existence of what was purported to be Hunter Biden's laptop, which contained damning information on his business dealings in Ukraine that implicated his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden. As for Sipher, he was among the scores of signatories who then refused to apologise for their signing the letter after another US newspaper, The New York Times, ""authenticated"" the existence of the laptop, which was earlier described by the newspaper as ""Russian disinformation"". This was mentioned by Grenell after his Twitter showdown with Sipher entered its second day. ​In a subsequent post, Grenell wrote that while he was calling for sanctions on Nord Stream 2, Sipher was claiming Hunter Biden's laptop was Russian disinformation. ""You lied. There wasn't a single piece of intel that suggested it"", he added. Sipher responded by tweeting that ​”""there are no lies there"" and that ""the Russians clearly used the issue to damage our country [the US] but you and your ilk merely enabled and furthered Russian disinformation"". The ex-CIA officer argued that Grenell ""will support anything – even lies – to suck up to Trump"". Sipher cracked back posting that the remarks come from ""the man who failed to say a word when his boss said he trusted [Russian President Vladimir] Putin more than his own intelligence community"". Shortly thereafter, Grenell argued that Sipher ""can run but he can't hide​"", slamming the former CIA officer as ""a phony who lied about intel"". This was followed by the ex-Trump official posting a new tweet that included an image of Sipher blocking his tweets. ""Lol. He signed the letter saying Hunter's laptop was Russian disinformation​"", Grenell tweeted. The story originates with a bombshell New York Post article from October 2020, which exposed alleged corruption by the former vice president's son and apparent involvement of Joe Biden in Hunter's business deals. The laptop in question, containing a trove of potentially damning documents and described by then-President Donald Trump as ""the laptop from hell"", was reportedly abandoned by Hunter Biden at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. The younger Biden recently said that the laptop could have ""absolutely"" belonged to him, but added that he had never taken it to an IT store and claimed the device was perhaps stolen or hacked by Russian intelligence. In the October 2020 article, the NYP mentioned two alleged emails that Hunter Biden purportedly received from a top official at the Ukrainian company Burisma while he was on the board of the firm. In a May 2014 email, Burisma board adviser Vadym Pozharskyi purportedly asked Joe Biden's son to ""use [his] influence"" to politically support the Ukrainian company, while in another email, dated April 2015, Pozharskyi thanked the younger Biden for arranging a meeting with his father, then-US Vice President Joe Biden. POTUS has repeatedly denied that he had any knowledge about his son's work and financial gains. Former US Attorney General William Barr claimed after the release of the NYT's article about the authenticity of the laptop that Joe Biden ""lied to the American people"" during a presidential debate when he called the NYP's exposure of Hunter's emails ""a Russian plant"".

Until Wednesday, parallel imports had been prohibited in Russia and were punishable by a fine of up to $60,000.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

The Russian Ambassador earlier confirmed that he received a note from the Polish foreign ministry demanding the expulsion of 45 Russian diplomats over alleged espionage. Earlier in the day, the spokesman of the Russian diplomatic mission, Vladimir Aleksandrov, said that the Polish foreign ministry had summoned Andreyev. The Russian Ambassador to Warsaw slammed the decision as unfounded, noting that embassy employees were engaged in normal diplomatic and commercial activities. He added that diplomats on the list were to leave the country no later than in five days. Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Moscow would respond in kind to an expulsion of Russian diplomats from Poland. According to the website of the Russian Embassy in Warsaw, it employs slightly over 50 diplomats. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, weighing in on the reports on Wednesday, said Moscow will retaliate to Warsaw's decision. Earlier in the day, Stanislav Zharin, a spokesman for the Polish secret services' coordinating minister, said that Poland's Internal Security Agency had compiled a list of 45 Russian diplomats suspected of espionage, and demanded their expulsion. Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine after the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for help in defending themselves against continued attacks from Kiev forces. Moscow has reiterated that the aim of its special operation is to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine, with exclusively military infrastructure targeted. Russia added that it had no plans to occupy Ukraine. However, in response to what has been labelled “an invasion”, the US and its allies have been funneling military assistance to Ukraine, while slapping Moscow with massive sanctions. Thus, on Tuesday, Poland froze 140 million zloty ($33 million) of Russian assets as part of sanctions against Moscow, said government spokesman Piotr Muller. US President Joe Biden will be heading to Poland after the NATO summit scheduled to be held in Brussels on 24 March, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said earlier. According to the White House, the Brussels talks between NATO allies, G7 and EU leaders, will focus on ""international efforts to support Ukraine and impose severe and unprecedented costs on Russia"" over its ongoing operation in Ukraine.

These are states which have placed sanctions on Moscow in connection with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.The measure takes effect on Friday and requires that buyers open accounts in Russian banks to facilitate the payments. Putin first flagged the move, last week, explaining that the West's seizure of a large amount of his country's foreign currency reserves meant that receiving euro or dollars for supplies was counter-productive. “If unfriendly countries do not pay in rubles starting from April 1, we will consider this a default on gas contracts, in which case the existing contracts will be scrapped,” the president said. Putin explained that Russia ""supplied gas"" to Western states which ""paid us in euros, which they themselves froze.” “This means that  that we supplied the gas virtually free of charge,” he added. According to the Russian leader, his new decree represents a step towards the financial sovereignty of his country.The ‘unfriendly’ states Putin referred to are the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Switzerland, the 27 nations of the European Union, and a number of smaller countries.READ MORE: What happens if Russia turns off the gas taps to EuropeThe announcement instantly sent the ruble surging from historic lows against the US dollar and the euro, with the Russian currency recovering nearly all its losses since the military attack on Ukraine began over a month ago.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

The presence of US troops on its territory has been growing rapidly since August 2020, and the stance currently adopted by Polish authorities is much more dangerous for pan-European security than the mythical ""Russian threat"" that Warsaw constantly talks about. Authorities in Poland are also maliciously promoting a false version of their country's history of relations with Russia, depicting the latter as a hostile country, Medvedev wrote in his article for the Sputnik Polska. Poland hopes that its role in Europe might be significantly boosted at the expense of Kiev and vehemently declares its support for the latter, but the country's authorities are in a difficult situation. Costs of settling Ukrainian refugees, and in Poland their number is already approaching two million, are covered by the US, and Polish authorities are in no rush to invest their own funds, emphasized Dmitry Medvedev. According to the Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman, Polish authorities are willing to sacrifice the well-being of their country's citizens, their own economic interests as they succumb to a frantic Russophobic policy. One of the most painful issues for Poland is gas, underscored Medvedev, as he remarked that Polish citizens were constantly being warned that Russia is gearing up to wield its ""gas weapon"" against a state whose energy system is largely dependent on the purchase of blue fuel. He recalled that Poland has also taken a number of steps against the Nord Stream 2 project and to expand the presence of American companies in the EU gas industry, adding: ""Poland's dream is to become a European hub for the supply of liquefied natural gas from the United States. A terminal for receiving LNG in Swinoujscie has been built and is being expanded, it is planned to build a terminal near Gdansk, gas interconnectors with Lithuania and Slovakia, the Polish-Danish-Norwegian gas pipeline BalticPipe.” Medvedev noted that Poland considers the events in Ukraine, where Russia is conducting a special operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify the country, as an excellent reason to freeze any initiatives related to Russia, support ""the regime of anti-Russian sanctions and whipping up of a  new cold war."" Warsaw, said Medvedev, has been eyeing the territory of Ukraine, using anti-Russian rhetoric to mask its true intentions. Earlier, a partition map of Ukraine had been displayed on the air of the Polish TV channel TVP1, showing Lvov, Ivano-Frankovsk, Volyn, Rovno and Ternopol regions of Ukraine as part of Poland. Medvedev’s statements come as on Saturday, Russian Ambassador to Poland Sergei Andreev suggested Russia might be forced to temporarily close its embassy in Warsaw. The move is considered after Warsaw earlier announced it was expelling 45 Russian diplomats suspected of spying, in an allegation Andreev dismissed as ""nebulous."" Poland’s moves have followed in the footsteps of Washington and its NATO allies, which have been drumming up support for the Kiev authorities, pumping the country with weapons, while slapping Russia with sweeping sanctions over its actions in the neighboring country. On 24 February, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Kiev aggression. The Russian defence ministry said the operation is only targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure. Earlier in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decrees recognising the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. The new treaties oblige Moscow with ensuring the security of the two Russian-speaking republics. "

The change of heart came due to Europe's high reliance on these supplies, with Russia contributing to nearly one-third of the bloc's gas imports.","The Agriculture Minister for Baden-Württemberg, Germany, Peter Hauk, has suggested lowering the optimal room temperature for central heating to 15 degrees instead of a comfortable 20 as a measure that would purportedly allow Germany to say ""no"" to Russian gas immediately. Apparently, Hauk sees no issue with the residents of Baden-Württemberg ""freezing for freedom"" a bit and believes that it's worth depriving Russia, and specifically President Vladimir Putin, of money from gas sales. The minister proposed this measure as a response to the Russian special military operation in Ukraine. In Hauk's view, such a step from the German government, made at the expense of the comfort of its citizens, would ""make [anti-Russia] sanctions work"". What the Baden-Württemberg minister failed to mention in his estimates of the consequences of such step is the impact that abandoning Russian fossil fuels will have on the German economy in general. Fuel and energy prices (and as a result, the price of nearly all products) are bound to rise after Germany does away with Russian supplies, which constitute 55% and 35% of the country's gas and oil imports respectively. German Minister of Economy, Robert Habeck, recently warned that stopping the import of Russian energy resources will have the most drastic consequences for the country's economy. Russia, in turn, recently announced its response to the Western sanctions over the operation in Ukraine and said it will demand that payments for gas from ""unfriendly nations"" be made in rubles instead of dollars or euro. While the EU authorities rejected the idea, citing the existing contracts with Gazprom, it is unclear how they are going to enforce the payments in euro once Moscow implements the measure. "

The participants of the demonstration in Pisa held banners and shouted slogans ""Bridges of peace, not war from Tuscany,"" ""Italy, get out of NATO and war,"" and ""No War, No NATO."" In Rome, the protest was held near a military airfield. The demonstration was directed not only against the participation of Italy in the Ukrainian conflict, but also against the presence of military bases within the capital. Leftist and anti-fascist organizations also took part in the rally. In total, several hundred people took to the streets on Saturday. "

","Robina Qureshi, the head of the charity Positive Action in Housing, has lashed out at a UK government scheme aimed at helping Ukrainian refugees who are fleeing their country amid Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. She said that her charity had been dealing with 483 Ukrainian families, young people, and unaccompanied minors who needed a sponsor to house them, in line with the Homes for Ukraine scheme. According to Qureshi, the forms involved in this government programme are ""tortuous and confusing – with no guideline"". The Positive Action in Housing head asserted that Ukrainian refugees are turning to ""wholly unsafe methods"" of entering the UK, ""meeting people in Facebook groups, on social media"". Qureshi stated that the British government is ""responsible for giving people false hope and putting them further in the way of danger"". She spoke after Labour MP and Shadow Communities Secretary Lisa Nandy told The Observer that the government should do away with excessive bureaucracy and take more steps to coordinate the matching process so that the Homes for Ukraine scheme can work. This was preceded by The Telegraph reporting that the Homes for Ukraine scheme had descended into chaos as Britons launch bidding wars on social media boasting about their homes. According to the newspaper, users on Facebook are competing against each other, bragging about the size of their houses, bedrooms, as well as leisure facilities located nearby. Ukrainian refugees are said to have received 300 posts each with Brits offering them a place to stay in their houses. The Telegraph claimed that at least 147,000 people have registered for the Homes for Ukraine scheme, citing sources as saying that this amounted to more than 400,000 rooms. Under the Homes for Ukraine programme, residents of Britain have to offer accommodation for Ukrainian refuges for at least six months. The scheme stipulates that the government will provide ""a substantial level of funding to local authorities to enable them to provide much wider support to families to rebuild their lives and fully integrate into"" UK communities and people will have access to public services, work, and benefits. Authorities are offering an optional ""thank you"" payment of £350 ($460) per month to people who can accommodate one or more households, in sync with the programme. It is limited to one payment per residential address. The scheme was unveiled after the chiefs of the UK's MI5 and MI6 reportedly warned Home Secretary Priti Patel against easing visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees, purportedly due to the risk they could include Daesh* militants and mafia-linked criminals. The Daily Mail quoted unnamed senior intelligence sources as saying that ""no one disputes that this is a humanitarian tragedy, and that 99.9 percent of the refugees [from Ukraine] are genuine"". The sources, however, cautioned that the British government ""cannot just allow a complete open-door policy"", adding, ""Ukraine is a melting pot at the moment, and we have already been presented with fake passports"". UN estimates show that more than 3.2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian special military operation in the country on 24 February. Neighbouring Poland has so far received the most refugees, with others travelling to Hungary, Slovakia, Moldova, Romania, and the UK. Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine in order to demilitarise and de-Nazify the country, following a request for help from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, which saw weeks of intensifying shelling by the Ukrainian Army. The goal of the operation is to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure with high-precision weapons, which do not target civilians, according to the Russian Defence Ministry.

In it, Patel calls Russians “barbarians,” promises to step up spying on Russians in the UK, and is tricked into calling the pranksters “incredible heroes” and admits that her own country “plays dirty.”The duo – real names Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov – who call themselves ‘Vovan and Lexus’, set up a video call with Patel last week, in which one impersonated Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal. After releasing a teaser clip from the conversation on Thursday, in which Patel said that Britons were fine with Ukrainian “nationalists” settling in their country, the pair released the full 15-minute conversation on Friday.Patel opened by calling Interpol “feeble” for refusing to suspend Russia’s membership, saying that the UK and its Five Eyes (an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the US) colleagues would continue to push for Russia’s “blanket suspension” from the international policing organization. Britain would do this, she said, “because of the barbarians that the Russians are.”Patel and the fake Ukrainian PM talked about newly-passed British legislation allowing for the seizure of assets from Russian billionaires in the UK, and when the pranksters asked whether she’d support making this property available to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Patel replied that she “absolutely” agrees with the sentiment, saying “we want justice for Ukraine and justice for Ukrainians.”Patel then seemingly admitted to collaborating with Bellingcat, a supposedly “independent” investigative outlet which Russia has long accused of being operated by Western intelligence agencies. “Our approach is very clear in terms of the organizations we work with,” she said, adding that these organizations help her government “stand up for real facts.”The pranksters suggested that Patel could step up security checks on Russian students coming to the UK “in a special way,” by asking them to denounce Russian President Vladimir Putin or state their position on Crimea.“That’s absolutely right,” Patel replied. “We have some of the finest security checks, and working with our agencies that’s effectively the approach we are taking.”“We have some very very specialist work taking place on this right now, which clearly we can’t go into much detail on,” the home secretary continued.After asking Patel to say the nationalist slogan “Glory to Ukraine,” the pair then tricked her into saying a Russian phrase that roughly translates as “Britain plays it dirty,” before she gave a shout out to the pranksters themselves, whom she was told were Ukrainian war heroes.“Vovan and Lexus, incredible heroes, thanks to them for the work that they have been doing to fight for an independent Ukraine,” she stated.Patel is not the only British government official duped by the pair in recent days. In another teaser clip recorded last week and posted on Tuesday, the pair spoke to British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. Again posing as Shmygal, one of the two attempted to talk Wallace into helping Ukraine develop nuclear weapons. Wallace was enthusiastic, but did not give an official affirmation.Downing Street has accused Vovan and Lexus of working for the Russian state, calling their prank videos “standard practice for Russian information operations.” The pair have consistently denied working for the Kremlin, insisting their work is purely media in nature.  "

She added that “the American people absolutely deserve answers.” Stefanik referred to speculation that President Joe Biden could also have been involved in his son’s dealings, as the “big guy,” mentioned in the emails, was said to be his cover name. While legal experts stress that it might be challenging to prosecute Hunter Biden, as even if he did find himself before Congress, he would likely invoke the 5th amendment, Stefanik claimed that “the subpoenas will rain down if they do not turn over documents and answer our questions.” A “Senate report found that a firm linked to Hunter Biden got $3.5 million from a Russian billionaire who has yet to face US sanctions for Putin’s genocide in Ukraine. Why were they left off Joe Biden’s sanction list?” Stefanik asked. Last week, Republican Senators Ron Johnson and Rand Paul said they plan to investigate the Biden family if the GOP takes over Congress after the midterm elections. In addition, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., has written letters to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, chief of staff Ronald Klain, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, as well as multiple former US intelligence officials, and others, demanding that they preserve all Hunter Biden-related records. In October 2020, the New York Post published a series of materials based on correspondence allegedly found on Hunter Biden's laptop found in a Delaware repair shop. The owner of the workshop made a copy of the hard drive, which was given to Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and personal lawyer of then US President Donald Trump. The laptop was reportedly later seized by the FBI. The emails showed that Hunter Biden, employed by Ukrainian company Burisma between 2014 and 2019, organized a meeting with Joe Biden on behalf of the firm's management. Some of the documents, according to the reports, indicate the Bidens were abusing their authority to make beneficial deals with a wealthy Communist Party-linked Chinese tycoon. In an email in May 2017 from partner James Gilliar, it appears that Hunter was reportedly getting a 20 percent stake in the venture, with another 10 percent owned by the “big guy.” According to Hunter Biden's former business partner Tony Bobulinski, the “big guy” refers to Joe Biden, who, according to one of the emails, rejected the deal. Hunter Biden has, so far, denied all accusations and the US president has said he wasn’t aware of his son’s dealings. A month before the presidential race, all these reports were dubbed as a ""Russian disinformation” campaign, with some major outlets saying the leaked information did not prove the allegations and did not warrant a potential tax fraud and money laundering investigation. While the story received sporadic coverage in mass media, the two major social media platforms  took measures to limit it even more. Twitter and Facebook users were not allowed to post or share the New York Post story with other users, with Twitter even banning the newspaper's account in the crucial days leading up to the election. Meanwhile, around half of those who voted for the current US president did not know about the laptop story, according to a survey conducted by The Media Research Centre. The poll also showed that around 10 percent would have changed their vote if they had known about the leaked emails, which could have altered the outcome of the presidential election, which Biden won by a 4.4 percent margin over Trump. After The New York Times acknowledged the authenticity of the emails on March 17, some Republican lawmakers also called for US mainstream media outlets and Big Tech companies to be prosecuted for hushing up the laptop story.

He has been capped 12 times by Georgia, scoring an impressive five goals along the way.Russian football has seen an exodus of foreign players since military action was launched in Ukraine in late February.German manager Daniel Farke stepped down as boss of Krasnodar without taking charge of a single game, while Ukrainian defender Yaroslav Rakitskyi terminated his contract with Zenit St. Petersburg by mutual consent.Andriy Voronin also left his position as Dynamo Moscow assistant coach, while another German coach, Markus Gisdol, abandoned his job at Lokomotiv Moscow.Rubin Kazan did not comment to Match YV when asked about the claims that Kvaratskhelia could leave.   "

Following Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, some nations, led by the US, have pledged to stop buying Russian oil and gas. The United States, Europe, and others have been calling on Gulf Arab oil producers to ramp up production and help bring down crude prices, which at one point shot above $120 a barrel. The International Energy Agency announced earlier this month that it had decided to release 60 million barrels of oil from its emergency reserves, saying that global oil markets were already tight with highly volatile prices and commercial inventories at their lowest level since 2014.Many have expressed doubts, however, about whether it was possible to ditch Russia’s energy resources.Last week, the EU stepped back from imposing an embargo on Russian crude and petroleum products, despite pressure from the US. An immediate embargo on Russia’s fossil fuels “from one day to the next would mean plunging our country and the whole of Europe into a recession,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said last week. Europe gets nearly 30% of its crude and roughly 50% of its petroleum products from Russia.Reducing dependence on natural gas – something that the EU hopes to achieve over the next few years – may prove difficult as well. Qatar – which holds the third-largest natural gas reserves in the world – said last week that it was practically impossible to replace Russian gas on the European market, as between 30 and 40% of the total volume of gas supplied to the world market comes from Russia.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

The diplomats representing nearly two dozen missions, including EU countries along with Japan, Switzerland, Canada, the UK and Australia, “broke protocol by making the request” in a March 1 letter, he added.I haven’t bowed before anyone and will not let my nation bow either.Imran Khan faces a no-confidence vote this week, after he lost his parliamentary majority following multiple defections from his party. He scolded the opposition leader in the National Assembly directly, according to the Express Tribune, saying Shehbaz Sharif “polished boots when he saw a white man in a suit.”“I took an oath that I will not bow before anyone but God,” Khan reiterated, bringing up the US-led global war on terror as an example of a policy decision forced by the West that eventually brought Pakistan nothing but suffering. “We became part of America’s war against terror in Afghanistan and lost 80,000 people and $100 billion.”Pakistan has come under increased Western pressure to publicly denounce and distance itself from Moscow, after it abstained from a United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning Moscow's military actions against Kiev, choosing instead to remain neutral alongside 34 other countries, including China, South Africa and India.Despite being a vocal critic of the Indian government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Khan gave credit to the neighboring country for making “independent” decisions in the interests of its citizens.India is also facing international pressure and criticism for staying neutral and adopting a pragmatic approach to ensure the country's own energy security. New Delhi continues to buy Russian oil, available at discounted prices, as some countries have been avoiding it in fear of retaliatory sanctions from the US.Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “special military operation” in Ukraine on February 24, with a stated goal to “demilitarize and denazify” its government, ensuring that its NATO membership aspirations no longer pose a threat to either Russia or the newly recognized Donbass republics, which have suffered seven years of siege by Kiev forces.The US and its allies have accused Russia of starting an “unprovoked” invasion to occupy Ukraine. Moscow has seen thousands of harsh new curbs and sanctions slapped on it as a result, with the US, the EU, and others seeking to “isolate” and “destroy” the Russian economy."

At what price will the new package of sanctions come for the Europeans?","""The economic consequences for Europe are already dire, and they're just going to be worse. Unlike Russia, Europe is not self-sufficient when it comes to energy, nor when it comes to the production of food. So the price of food will climb and, in general, the living standard in Europe will fall,"" says Professor Stevan Gajic, a research associate at the Institute of European Studies in Belgrade. Reuters admitted on 22 March that European energy and commodity markets are currently ""in shock."" After the beginning of the Russian special operation to ""de-militarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine, launched under Article 51 of the UN Charter, the US and its NATO allies and partners imposed unprecedented sweeping sanctions on Russia. Since then, prices across gas, oil, metals and agricultural markets have leaped and have become very volatile, according to Reuters.  The UK and the US are also struggling with soaring energy costs, fuel bills and food prices. According to the Office for National Statistics, UK inflation has hit a 30-year high as British consumer prices rose 6.2% from February 2021. The US consumer price index has jumped 7.9% from a year earlier – a fresh 40-year-high – according to the Labor Department. Meanwhile, the price of natural gas in Europe exceeded $1,350 per 1,000 cubic meters on 23 March, following Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement that Russia will start selling gas to ""unfriendly countries"" in rubles. Both Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures remain well above $100 per barrel, seeing yet another hike on Wednesday on the news of the possible expansion of Russia energy embargo. Energy markets are now struggling to  tackle the potential loss of about 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from Russia given that any replacement oil is likely to be months away. If Europe were to go ahead and ban the import of Russian oil, coal, gas and other energy sources, then energy prices would rise substantially in Europe, warns Alexander Clackson, founder of Global Political Insight, a UK-based think tank. Even though this situation creates commercial opportunities for the US in the EU market, the problem is that neither the US nor other energy producers could immediately fill the gap left by Russia's oil and gas supplies, according to the observers. In addition to that, the US is incapable of quickly step up the production of LNG since the US gas industry has been traumatised by the economic pain it felt from 2014-2017 and the pandemic and is currently exercising ""capital discipline,"" according to the energy scholar. When it comes to crude, even though the US is likely to reach nearly 12.6 million barrels per day by 2023, and OPEC is likely to step up crude production in the future, it will take time, says Dargin. ""We are still expected to witness elevated oil prices due to the ban on Russian oil, which will have a negative impact on consumers,"" the energy scholar admits. European countries are aware of the potential consequences of the sanctions spree and remain divided over the imposition of the US-backed oil embargo on Russia, according to Alexander Clackson. Moreover, some countries in the EU are not in favour of any stringent sanctions against Russia, the scholar notes, referring to Hungary: Budapest is ""keen not to isolate Russia completely"". There is also the issue of trade: many Western companies that have pulled out from Russia are going to feel the negative effect from that, according to Clackson. Furthermore, the sanctions war against Russia is likely to backfire against the global economy: ""Global trade and the global economy will significantly decrease because of the sanctions war, which will obviously affect all countries, including the countries of Europe and the United States,"" warns the scholar. Nevertheless, it appears that the elites of major EU members Germany and France are ""too weak to stand"" against the US pressure and the ongoing media hysteria over Russia's Ukraine operation, according to Stevan Gajic.  The volatile economic situation has already resulted in popular protests in Spain. Roughly 150,000 farmers, ranchers and hunters marched through Madrid on 20 March to protest the Spanish government's failure to tackle soaring prices amplified by the EU sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine special op. There is the risk of growing civil unrest in Europe in the future, Gajic forecasts. According to Clackson, for the leadership of Europe and the United States ""the priority has always been to undermine Russia, to contain Russia and ensure that Russia's influence does not grow."" This policy is coming at a price for ordinary Europeans, he stresses, adding that ""while this process is ongoing, many ordinary people will suffer for the foreseeable future."" "

Recent reports have suggested that only a few issues are yet to be resolved between Iran and the P5+1 together with the European Union before Washington goes back to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a 2015 agreement which originally lifted some sanctions on Tehran in return for limits on its nuclear programme, but that was dropped unilaterally by Washington back in 2018. A total removal of Western sanctions from the Islamic Republic's businesses, banks, and officials is among the key issues which are yet to be solved. The other one is the exclusion of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces, from the US list of terror organisations. The IRGC has been subject to US sanctions since 2007, but it was only a decade later that the organisation was put on America's Global Terrorist List, becoming the first national military to be designated as such. Now that the US is reportedly considering removing the IRGC from that list, Washington's regional allies are biting their nails. In Israel, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid have already called on the White House ""not to abandon [its] closest allies in exchange for empty promises from terrorists"". In the Gulf, authorities have raised their eyebrows at the American dealings with Iran. ""The removal from the notorious list will make Iran even more radical. The US might not understand it now but this decision will eventually backfire"", he added. The Emirati official says he understands well the reasons pushing Americans to ""such a radical step"". Previously, Washington banned all energy products from Russia over its special military operation in Ukraine that kicked off on 24 February. The move sent energy prices in the US through the roof, and in an attempt to stabilise the market, the White House has approached Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to try to convince them to pump more oil. Those calls have fallen on deaf ears, and this is probably the reason why Washington is now counting on Tehran and its rich energy resources. ""We know what they are trying to do. They want us to pump more oil but we won't be dancing to their tunes"", the Emirati official said. Abu Dhabi has its own accounts to square with the Americans. They didn't appreciate the initial attempts of the Joe Biden administration to halt the supply of 50 F-35 jets and 18 Reaper drones. Nor did they like Washington's decision to get closer to Iran by resuming the negotiations around its nuclear programme. They did not agree with the White House's decision to remove Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have been staging attacks against Emirati targets, from the list of terror organisations. The Emirati official would not discuss the steps his country would take in the event Washington chooses to go ahead with the removal of the IRGC from the notorious list. But he signalled that Abu Dhabi is tired of being dictated to by the US and it might take matters into its own hands. Later in the day, the crown prince of the UAE, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, is expected to meet with Israel's prime minister and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah A-Sisi in Egypt. It is believed that the three will discuss the shaping nuclear deal and what measures the states can take to protect themselves. Will those talks evolve into something more concrete, like a NATO-style defence pact? It’s hard to tell. But now it seems clearer than ever that the UAE no longer believes the US has a shoulder they can lean on. "

","The BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) will be at the heart of a new world order, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said.  ""In all respects ... these countries will become the basis of a new world order,"" the deputy foreign minister told RT when asked whether the BRICS countries would take a more important role in the world.Russia is working to establish contacts with any country that is interested in cooperation, he said. ""There is no news here about our stable and long-standing policy of establishing a comprehensive static partnership with China, this is just another step,"" he said, commenting on the recent meeting of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi. Commenting on President Putin's decision to switch to ruble payments for gas contracts with 'unfriendly' countries, Ryabkov said that Russia is not changing the terms of the contracts but is protecting its interests. The fact that countries in the West quit contracts with Russia in several spheres ""just within a night"" is shameful, Ryabkov said. Russia has always been a reliable supplier and intends to continue gas deliveries to Europe; however, the interests of Moscow should be taken into consideration as well, he added. The diplomat hopes that European countries will revise their decision not to pay for gas in rubles and will find a creative approach to the issue.  According to the diplomat, Russia will draw its own conclusions from the racist Russophobia that has been unfolding in the West recently. These anti-Russian sentiments are not related to the situation in Ukraine, the West simply hates Russia, Ryabkov said.  ""...They do not believe that there is place for Russia's independent policy and Russia's independent position on global political arena which we are going to protect,"" the official added.  "

However, the leadership in both countries has been more reserved.","Governor of the Bank of Finland Olli Rehn has called for Finland to join NATO using an arrangement similar to that of its northern neighbour. Rehn, a former European commissioner, has been a staunch supporter of NATO for decades. He first called for Finland to join NATO in a 1994 opinion piece, when he was a lecturer in political science at the University of Helsinki and a Centre Party MP. Remarkably, in the very same opinion piece he called Ukraine a ""powder keg"". Rehn furthermore suggested that the EU should phase out energy imports in order to limit Russia's foreign income in light of the Ukrainian conflict, in which Russia intervened to protect the inhabitants of the newly-recognised Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk from intensifying attacks by Ukrainian forces. While Russia's stated goal is to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine, the West portrays the special operation as ""invasion"" and has introduced several rounds of crippling sanctions targeting all spheres of life from tech to consumer goods. The Bank of Finland governor noted that EU energy imports from Russia this year are projected to be worth some 600 billion euros at current prices, three times higher than in 2020. Stopping Russian energy exports has been on the European agenda since the start of the operation. Last week, Finnish Finance Minister Annika Saarikko proclaimed that Finland must work to end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Earlier in March, Prime Minister Sanna Marin also said Helsinki intends to drop its energy dependence on Russia ""as soon as possible"", citing a ""shift in views"" across Europe following Russia's special operation in Ukraine. In a pivotal point, Germany decided to suspend the key Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which has been seen as an important tool for guaranteeing Europe's energy security. Finland, for its part, has frozen plans to build a nuclear power plant in partnership with Russia's Rosatom. The NATO debate in traditionally non-aligned Finland has flared up anew since Russia's special operation is Ukraine began. Over recent weeks, two groundbreaking opinion polls emerged, in which around 60 percent of Finns voted in favour of joining the alliance, for the first time in history. Yet, the country's elite has been markedly more cautious. President Sauli Niinistö said it was ""clear"" that possible Finnish membership in NATO would permanently increase tensions with Russia along the two countries' 1,300-kilometre-long border. While calling a ""preventive effect"" the greatest benefit of NATO membership, Niinistö ventured it would entail various types of Russian retaliation. A similar dynamic has manifested itself in neighbouring Sweden, a fellow non-aligned nation, with recent opinion polls indicating a first-time majority in favour of joining the alliance. The nation's ruling class, however, is considerably more reticent. Let's stay in touch no matter what! Follow our Telegram channel to get all the latest news: https://t.me/sputniknewsus "

Scott Ritter, former UN Weapons Inspector and WMD Whistleblower, has sat down with Sputnik to discuss the special operation.","Sputnik: Speaking to Maverick Multimedia on 19 March, you said that Russia’s special operation in Ukraine is ""close to being over"" in Russia's favour and that Moscow's military op will later be studied by specialists. What's so special about Russia's operation, in your opinion? Scott Ritter: I think the thing that separates the Russian special operation in Ukraine, apart from other military operations of this nature, is the fact that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine. This is something that the Russian leadership has said from the very start. A military operation that is designed to occupy is a much more complicated operation requiring significantly more troops. It is about holding cities, holding roads, holding specific geographical areas.  This kind of focus allows Russia to avoid the trap of being compelled to carry out operations to conquer territory, instead, to focus on a more specific task of eliminating military formations with the goal of eventually leaving Ukraine. Sputnik: Why are the Western mainstream media continuing to claim that Russia's Ukraine operation has stalled? Does it mean that they do not understand Russia's strategy and objectives? Or does this narrative serve some other purposes? Scott Ritter: I think there are two reasons why the West is mischaracterising the Russian military operation in Ukraine. First is that the West is evaluating this as if it were Russia's intent to occupy Ukraine. From the very start, the fact that Russia is coming in with only 200,000 troops makes no military sense when we are speaking of a nation of 40 million people with a combined military capability of around 600,000 troops.  The other aspect of the mischaracterisation is that there is an information warfare aspect to this war. The West is hopeful that they will be able to use the Russian operation in Ukraine as a vehicle to motivate domestic political unrest in Russia that will at a minimum compel the Russian leadership to withdraw from Ukraine with its mission unfinished, and at a maximum lead to the overthrow, the removal of the Russian president and the Russian government, sort of a colour revolution, if you'd like to say so.  In order to do this, they are creating a picture of a military disaster in Ukraine on the part of the Russian military, and they're trying to project this narrative of a military disaster back into Russia in an effort to demoralise the Russian population and provide the impetus for massive popular demonstrations against the Russian government. Sputnik: Western pundits, politicians and experts are speculating about Russia's ""possible chemical attack"" in Ukraine. They have not presented evidence that Russia possesses such weapons, nor provided any proof that such plans exist. What could be the primary purpose of this narrative? Scott Ritter: The current narrative being put out by Western leaders and the Western media about the Russians preparing a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine is born of the standard reaction when one side is caught doing something that they shouldn't have been doing and they seek to project blame onto the other side. There is no doubt in my mind that the Russians are not preparing a chemical weapons attack. This makes no sense from both a military and political standpoint. Plus, it presumes the existence of a military-scale chemical warfare capability in Russia that Russia simply doesn't possess. But what has happened is that Russia has discovered biological research facilities inside Ukraine, operated by the United States Department of Defense, and they've discovered certain research activities which are difficult to explain by the United States that could have offensive biological warfare capacity. And the United States is embarrassed by this.  So, it's deflecting the narrative back on to Russia. And in doing so, they expand the narrative based upon past allegations that Russia supported chemical weapons used by the Syrian government in Syria, that Russia used chemical agents against the Skripal family in the United Kingdom. That Russia used chemical agents against the political dissident Navalny in Russia. And therefore, because Russia is ""guilty"" of all three of these things, Russia is preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine. It's an absurdity. It's ridiculous, but it's part and parcel of the ongoing information warfare campaign being waged by the West against Russia. Sputnik: NATO has been increasing its military presence along its eastern borders since the beginning of the Russian special operation in Ukraine. What's behind this military build-up, in your opinion? Scott Ritter: The ongoing NATO build-up on its eastern flank, I believe, is an exercise in confidence-building on the part of NATO. We are talking about an organisation that has just gone through, in this past summer, a terribly demoralising withdrawal from Afghanistan. One that made it question its relationship with the premiere power in NATO, the United States. And question the ongoing viability of NATO as a military alliance. I mean what is the purpose of NATO? The Russian incursion into Ukraine has breathed new life into those who believe that there is an ongoing purpose to NATO. But it is one thing to say NATO is relevant, it is another thing to make NATO relevant. And one of the things we know about NATO in the past decade or so is that it is militarily impotent. It doesn't have viable military capacity. There are ongoing discussions in Brussels right now in the emergency summit that NATO has convened about the possibility of putting NATO's peacekeeping forces into western Ukraine. You know, this is insanity. Under any circumstances, NATO does not have the ability to do this and prevail. But again, they've assembled these forces, they're looking in the mirror, they think they like what they see and they think that there's real muscle there. And, who knows, they may be compelled to believe that they have more capability than they really do and try to project these forces in the west of Ukraine, in which case there will be, unfortunately, a military clash between NATO and Russia. Sputnik: What are the odds of NATO troops getting involved in the Ukraine conflict? Scott Ritter: If someone had asked me at the beginning of the Russian incursion into Ukraine what are the odds of NATO getting involved? I would say zero because NATO had made it clear that it was not going to get involved in any fight between Ukraine and Russia on Ukrainian territory. But as this conflict goes on, as millions and millions of Ukrainians seek refuge in NATO countries, we're now looking at an economic and humanitarian catastrophe for NATO. And there are now people talking about not just imposing a no-fly zone, but actually putting NATO peacekeepers on the ground in western Ukraine. I don't think NATO is going to make the decision today to send peacekeepers in, but I do think this issue is being discussed and will be tabled for consideration at a later date. And that later date could come sooner rather than later if more and more refugees appear at the border between Ukraine and NATO nations like Romania, Hungary, and Poland. "

Here’s how it will work,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.03/xxs/623325e12030277e0308d382.jpg,Beijing is the only major power to benefit from Moscow’s conflict with Kiev,"First published in Russian on globalaffairs.ruRussia’s military operation in Ukraine and the consequent economic embargo of Moscow by the West is the largest upheaval in world politics since at least the end of the Cold War. The result will be a complete reformatting of the country’s foreign economic relations and its economic model, as well as Russia and the US sinking into a protracted military-political confrontation in Eastern Europe.Both factors will have a direct impact on the situation in East Asia amidst a gradually growing confrontation between China and Washington there. As a result of standing on the sidelines of the crisis and calling on the parties to show restraint, Beijing will be the only world center of power to benefit from the Ukrainian catastrophe in the long run. It is possible that the events in Ukraine will predestine China’s success in opposing the United States.The Chinese position on the Ukrainian crisis was expressed to the fullest in a telephone conversation between its Foreign Minister Wang Yi and a number of his European colleagues. In brief, it boils down to five points:China has expressed its regret over the ongoing tragedy, and welcomes any negotiations leading to peace. This is the rhetoric traditionally heard from Beijing regarding conflicts and crises in which it is not involved. The Xi Jiping government has avoided condemning Russia, while leveling veiled criticism at the West for NATO expansion and its unwillingness to listen to Moscow’s security concerns.Chinese officials are not calling Russia’s actions in Ukraine an ‘invasion’. Its state media does not publish materials that present Moscow and its president in a negative light. In the Chinese blogosphere, Vladimir Putin, as well as his actions and rhetoric connected with the Ukrainian operation, are met with wide approval by nationalist-minded people who draw parallels between this situation and China’s relationship with Taiwan.Despite widespread speculation that Beijing, as Russia’s only remaining friendly major trading partner, could put pressure on Moscow to conclude a peace agreement as soon as possible, there is no indication that Beijing has even considered doing so.China has taken a position of neutrality that is friendly to Russia concerning the conflict. Representatives of the country’s Foreign Ministry and the Chinese banking regulator have repeatedly stressed their intention to fully maintain relations with Russia despite the situation.During the UN Security Council vote on the Ukrainian crisis China abstained, electing not to support the Russian veto. But it did the same during the Crimean crisis. In principle, China cannot recognize precedents that support changing the status of territories based on referendums (as happened in the Crimea, Lugansk and Donetsk Republics) since this will affect the Taiwan problem. It should also be noted that Russia does not recognize and does not support the Chinese position in its territorial dispute with India, or Chinese claims in the South China and East China Seas.American statements about having ‘discussions’ with China about the situation surrounding Ukraine and even of China giving some consideration to Westent sanctions are divorced from reality. This is not the first time this situation has occurred. In 2014, President Barack Obama tried to convince the Chinese not to conclude an agreement with Russia on the construction of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline, which was nonetheless signed in May of the same year.As in the previous stages of the Ukrainian crisis, Chinese companies and banks operating on the world market should take into account the possible negative impact of US and EU sanctions. In this respect, they do not differ from the businesses of any other country. However, the Chinese typically exhibit an acute fear of falling under punitive American measures, which leads them to a wide interpretation of sanctions.Therefore, regardless of the position of the Chinese government, sanctions have always had a certain negative impact on Russian-Chinese cooperation. In addition, the shock effect from the disruption of usual payment mechanisms, production chains, and logistics in the coming months will inevitably manifest itself. Businesses will have to find new ways of operating.At the same time, the parties have so far carried out significant work to put a secure infrastructure in place to ensure bilateral trade, and such efforts have continued until very recently. In 2020, the share of the ruble in bilateral trade reached 7 percent, and the yuan – 17 percent. China is striving to internationalize its currency, and it can now be used for settlements between non-residents of the country.Preparing for a tough conflict with the West, Russia has sharply increased the share of yuan in its gold and foreign exchange reserves. According to some estimates, the Bank of Russia has $140 billion worth of Chinese government bonds denominated in yuan alone. Indirectly, this may also indicate that the current volume of sanctions has been expected for a long time.In addition, China’s CFETS trading system and the Moscow Exchange have been trading in the yuan-ruble currency pair since 2010. Thus, conditions exist for all trade between the two countries to be shifted to national currencies, mainly to the yuan, due to the volatility of the ruble.In 2020 and 2021, China’s share of Russian trade was about 18 percent. Beijing is Moscow’s largest nation state trading partner, although the EU as a whole takes a bigger share. It was about 38 percent in 2020. Since 1999, the China’s share has been steadily rising, while the EU’s has been gradually falling since the second half of the 2000s.If this trend were to continue, one would expect the levels of the China and the EU in Russian trade to be roughly equal in the early-mid 2030s. However, with the EU’s embargo of Russian imports, the process of reorienting to China may slightly accelerate, and China could become Russia’s main trading partner within the next two or three years. As a result, the trade between Russia and its main trading partner will be safe from external influences.A sharp increase in Russian raw material exports to China may be constrained by lack of appropriate infrastructure, including the capacity of railways, pipelines, and port terminals. China exports mainly finished goods, which are less dependent on transport capacity.Consequently, in the next free years, we should expect a sharp increase in Chinese exports to Russia with a more modest increase in Russian exports to China. There may be a significant imbalance in favor of Beijing in Russian-Chinese trade for some time.In this context, the early accumulation of huge yuan reserves indicates that Russia’s authorities have been preparing for something resembling the current configuration of economic sanctions.Beijing’s promotion to the role of the sole or main buyer of some types of Russian products and trade in exchange for yuan is likely to mean some price losses for Russian exporters. But, under the current difficult conditions, this can hardly be considered critical. With the development of new logistics, China may eventually replace the European market.The importance of redirecting exports to China means development of the requisite infrastructure in the Far East will need to be accelerated. Given the importance of speed, it will probably have to be built with the involvement of Chinese investment and companies. Construction projects like this can give important impetus to development in the Russian regions.The issue of expediting the conclusion of contracts for this construction will also arise, as well as the question of completing the Soyuz Vostok gas pipeline (a continuation of the Power of Siberia – 2), which taps into the same raw material base as the pipelines to Western Europe, ahead of schedule.China may have significant interest in redirecting Russian raw material exports to itself while converting it to yuan, as this will not only give Beijing numerous political and strategic benefits, but also bring it huge economic gains. In particular, China’s protection from sanctions and embargo attempts will sharply increase, the cost of acquired resources will decrease, while the role of the yuan in world trade will dramatically rise (the internationalization of the yuan is an important goal for Chinese policy).Russia’s earlier attempts to diversify its economic ties with Asia can be considered dead after the region’s three most developed economies (Japan, South Korea, and Singapore) supported anti-Russian sanctions to varying degrees, albeit under severe pressure from the United States.China will inevitably become the dominant partner, and it is possible that, in the near future, its share in Russian trade will be comparable to the peak values of the EU’s share at one time (more than 50 percent).A positive point for Russia is the growth in the number of Chinese companies that have fallen under various kinds of American sanctions which occupy strong positions in mechanical engineering, information and communication technologies, and the aerospace industry. This increase in pressure from US sanctions began in 2020, and there is reason to expect that this will only grow. Sanctioned Chinese companies will not need to fear the costs of working with Russia.Chinese partners, including those under sanctions, are capable of occupying places in many important segments of the Russian market formerly held by European and American companies. This is, first of all, in the sale and production of cars, consumer electronics, and industrial equipment in Russia. In many areas, the Chinese are quite capable of replacing Western suppliers – sometimes with a moderate loss of quality, and sometimes without.An important area where the Chinese cannot be useful to us as of yet, where they are experiencing problems similar to ours, is the aviation industry. China, like Russia, depends on imported equipment. As in Russia, its own civil aviation programs (ARJ21, C919) are dependent on Western components and vulnerable to sanctions pressure that is already being exerted. Strengthening cooperation in replacing Western civil aircraft is an urgent issue.In order to somehow curb economic dependence on China, Russia will have to use the few tools at its disposal to diversify foreign trade. Nevertheless, it is obvious that, while it is facing an economic blockade by the West, Russia will have no choice but to increasingly expand political and military cooperation with Beijing.The importance for China of Russia’s resource, technological, economic, and military potential amidst confrontation with the United States will allow Russia to avoid sinking into a clearly subordinate position in this partnership. But China will set the tone, nonetheless.The real political goal will be to preserve the ability to restore Russia’s ‘strategic autonomy’ with a possible weakening of the embargo in the long term.Moscow has not been involved in many disputes between Asian powers, and its policy towards Asia has been independent from China’s, except for that of generally containing the influence of the United States. Now Russia will have to protect its ties with independent players, in particular with India and Vietnam, while sacrificing its relations with US allies in the Indo-Pacific region, primarily Japan and Australia, for the sake of strengthening its partnership with China.The negative trend that has recently emerged in Russian-Japanese relations will sharply intensify. Events like the joint patrol of Russian and Chinese fleets around Japan that took place at the end of 2021 will continue. There may be a question of coordinating the two countries’ positions in territorial disputes with Tokyo (Chinese claims to the Diaoyu /Senkaku Islands and the problem of Russia’s southern Kuril Islands).As it moves to more actively promote its global initiatives and concepts of world order (Community of Common Destiny, relations between great powers in a new era, the Belt and Road initiative), China may be interested in attracting proactive support from major countries, and it is likely to receive such backing from Russia. Actually, this was already manifested in a joint Russian-Chinese declaration following Vladimir Putin’s visit to China on February 4, 2022.China probably can’t radically ease the shock of the first months or year of the embargo for Russia – everything will depend on Russian economic policy here. In the long term, Russia’s partnership with China, along with its own industrial policy, will become the basis of a new model for Russian economic development. And, in some respects, a healthier foundation than its previous partnership with the EU. China is less attractive to the elite as a place to extract capital and then permanently relocate, and it has a more rational and predictable system for economic decision-making. Finally, the Chinese economy will grow faster than Europe’s in the foreseeable future, as well as its market demand.China will replace the EU as our main trading partner, and a gradual reversal of trade flows to the East may become a factor in the development of Siberia and the Far East, right down to the relocation of part of the population there from the European part of the country. The negative impact of Western sanctions on Russian-Chinese cooperation will gradually weaken as China itself is drawn into the sanctions confrontation with the West. Another important factor in this will be trading in yuan.With a rational policy, Russia can come out of the Western embargo significantly strengthened, with more diversified foreign trade and better developed export infrastructure in the Far East, as well as more balanced foreign relations that are more resistant to sanctions.The price for this will be the undermining of the policy Moscow had been pursuing for many years to diversify its ties with Asia. Russia will be forced to act in line with China’s Asian policy not only to contain the United States, but also to confront US allies led by Japan. The negative impact of its partnership with China on relations with India and Vietnam can be minimized as long as these countries remain independent players, not unduly beholden to the United States, and, thus, do not become priority targets for Chinese pressure.The question of forming a military alliance with Beijing will most likely not arise in the near future. But hypothetically, it is still impossible to exclude the emergence of a formal Russian-Chinese military alliance, or situational military interaction in the event of military crises in the Pacific. Or, for example, appeals to article 9 of the Russian-Chinese Treaty on Good Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation of 2001. This article stipulates that, in the case of a threat to one of the parties, urgent consultations are to be held to eliminate such a threat. This is quite a realistic prospect in the event of a crisis concerning Taiwan, when Beijing will be interested in Russia’s ‘nuclear umbrella’ to prevent American intervention."

Trump was notoriously critical of NATO and the G-7 during his campaign and time as president. He also reversed former US President Barack Obama’s signature foreign policy accomplishment - the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which was designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting strict sanctions. The comment brings to mind the “pied piper” strategy employed by the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign, later revealed by Wikileaks. In an email from Clinton staffers to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) the campaign called for a “pied piper” strategy designed to elevate more extreme candidates, forcing the moderate candidates in the field to take far-right positions. The idea was to make the Republican party as a whole look extremist, causing independent and moderate voters to turn away. “We need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and tell the press to [take] them seriously,” the document attached to the email stated. Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and Ben Carson were listed as potential “pied piper” candidates. Unfortunately for Clinton, Trump ended up winning the primary and eventually the presidency, all while introducing his fringe views to the mainstream. Some might say Biden should take note. Biden likely won’t have to employ such a strategy again if he truly wants to face Trump in 2024. A recent Morning Consult poll found that Trump holds a commanding lead in a potential GOP primary race. Some 47% of Republicans who responded to that poll said Trump would be their preferred choice. Trump has hinted at a potential 2024 run, but has stated that he would wait until after the 2022 midterm elections before making a decision. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

This was Walid Taha from the Ra’am (United Arab List) party, which is part of Israel’s ruling coalition. Ra’am leader Mansour Abbas snubbed the event as he was addressing a conference in the city of Haifa at the time.The opposition Joint List, which unites four Arab parties and holds six seats in the parliament, boycotted the Ukrainian president’s speech altogether.The move was announced beforehand by the left Hadash party, which leads the alliance. Its only Jewish member, Ofer Kassif, explained on Saturday that “unlike the claims we hear in the Western media, and also hear day and night, that this war is like war of the Sons of Light against the Sons of Darkness... but it isn’t.”“For years, there were crimes against the Russian minority in Ukraine,” Kassif said, apparently referring to up to 14,000 people killed in Kiev’s attacks on the breakaway republics in Donbass since 2014 and the clampdown on the use of the Russian language by the Ukrainian authorities.“In Ukraine, the regime shamelessly works hand in hand with neo-Nazi militias such as Azov. This is the truth. There is no Sons of Light against the Sons of Darkness here,” the lawmaker pointed out.However, Kassif said he was still against the Russian military operation in Ukraine and urged Moscow to swiftly withdraw its forces from the neighboring country.“Our position is that NATO and its leader America imposed this war,” a spokesman for the Joint List and HadAsh chief Mansour Dahamsheh told the Times of Israel on Sunday.One of Moscow’s demands during the ongoing peace talks with Kiev is for Ukraine to declare itself a neutral country, so it cannot become part of NATO’s eastward expansion, which Russia sees as a major threat to its national security.During his speech, Zelensky, who is Jewish, shamed Israel for not doing enough to help Kiev during the conflict and for refraining from sanctioning Russia. He insisted that the Jewish state should send air defense systems and other weaponry, while also comparing the events in Ukraine to the Holocaust.The latter point angered many Jewish parliamentarians, who accused the Ukrainian leader of distorting history and attempting “to erase the involvement of the Ukrainian people in the extermination of Jews.” The statement by Zelensky “borders on Holocaust denial,” Yuval Steinitz of the Likud party insisted.The Israeli government was less emotional, with Foreign Minister Yair Lapid thanking Zelensky for “sharing his feelings and the distress of the Ukrainian people” with the Knesset. “We will continue to provide assistance to the Ukrainian people in any way that we can,” he stated.Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked, denying claims it was planning to retake the Donbass republics by force.Since the Russian offensive began, the US, along with its international partners, imposed a slew of unprecedented sanctions against Moscow."

The Committee cannot extend the Nobel Peace Prize nominations deadline, which is January 31,” the director said, in response to RIA Novosti’s inquiry.He added that the members of the Committee retain the right to put forward their own nominations until its first formal meeting. This has already taken place, on February 28.A total of 36 former and incumbent EU officials, including parliamentarians and ministers, had signed an open letter requesting the Nobel Committee to extend its deadline for the peace-prize nomination until the end of March to facilitate the Zelensky proposal.The initiative, pioneered by predominantly Dutch politicians, calls on the ""global community"" to support “brave Ukrainian men and women” in the face of “this war waged upon them by the Russian Federation.” According to the Eurocrats, the Ukrainians are “fighting to preserve democracy and self-government” by “resisting the forces of authoritarianism.”Currently, 343 candidates have been nominated for the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize, out of which 251 are individuals and 92 are organizations. Last year, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to a Russian journalist, Dmitry Muratov, and a Philippine colleague, Maria Ressa.Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president of Ukraine in 2019 having promised to end the conflict in the Donbass region. However, under his leadership, Kiev has refused to negotiate with the breakaway regions. According to Russian officials, Zelensky’s administration was also preparing for a full-scale war against the newly-recognized republics while continuing to bombard its civilians, a charge Kiev rejects. After a seven-year standoff over the disputed implementation of the Minsk agreements, on February 24 the Kremlin launched a military attack on Ukraine. Zelensky has accused Russia of waging war without any legitimate reason."

Lawmakers are likely to add even more funding, as representatives from both parties have complained it doesn’t go far enough because of inflation.“I’m calling for one of the largest investments in our national security in history, with the funds needed to ensure that our military remains the best-prepared, best-trained, best-equipped military in the world,” Biden said in a statement on Monday.While the proposed budget is the highest-ever dollar amount in US history, inflation means that in real terms it would be a 1.5% increase rather than the nominal 4%. Democrats and Republicans alike on Capitol Hill have pushed for a 5-7% increase instead, according to Politico. Congress had approved $782 billion for the current fiscal year.The White House draft seeks $773 billion for the Pentagon alone, with the rest going to the Department of Energy, which maintains the US nuclear arsenal. Biden is asking for an additional $682 million for Ukraine, “to counter Russian malign influence and to meet emerging needs related to security, energy, cybersecurity issues, disinformation, macroeconomic stabilization, and civil society resilience,” a budget document says. This does not appear to be a response to the current conflict, however, as Stars and Stripes reported that the proposal was largely finished before Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing a Pentagon official.The budget envisions an active-duty force of 1.32 million, with some service branches downsizing while others add strength. The Air Force would add almost 100 and the Space Force almost 200 new personnel, while the army, navy and the Marines would trim about 4,300 or so combined.Research and development funding would be boosted by 9.5% to hit $130.1 billion, the largest-ever increase. Members of the military and civilian Pentagon employees would also get a 4.6% pay rise, the largest in 20 years.Big-ticket purchases include two Virginia-class submarines, more funding for the development of Northrop Grumman’s B-21 bomber, and a smaller purchase of F-35 jets from Lockheed Martin than envisioned previously, according to Bloomberg.While the budget wants $6.9 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative – almost double from the $3.6 billion request in 2022 – and $1.8 billion for expanding the US military presence in the Indo-Pacific, the base upgrade budget for facilities facing China came in at $451 million, compared to $245 million requested for Europe.Biden had ordered a total withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan last August, arguing among other things that the 20-year war had cost far too much in terms of American money and lives. The US-backed government in Kabul surrendered to the Taliban two weeks before the last American soldier flew out."

His attempt to evoke the specter of the Holocaust and draw comparisons with the Russian offensive in Ukraine triggered a harsh pushback from Israeli lawmakers.In a video address to the Knesset, Zelensky claimed that the time had come for the people of Israel to make a clear choice whether they support Ukraine or Russia. The president apparently referred to the position of Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who has expressed his readiness to facilitate the talks between Kiev and Moscow but, unlike many Western leaders and some of its allies, refrained from imposing harsh sanctions on Moscow or providing military assistance to Kiev. Earlier this week Bennett said that Israel would “continue to act to prevent bloodshed and bring the sides from the battlefield to the conference table.”“Mediation can be between states, not between good and evil,” Zelensky stated. He backed up his call with the words of the former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, who was born in Ukraine: “We intend to remain alive. Our neighbors want to see us dead. This is not a question that leaves much room for compromise.”The Ukrainian leader also took aim at Israel’s reluctance to provide its Iron Dome air defense systems to Ukraine, telling parliamentarians that it was “the best” of its kind, and that Israel would be able to protect “the lives of Ukrainians, the lives of Ukrainian Jews.” Zelensky also wondered why Israel hasn’t imposed “strong sanctions against Russia.”“But it is up to you, dear brothers and sisters, to choose the answer. And you will have to live with this answer, people of Israel,” he added.In the most fiery part of his address, Zelensky accused Russians of echoing the rhetoric of the Nazis, who called for “the final solution to the Jewish issue.” He claimed that similar words are sounding now from Moscow, but “in relation, so to speak, to us, to the ‘Ukrainian issue.’”Such comparisons, as well as his remarks about Ukrainian people who “made their choice 80 years ago” to rescue Jews, caused certain anger among Israeli lawmakers and media, with some calling them an attempt to “rewrite history” and deny the role of Ukrainian Nazi collaborators in Holocaust.“His criticism of Israel was legitimate, as was his raising expectations of us, but not his infuriating and ridiculous comparison to the Holocaust and his attempt to rewrite history and to erase the role of the Ukrainian people in the attempts to exterminate the Jewish people,” Religious Zionist Party leader Bezalel Smotrich said.Zalensky’s claim “borders on Holocaust denial,” said Likud MK Yuval Steinitz. “War is always a terrible thing… but every comparison between a regular war, as difficult as it is, and the extermination of millions of Jews in gas chambers in the framework of the Final Solution is a complete distortion of history.”Communications Minister and New Hope MP Yoaz Hendel tweeted that he “admires” Zelensky and supports the Ukrainian people “in heart and deed,” but noted that part of Nazi Germany’s genocide of Jews “was also carried out on Ukrainian land.” While “the war is terrible, the comparison to the horrors of the Holocaust and the Final Solution is outrageous,” he added.The Israeli government chose not to officially comment on the Ukrainian president’s controversial remarks. “We will continue to help the Ukrainian people as much as we can  and we will never turn our backs on the plight of people who know the horrors of war,” the country’s Foreign Minister Yair Lapid wrote on Twitter, reiterating his condemnation “of the attack on Ukraine.”Knesset Speaker Mickey Levy thanked Zelensky and said he was praying for an end to the war in Ukraine. He also expressed hope that when it happens, Zelensky would visit Jerusalem.Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow’s military offensive aims to “demilitarize and denazify” Ukraine’s government. Kiev has repeatedly denied it has a problem with radical nationalism, often pointing to its Jewish president as proof, even though Ukraine has embraced a number of World War II Nazi collaborators, such as Stepan Bandera. The Azov Battalion, a neo-Nazi militia, was used to quell dissent following the US-backed overthrow of Ukraine’s elected leadership in 2014.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

","Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has rejected reports about the alleged poisoning of Russian businessman Roman Abramovich, calling such reports a ""part of the information warfare"" going on. He said that this part of information warfare ""should be treated accordingly"" and that one should ""filter the flow of information very meticulously"". ""Our delegation is headed by [Russian] presidential aide [Vladimir] Medinsky. But, nevertheless, from our side, he (Abramovich) is also present in Istanbul"", Peskov said.  According to him, Abramovich's involvement in the Istanbul talks has been approved by both sides. The remarks followed The Wall Street Journal reporting on Monday about symptoms of poisoning related to Abramovich, something that was allegedly detected after his participation in the Moscow-Kiev talks in early March. The symptoms purportedly included redness of eyes, constant and painful tearing, as well peeling of the skin on the face and hands. The Moscow-Kiev talks are being held amid Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 24 February. He said that the goal of the operation is to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine, with Russia's Defence Ministry stressing that only Ukrainian military infrastructure will be targeted with high-precision weapons and that the civilian population is not in danger.

Russia and India have enjoyed close ties since Soviet times.New Delhi abstained during the UN General Assembly vote to condemn Moscow in early March. Truss explained India’s stance at the time by reference to “some level of dependence on Russia,” suggesting that the UK should foster “a closer economic and defense relationship” with the Asian country.Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, meanwhile, said the UK was “very disappointed” by India’s unwillingness to condemn Russia.A similar point was made by Mira Rapp-Hooper, a senior US diplomat responsible for the Indo-Pacific region, who called India’s position this month “unsatisfactory,” but “totally unsurprising.”India has championed the policy of non-alignment since its independence in 1947. Jaishankar said last week that the Ukrainian crisis can only be resolved through “dialogue and diplomacy.”India is Russia’s biggest arms customer, with half of its total weapons imports coming from Moscow.The Hindustan Times quoted sources as saying that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will meet with Jaishankar on April 1.Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

The US-led military bloc also warned Beijing against trying to help Moscow circumvent Western sanctions.Following an extraordinary summit in Brussels, devoted to Russia’s military offensive against the former Soviet state, NATO issued a statement, which, on top of sharp criticism of Moscow, contained warnings to Beijing as well.“We call on all states, including the People’s Republic of China (PRC),” the document reads, “to abstain from supporting Russia’s war effort in any way, and to refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions.” NATO’s statement goes on to express concern over “recent public comments by PRC officials,” urging “China to cease amplifying the Kremlin’s false narratives, in particular on the war and on NATO.”The Kremlin’s military campaign in Ukraine poses the “gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades,” NATO leaders argued. The statement calls on President Vladimir Putin to “immediately stop this war and withdraw military forces from Ukraine,” as well as “to allow rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access and safe passage for civilians.”A resolution proposed by Russia at the UN Security Council on Wednesday called for a ceasefire in Ukraine to facilitate civilian in leaving the areas worst affected by fighting. However, the document was not adopted as only Russia and China voted for it, while the 13 other members of the Security Council abstained.In its statement, NATO accused Russian forces of staging “devastating attacks on civilians, including women, children,” – something Moscow has strongly denied.The military alliance also warned those “responsible for violations of humanitarian and international law, including war crimes” that they would be held accountable.Moreover, NATO leaders made a pledge to “counter Russia’s lies about its attack on Ukraine and expose fabricated narratives.”The closing paragraphs of the statement are devoted to the measures NATO has taken over the past month, and those it is planning to implement in the near future. Since 2014, the military alliance has admittedly been providing “extensive support” to Ukraine, with assistance also going to other countries outside of NATO “affected by Russian threats and interference.”On February 24, President Vladimir Putin announced the start of a military campaign in Ukraine, which was preceded by Russia’s decision to recognize the two Donbass republics. According to the Kremlin, it was Ukraine’s reluctance to implement the Minsk agreements which led to the escalation. The accords brokered back in 2015 by Germany and France were meant to have regularized the status of those breakaway regions within Ukraine.Among Moscow’s objectives in the current conflict are firm guarantees that Ukraine will become a neutral state, and will not join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev and its Western allies, in turn, dismiss all of the above as merely a pretext for waging “unprovoked” aggression against a sovereign nation."

The negotiator noted that Ukraine has also agreed in principle to reject the deployment of foreign bases or troops on its territory, and to an obligation to conduct military exercises only with the consent of guarantor states, including Russia. Medinsky recalled that until recently, Ukraine and NATO had ignored Russian proposals to hold talks aimed at guaranteeing Ukrainian security while protecting Russia's national interests. ""Ukraine's entry into NATO and the creation of NATO military bases on its territory seemed to be a settled matter, and only a question of time."" The country was working on the creation of biological weapons with US patrons, and ""the issue of Ukraine's acquisition of nuclear weapons was also thrown into the public sphere. For all these years, the Kiev regime has been carrying out an outright genocide against the inhabitants of the Donbass region. There is no end to evidence on this matter,"" he said. At the same time, the presidential aide said that evidence has been presented by Moscow that Kiev had been preparing to launch an offensive in the Donbass in the near future, forcing Russia to act when it did or risk a new massacre. Medinsky stressed that Moscow's position on the status of the Donbass (as independent republics) and Crimea (as part of Russia) remains unchanged. His comments followed remarks by Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov earlier on Wednesday that Crimea's status was not up for negotiation. Medinsky and the Russian delegation met with their Ukrainian counterparts in Istanbul, Turkey on Tuesday for another round of negotiations aimed at ending the month-old Russian military operation in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after the talks, Medinsky said that along with the security guarantees, the two sides discussed Ukraine's possible membership in the European Union (to which he said Moscow does not object in principle), and the idea of having guarantor-states that would ensure Kiev's security, among other issues. Russian deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, who was present with Medinsky at the talks, said Russia would dramatically reduce its military operations in the Kiev and Chernigov regions in a bid to ""increase mutual trust"" and create preconditions for further negotiations. Russia began a large-scale military operation in Ukraine on 24 February after weeks of escalating mortar and artillery fire and sabotage and sniper attacks against the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, whose sovereignty Moscow recognised on 21 February. The security crisis followed nearly eight years of civil war in eastern Ukraine between Kiev forces and the Donbass breakaways, which proclaimed themselves separate states in the aftermath of a western-backed coup d'etat in Kiev in February 2014.

However, a brief video of the gathering ahead of the traditional NATO family photo, posted on Twitter, left netizens “embarrassed” for the UK Prime Minister.","Boris Johnson elicited sympathy from netizens, “embarrassed” for the UK Prime Minister, as a short video of EU leaders gathering for a NATO “family photo” made the rounds on the internet. A clip of the meeting showed a smiling French President Emmanuel Macron shaking hands with other EU leaders just a few feet from Boris Johnson, who appeared to look around awkwardly, his hands in his pockets. Some social media users quipped that the British PM was an “embarrassment,” while others suggested the appeared “snub” showed what world leaders think of “global Britain.” Previously, Johnson and Macron have failed to see eye to eye on a range of policy issues. Thus, the UK Prime Minister told his French counterpart last September to “donnez-moi un break” in response to Paris’s anger over the AUKUS-botched sub deal. The diplomatic row was triggered by Canberra’s decision to cancel the multi-billion diesel-electric submarine deal with Paris in the wake of AUKUS three-way alliance formation. Meanwhile, in December it was reported that Macron referred to Johnson as a “clown” in private conversation. Another user on Twitter has dubbed Boris Johnson’s look in the clip “Mr Lonely,” adding, “I loved his wave at the end when the hospitality trolley arrived with the sausage rolls.” Others on Twitter wrote the incident called for some appropriate “tear-jerker” music accompaniment. Still other social media users believed that the entire video would show “who’s having an awkward moment.” "

As a result of the incident, the oil deficit on the world market is expected to increase significantly, according to experts.The pipeline, which ships around 1.2 million barrels of crude oil daily from Kazakhstan to Europe and the US, said in a statement the condition of two hoses has not allowed “safe operation of the device.”“We have to eliminate any risk of oil getting into the sea, so, of course, this equipment was to be decommissioned for preventive maintenance,” CPC Director General Nikolay Gorban explained.He said that the repairs on each of the damaged floating hoses – which should be fixed one after another rather than simultaneously – would take at least three weeks. However, the weather conditions remain a major factor when it comes to the work timeline.For now, the company has all the necessary equipment for repairs, but the supply of the spare parts might arise in the future, taking into consideration the current circumstances, the CPC warned.“In this situation, the management of the Consortium has to report possible reduction in the volume of oil transportation in the nearest future by a factor of three from the requests of shippers,” the pipeline, which is co-owned by Russia, Kazakhstan, and a number of major international oil market players, said in a statement.Temporary disruption to the operation of one of the biggest pipelines in the world will affect many, but especially consumers in southern Europe – Italy, Spain, and the south of France traditionally receive oil from the affected CPC’s remote mooring device, Russia’s Financial University expert and leading analyst of the National Energy Security Fund Igor Yushkov said.“There is already a deficit in the world market, and when a pretty large player reduces shipments, at least from this terminal, this will aggravate the deficit, and, apparently, will push the oil prices up,” he said, adding that a redirection of the supplies would “require time and additional costs.”Besides southern Europe, the incident on CPC might be “an unpleasant event for the US,” Yushkov said.“About 10-15% of volumes went (from this terminal) to the US market. For the United States, this is also an unpleasant event – they have just rejected the Russian oil, they need to look for an alternative supplier, and then another supplier interrupts supplies. Therefore, as a result, fuel prices in the US domestic market may rise,” the expert claimed.The timing of the incident, in Yushkov’s words, is “very unfortunate.” “If this event coincides with other factors, a perfect storm could set in and prices could soar back to $140 to $150 a barrel,” he said.The good thing about today’s news is that the problem is only temporary, stressed another expert, Kirill Rodionov from the Institute for the Development of Technologies in the Fuel and Energy Complex. According to his calculations, “starting from the third quarter, CPC will resume oil shipments in the same volumes.”The Russian authorities have pledged to do what they can to reduce the disruption.“Naturally, we would like the recovery to happen as quickly as possible and the consequences to be eliminated, because this affects Russian companies, this affects, among other things, the production of Russian companies in the region. So, of course, we will do our best here to address these potentially serious consequences,” Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin said.Global energy markets have responded with shock and volatility to the conflict in Ukraine, with US gas prices reaching historic records earlier this month. Decisions by the US and the UK to ban Russian energy imports have also put tremendous pressure on the market."

Still less how a WMD incident could possibly get its back away from the wall. That would be a far too rational question to ask. Given the history of American false flags from the Gulf of Tonkin through to the War on Terror, the rational assumption was the Goebellian one – accuse your enemy of that which you intend to do.

But the Russian economy must be absolutely integrated into international trade and open economic ties. We must provide our wealth for the development of global civilization, while also using the best technologies from other countries for the benefit of our own people.”He also responded to recent media reports claiming that Russia has now ‘outraced’ Iran as the world’s most sanctioned country. Moscow has seen more than 2,700 new curbs slapped on it by the US, EU and other countries since February 22 – almost as many as in all previous years since 2014. “We didn’t outrace anybody. It’s the Americans who outraced themselves in implementing such decisions,” Shuvalov said.More harsh sanctions were imposed against Russia after it sent its troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the breakaway Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."

It is also stepping up preparations for dealing with the aftermath of a possible chemical or biological attack.“The commission is working to ensure it enhances preparedness in the area of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats generally, and this predates the war in Ukraine,” a spokesman told the Financial Times on Monday.Russia put its nuclear weapons on high alert a few days after launching its military operation in Ukraine in late February, citing what it described as the “aggressive statements” made by NATO and the draconian financial sanctions imposed by the West.In early March, there was a fire at Ukraine’s Zaporozhskaya nuclear power plant, which has been seized by Russian forces. The blaze was swiftly extinguished, with the International Atomic Energy Agency saying there had been “no critical impact on safety” at the plant.A few days later, Moscow announced it had prevented an attempt by what it called Ukrainian radicals to cut power to the former Chernobyl nuclear power station, which became the site of the world’s most devastating nuclear disaster in 1986.The two incidents have led to a spike in demand in the EU, Russia, and even the US for potassium-iodine pills, which help reduce the impact of radiation on the human system. Earlier in March, pharmacies in Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and elsewhere reported that they has run out of the medication.The EU’s preparations for nuclear incidents are being led by the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), which was established last September after the bloc was caught off guard by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, European lawmakers have insisted that HERA needs to work faster in order to keep up with the pace of events in Ukraine.“We need to draw strong lessons from Covid. We require specific measures for nuclear sites. We are not ready. We do not have the stocks,” Véronique Trillet-Lenoir, a European parliamentarian representing French president Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche party, said, adding that the bloc also had to develop a system of alerts and monitoring.Russia sent its troops into Ukraine on 24 February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

It’s the latest of numerous incidents of civilian transport being seized for the war effort by Kiev, Moscow’s envoy to the UN Security Council complained on Tuesday.Vassily Nebenzia warned that it created a situation where, for example, medical vehicles could be used to deliver Western weapons into the country.“We are expecting a response to our latest inquiry about the UN vehicle with the diplomatic number DP210015, which was also taking part in Kharkov in combat operations of the Ukrainian nationalists, according to witness accounts,” he said.The vehicle he mentioned was apparently spotted in a video released by Ukrainian fighters to show off the shooting down of an aircraft. It was reportedly used to transport anti-aircraft missiles.The diplomat said there were credible reports that official vehicles of the UN and the OSCE were used by Ukrainian forces. He called on both organizations to “give fair assessments of such facts.”Nebenzia also mentioned evidence of DHL delivery vans being used for combat in Ukraine. A video showing a Ukrainian mortar team apparently using such a vehicle to move around was published on Reddit last weekend.Mortar crews of Ukraine also use cars of the delivery service ""DHL"" for movement. pic.twitter.com/Gc6IN99TRDOne of the fighters shown in the video claimed the van was one of six voluntarily donated to the war effort by the Ukrainian branch of the German company. DHL shut down all operations in the country in early March. It told Russian media that the Ukrainian authorities had confiscated corporate transport.The Russian diplomat said cases such as these have disturbing ramifications in terms of telling apart civilian and military targets in Ukraine.“We cannot rule out that vehicles of these organizations or vehicles marked as medical transport could be used to deliver to Ukraine from neighboring states the very same weapons that the West has generously promised to Kiev,” he said.Moscow has repeatedly warned that it will consider any arms shipments to Ukraine as legitimate military targets."

Tod Wolters, commander of US European Command told American senators on 29 March, falling short of specifying whether he meant permanent basing. In recent months, US military forces have soared from roughly 60,000 to 102,000 in Europe.","""America’s presence in Europe is one of regional domination over Western Europe and encroachment and encirclement across Eastern Europe along Russia’s borders,"" says Brian Berletic, a geopolitical analyst and former US Marine. ""It has always been a process of escalation, edging ever closer to a conflict with Russia either directly or, as we see unfolding in Ukraine right now, by proxy."" During a Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday hearing, Gen. Tod Wolters was asked by Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) whether the US should increase the number of troops permanently stationed in Europe, rather than the rotating forces. Wolters responded that his ""suspicion is"" that the US is going to still need more troops in the region ""following the completion of the Ukraine-Russia scenario."" The general added, however, that the Pentagon has to ""examine the European contributions to make a smart decision about where to go in the future."" Still, Wolters' remarks left more questions than answers, as it remains unclear whether the additional US military forces would be deployed on a permanent basis. Ritter explains that the US has made it clear that the day of it paying for the expense of sending and sustaining American troops overseas all by itself is over, and it's up to Europe now ""to pay at least a significant part of the cost of hosting these troops."" The general is aware of these financial and political unknowns, hence his hesitance, adds the military analyst. Meanwhile, the number of US troops deployed across Europe has soared from 60,000 to about 102,000 since October 2021. For comparison's sake, NATO-allied European states hosted a total of 450,000 US military servicemen in 1957, during the Cold War era, according to Axios. Under the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, the transatlantic bloc is prohibited from ""permanent stationing of substantial combat forces"" on its eastern flank. At the same time, one needs to understand that ""the composition of the American forces in Europe right now do not represent the ideal composition of forces that would be needed if the purpose of these forces was to serve as a deterrent against any hypothetical Russian military aggression against NATO,"" argues Ritter. In order to effectively deter Russia, the US would have to deploy heavy armored brigades in Europe and keep them permanently there, according to the military analyst. However, it would be expensive for the US to provide these units, and it would be costly for any EU nation to host them, he explains. Furthermore, a meaningful deterrent value would require not one brigade, not two brigades, but probably nine brigades, according to Ritter. ""That's beyond the capacity of the US Army today to provide,"" he says. ""So we would have to form new armored brigades which are a very expensive proposition."" The US' apparent plan to beef up its military presence in Europe is caused by the fact that Washington's role in Europe ""has always been one of domination over its so-called 'allies' and of ensuring conflict rather than cooperation between Europe and Russia,"" according to Brian Berletic. According to Berletic, if there were no US military presence and no economic or political coercion used by the US, Nord Stream 2 would already be operational, with Europeans ""enjoying cheap, plentiful, and dependable hydrocarbons from Russia."" Instead, the EU has recently been thrown under the bus by the US and is now ""risking socio-economic ruination,"" the geopolitical analyst points out. Still, EU member states also bear responsibility for the current state of affairs, according to Scott Ritter. He highlights that Europe has long been excessively dependent on the US in terms of security. Ritter outlines two solutions for Europe which would have ensured its strategic autonomy: · to work with Russia to redefine a European security framework that de-emphasises the possibility of armed conflict; · if security cooperation with Moscow wasn't something that was politically acceptable for Europe, to build up its own inherent military capability to ""deter Russia."" As the world evolves away from a West-centered unipolar system and embraces multi-polarity, it would be more reasonable for Europe to find a way to economically and politically coexist with Russia, according to the military analyst. This scenario is fraught with further risks, as the Biden administration appears to be interested in prolonging the conflict in Ukraine for as long as possible, thus deepening the rift between Europe and Russia, argues Brian Berletic. US officials' apparent plans to turn Ukraine into Afghanistan 2.0 and amass American troops in Europe could ruin any prospect of healthy and mutually beneficial bilateral relations between Russia and the Old Continent, according to the former US Marine.

Such an involvement would be a disaster, says David T. Pyne, a former U.S. Department of Defenсe officer.","On 9 March, James Jeffrey, a US diplomat who served as Special Representative for the Syria Engagement, proposed creating a ""humanitarian safe zone"" in Western Ukraine under UN Chapter VI in order to put US boots on the ground. According to the diplomat, for this idea to succeed, Joe Biden ""would have to reverse, to a limited degree, his 'no US boots-in-Ukraine' position, but for good reasons."" Less than a week later, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) made the appeal for a NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Western Ukraine. Under Kaczynski's plan the peacekeeping mission would be backed by armed forces. According to Pyne, some Western politicians are guided by flawed historical analogues: they are wrongfully equating Russia to Nazi Germany, ""bent on the conquest of Europe"", and claiming that any concessions to Moscow would be nothing short of a 1938 Munich Pact-style ""appeasement"". Hence Warsaw's apparent desire ""to get NATO to fight Russia in Ukraine despite the fact that there is virtually no evidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin has any intention of attacking Poland,"" he adds. Moscow has repeatedly warned NATO member-states against intervening in Ukraine amid Russia's special operation, which was launched on 24 February in order to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" the nation. Washington and NATO have dismissed Warsaw's plan and have ruled out the bloc's intervention so far. However, a team of national security officials brought together by the White House have been discussing potential scenarios under which the transatlantic military alliance could get involved in Ukraine, according to The New York Times. Instead of incentivising both Ukraine and the Russian Federation to negotiate a compromise peace agreement, the US and its NATO allies are sending more weapons to Ukraine making President Volodymyr Zelensky much less willing to negotiate the Russian demands, according to the former Pentagon officer. The truth is that the military action could likely have been avoided if the Biden Administration had simply provided a written guarantee to Moscow that Ukraine would never be admitted into NATO, according to the EMP Task Force scholar. ""Russia did not ask for the rollback of NATO’s eastern boundaries, merely that it would never be expanded eastward into additional former Soviet republics,"" he says. ""This was an eminently reasonable request."" He notes that the fact that the US and NATO leaders viewed Russia's draft security agreements, submitted in mid-December 2021, as ""unacceptable"" shows that ""they are incapable of understanding Russia’s legitimate security concerns and seem unable to understand that Russia is one of the most powerful nuclear superpowers in the world and thus the US and NATO would be wise to see that its vital interests should be respected in exchange for Russia respecting our own."" On 29 March, Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in Istanbul, Turkey, to discuss peace proposals. Chief Russian Negotiator Vladimir Medinsky revealed that they received written proposals from Ukraine confirming Kiev's readiness for ""a neutral, non-aligned and non-nuclear status, along with a refusal to produce and deploy all types of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and bacteriological ones, and a ban on the presence of foreign military bases and foreign troops on the territory of the country."" Medinsky elaborated that the position of Kiev will be reviewed by Moscow and presented to President Vladimir Putin. Further negotiations will continue via video conferences for now, according to the chief negotiator. On the same day, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu stated that Russia had accomplished the main tasks of the first phase of the special military operation. According to Shoigu, the combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces has been significantly reduced and now the Russian military can shift to liberating Donbass. Moscow has also announced plans to take military and political de-escalation steps as Kiev demonstrates constructive position with regard to Ukraine's neutral and non-nuclear status. In particular, there would be ""significant reduction"" of military activities in the Kiev and Chernigov directions. Medinsky specified, however, that the move doesn't mean ceasefire and that the advance of the Russian military and Donbass militias continues. Some Western observers rushed to describe Russia's strategic shift as a sign of weakness, claiming that Moscow's initial plan envisaged occupation of Ukraine and capturing its main cities, including Kiev. Still, Russia made it clear from the start that it had no intention to occupy Ukraine. If Russia wanted to occupy Ukraine it would have amassed a much more powerful force; instead it employed approximately 40% of its ground combat units, constituting only 20% of its active duty military forces, according to the EMP Task Force scholar. According to Pyne, Russia's special operation was ""more of a preventative attack from the Russian perspective in reaction to"": ·          Biden’s decision to sign a strategic partnership agreement with Ukraine back in November committing the US to support their joining NATO; ·         the US and NATO's rejection of a mutual security agreement with Russia offered in December 2021, with the limited objectives of ensuring Ukraine’s neutrality and demilitarisation.

Operating in 25 states, it employs civilians who have no accountability before Congress and can bypass the law due to the lack of direct oversight.  The program whose existence has been confirmed by none other than Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland at a Senate Committee hearing on March 8th has been dismissed by the majority of American mainstream media as “conspiracy” in a desperate effort to sweep under the rug one of America’s best kept secrets inside Ukraine. And while the program itself is much larger – stretching across Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia – it is its Ukrainian branch that’s been causing anxiety in the Pentagon as well as the Biden administration for the fear that it might fall into the hands of Russian forces.  So what exactly has been going on in the US bio labs in Ukraine? The bio laboratories are operated by the DTRA military program. Furthermore, civilian personnel of these private companies can operate on behalf of the US government under diplomatic cover – a practice commonly resorted to by the CIA.  There are three such companies operating in Ukraine - Metabiota Inc., Southern Research Institute and Black&amp;Veatch, with key posts held by former, and in some cases, current high-ranking military and intelligence officers.  Besides the Pentagon, these companies run federal biological research projects for the CIA and other government agencies. According to various sources, the DTRA finances about 15 biological laboratories in Ukraine, with data accumulated on ten of them: In accordance with an agreement between the US Department of Defense and Ukraine’s Ministry of Health, dated 2005, the Kiev government is prohibited from disclosing any ""sensitive"" information about the American program. In the meantime Ukraine is under obligation to transfer dangerous pathogens from the labs on its territory to the Pentagon for further biological research, in return the US military is granted access to Ukraine’s state secrets related to the ongoing projects. However, a certain US-funded organization, “The Science and Technology Center in Ukraine” (STCU), was set up the country even before the agreement in question. With its employees endowed with diplomatic status, the center officially supports the projects of scientists who previously worked on Soviet programs to create weapons of mass destruction.  Over the past 20 years, STCU has funneled $285 million in funding and managed an estimated 1850 projects worldwide, The work is officially carried out in line with the 1991-launched programme to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The stated goal is to ensure safe storage and destruction of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as their means of delivery, in the countries of the former Soviet Union. Since Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan destroyed their arsenal of nuclear warheads, on paper the program ended in 2013. However, in 2021, a bill was introduced in the US Congress to renew the programme ostensibly to the “reemerged threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass annihilation”. However, according to the Federal Public Procurement website, the programme never actually stopped its operation. In 2013, one of the DTRA contractors for the programme's execution in Ukraine was Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC, with the contract worth $ 43.9 million. In 2016, the STCU itself won a five-year DTRA contract to provide scientific and technical services to a tune of $10 million. Currently, there is no clarity regarding the scope of the STCU’s ongoing activity in Ukraine. While not all of the research is traceable to a tee, US Biolabs mushrooming across Ukraine soil and the American financing of STCU projects coincided with several outbreaks of serious infectious diseases in the country. In January 2016 at least 20 Ukrainian soldiers died of a flu-like virus within a matter of two days in Kharkov, home to one of the US-run laboratories. More than 200 people were hospitalized at the time. By March 2016, 364 fatal cases were recorded throughout Ukraine. The cause of 81% of deaths was swine influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 – the same one that triggered a global pandemic of the disease in 2009. More recently, another sudden outbreak of an infectious disease, Hepatitis A, was registered in the south-east of Ukraine – also the site of several Pentagon biolabs. Last January, 37 residents of Nikolaev were hospitalized with jaundice, prompting local police to launch an investigation into suspected ""deliberate infection with the human immunodeficiency virus and other incurable diseases.” Three years ago, more than 100 people in that same city fell ill with cholera. In both cases, it was assumed that the cause was contaminated drinking water. Back in the summer of 2017, 60 people were hospitalized with Hepatitis A in Zaporozhye – the cause of that outbreak remains unknown. In Odessa region, 19 children had the same diagnosis, while in November 2017, 27 cases were registered in Kharkov. The virus was discovered in potable water. Ukraine witnessed an outbreak of cholera in 2011, with 33 people hospitalized with diarrhea. In 2014, more than 800 people were diagnosed with cholera, with cases spread out across the country. While the outbreaks themselves are hardly evidence enough of any foul play, the diseases in question correlate curiously with the list of the dangerous pathogens the US laboratories have been researching. For example, the Southern Research Institute has a project on cholera, as well as viruses of influenza and Zika – all of them designated by the Pentagon as pathogens of military importance. Besides the Southern Research Institute, laboratories in Ukraine are managed by two other companies, Black&amp;Veatch and Metabiota. Founded in 1915 in Kansas City, Missouri, Black &amp; Veatch is currently headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas. It specializes in mining, data centers, smart cities, banking and financial markets. In 2020, Black &amp; Veatch was the 7th largest company in the US, boasting a revenue of $3.7 billion in 2020. The activity of Black &amp; Veatch, with a web of over 100 offices around the world, since its inception has been inextricably linked with the US army and intelligence agencies. Black&amp;Veatch won two five-year DTRA contracts worth $198.7 million to build and manage bio laboratories in Ukraine, Germany, Azerbaijan, Cameroon, Thailand, Ethiopia, Vietnam and Armenia. The Federal Purchasing website states that in Ukraine alone Pentagon contractor Black&amp;Veatch has DTRA commitments in line with the ""Biological Joint Participation Program"" worth $140 million since 2013, with work to a tune of $ 77 million yet to be completed. In 2014, Metabiota, specializing in identifying, monitoring and analysing potential disease outbreaks, signed an $18.4 million federal contract as a subcontractor for Black &amp; Veatch in Georgia and Ukraine. Non-profit Southern Research first founded in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1941, as the Alabama Research Institute, conducts fundamental and applied research for commercial and non-profit organizations in four areas: development of medicine, energy, environment and engineering. Throughout the past 70 years, Southern Research has been engaged in research activities linked with national defense. Its early programs for the US Department of Defense included the development of heat- resistant materials for rocket systems returning to Earth's atmosphere. Over the decades, Southern Research expanded the direction of its work to the development of ballistic missile systems, hypersonic vehicles, etc. Since 2008, Southern Research Institute has been the main subcontractor in Ukraine. In 2001 the firm became a Pentagon subcontractor for anthrax research. The main contractor was Advanced Biosystems, led at the time by Ken Alibek, a former Soviet microbiologist and expert in biological weapons from Kazakhstan, who left for the US in 1992. Southern Research Institute is known for actively lobbying research programmes for US intelligence in Congress and the State Department at around the same time that bio laboratories began to emerge in Ukraine and other countries of the former USSR. Thus, the company paid $250,000 to Senator Jeff Sessions (now -US Attorney General) for his lobbying services in 2008-2009, when the Institute won several federal contracts. Overall, from 2006 until 2016, Southern Research Institute forked out some $1.28 million on lobbying to the Senate, House of Representatives, Department of State and Department of Defense. Finally, Metabiota Inc. is the most private of the above-mentioned companies, linked to the biolabs in Ukraine. This could be explained by its links with the family of the President of the United States, Joe Biden, more specifically, his son, Hunter Biden. Founded in 2008, Metabiota is commissioned by governments, insurance companies and livestock breeders to research and evaluate infectious disease threats, digitize global microbial data and actively avert the spread of diseases. At the first stage, it was financed by Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners (RSTP), an offshoot of Rosemont Capital, an investment fund founded by Hunter Biden, the son of US President Joe Biden, and Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former US Secretary of State John Kerry in 2009, in which Biden was managing director. Hunter Biden’s shady former overseas dealings, which concealed a web of corruption in which he sought to use his father’s notoriety to secure unscrupulous business deals from Ukraine to Hong Kong, have swirled for years, but yielded no action on the part of the US or International authorities so far with an investigation still underway. Metabiota is listed in the archived portfolios of RSTP, with financial reports showing RSTP covered the first round of financing for the company to a tune of  $30 million. Since 2014, Metabiota has been a partner of the EcoHealth Alliance within the PREDICT Project of the project of USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program, which aims to carry out global surveillance for pathogens to ostensibly "" identify and prevent the threat of new emerging infectious diseases”. However, as part of these efforts, researchers from Metabiota, EcoHealth Alliance and Wuhan Institute of Virology jointly conducted a study on infectious diseases of bats in China.  Researchers from the EcoHealth Alliance and Metabiota also collaborated over controversial projects on how to ""live safely with bats"", and research linking emerging infectious disease outbreaks with trade in wild animals. Researchers from Metabiota were also listed along with EcoHealth Alliance staff in a 2014 study on the dissemination of the Nipah henipavirus, Ebola monitoring study in 2014, herpes study in 2015. In April 2021, USAID announced a new taxpayer-funded project, led by the EcoHealth Alliance, to track new infections diseases with pandemic potential. Metabiota, whose researchers were listed as authors of articles dated June 2021 related to coronavirus surveillance in Africa, are also linked to the new project spearheaded by EcoHealth Alliance. Metabiota has long been connected to a well-known controversial CIA front, In-Q-Tel, created in 1999 as ""the first state-sponsored venture capital company”. In-Q-Tel is an American non-profit venture capital firm based in Arlington, Virginia, founded to boost national security by ""connecting the Central Intelligence Agency and US intelligence community with venture-backed entrepreneurial companies"". The firm, founded by Norm Augustine, former CEO of Lockheed Martin, and Gilman Louis, who was the first CEO of In Q-Tel, is considered a trendsetter in the information technology industry. In-Q-Tel received funding for at least $120 million in 2016, mainly from the CIA, but also the NSA, FBI and US Department of Defense While In-Q-Tel operates partially publicly, there is a shroud of secrecy over its products and their use, with the most famous known ones being analytical systems for Palantir Technologies data analysis and encrypted messages sharing application. With documents in hand, Russia addressed the damning evidence pertaining to the US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. On 11 March the UN Security Council gathered for a special meeting convened at Russia’s request to discuss the issue. However,  the UN Under-Secretary-General of Disarmament Affairs, Izumi Nakamitsu, said the UN was “not aware” of any biological weapons program in Ukraine. Washington was quick to denounce Russia’s claims, with Ned Price, spokesperson for the Department of State, accusing it of “inventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own actions in Ukraine.” Russia will demand an explanation of the involvement of Hunter Biden, the son of the American President, in funding pathogen research in Ukraine, said the Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ""...This is very sensitive information - both for us and for the whole world. Of course, we will demand explanations. And we are not alone in it: you know that China has already demanded clarifications from the US, urging them to make this situation transparent to the world..."" emphasized Peskov. "

However, despite the horrific bloodshed inflicted on the Iraqi people, the Western public seem to have forgotten so many of the lessons that should have been taken away from the disaster that was the Iraq War.In the build-up to the war on Iraq, Americans were told that eliminating Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, was necessary for world peace. This was due to his alleged possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) as well as his alleged links with Al-Qaeda, among a number of other claims about Hussein’s genocidal ambitions. Britain’s then-prime minister, Tony Blair, even likened Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler; this was at a time when anti-Middle Eastern sentiment was high and the 9/11 attacks were ripe in the minds of the Western public, who had been informed by then-US President George W. Bush that the ‘war on terror’ was akin to a ‘crusade’.It turned out that almost none of the major allegations about Saddam Hussein were true, despite the Iraqi president’s other crimes against humanity. Yet, with no evidence, Western media fell in line and presented the invasion of Iraq as a just war, despite the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) in Geneva stating that it constituted a war of aggression and a flagrant violation of international law prior to the invasion occurring. Likely due in large part to the media coverage at the time, which had demonized everything Middle Eastern and Muslim, US public support for invading Iraq prior to ‘Operation Iraqi Liberation’ was between 52-64%, jumping up to 72% support on invasion day.In the first two months of the ‘Shock and Awe’ invasion of Iraq, more than 7,186 Iraqi civilians were said to have been killed. Yet, at the time, Western media outlets were celebrating the US-UK victory as if none of this death and destruction had taken place, never truly asking where the alleged WMD were. A BBC reporter, Andrew Marr, said on April 9 of British PM Tony Blair that “He said they would be able to take Baghdad without a bloodbath and in the end the Iraqis would be celebrating. And on both of those points he has been proven conclusively right.”The blindly pro-US-UK government coverage went on, despite reports of US and UK war crimes. For example, on April 2, 2003, US aircraft struck a Red Crescent maternity hospital in Baghdad, resulting in a massacre according to The Guardian.Within less than two years of the invasion, it is said that as many as 100,000 innocent Iraqi civilians were killed, yet George W. Bush still managed to get re-elected in 2004. This was with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) not granting permission for the invasion, countless reports of civilian targets being hit, and calls from anti-war voices for the prosecution of Bush and Blair for war crimes. On October 6, 2003, Time Magazine was still running cover for the Bush administration, only offering small criticisms of how President Bush miscalculated “fixing Iraq,” whilst The Economist went with a headline in May that read: ‘Now, the waging of peace’, which was endorsing the idea of nation-building in Iraq and ignoring the alleged war crimes.Eventually, all the major news outlets in the West, including the likes of CNN, BBC, Fox News, and others, bowed their heads in shame of their one-sided reporting on what had occurred in Iraq and what Noam Chomsky called their participation in ‘manufacturing consent’.Peter Van Buren, a former US State Department official based in Iraq for a year, was asked about whether the Western media had learnt its lesson from Iraq and said the following:“Lessons learned? No. La [‘no’ in Arabic]. Nyet [‘no’ in Russian]. As a State Department officer in 2003, I watched in horror as the mainstream press acted not only as stenographers for government lies but amplifiers of those lies, employing anonymous sources at the expense of their own credibility to create and then service a narrative demanding war. When their true editor-in-chief, George W. Bush, stood up, a mix of Ben Bradley and Lou Grant, to proclaim ‘you were either with us or with the terrorists,’ the media stifled dissent in their ranks nearly completely. In 2022, little has changed. The media again beats the drum for war, albeit this time as stenographers for the Ukrainian government’s propaganda. Almost all of the video and imagery out of Ukraine comes from their government and those anonymous sources of 2003 have been replaced by no real sourcing at all. Crushing dissent has caught up with the times, so voices for restraint are not just left off the New York Times op-ed page, they are canceled, deplatformed, and sent down the social media memory hole, unemployable as Putin-lovers.”Today, the crimes committed in Iraq are well known to the Western public, yet the former leaders of the United States and United Kingdom have never faced consequences for the chaos they caused. Not only has the war left Iraq divided, in terms of de-jure and societal ethno-religious division, but US forces are still stationed in Iraq in their thousands. NATO even announced early last year that they were expanding their own mission to 4,000 personnel in Iraq.In addition to this, Iraq has faced the rise and fall of ISIS, a sectarian Sunni-Shia war, US occupation, torture centers, and chemical weapon deployment against civilians, and this has stained the new collective memory of the new generation of Iraqis. The young generation of Iraqis now also face a corrupt Iraqi elite, installed into a confessionalist [sectarian] system of government, which has largely been based on a manufactured political culture of nepotism.Has the US even been able to claim victory in Iraq after 19 years of destruction? Absolutely not. Washington is still battling to hold enough power in the country in order to combat the role of neighboring Iran, which jumped in to fill the power vacuum with its allied forces who were established to fight ISIS and Al-Qaeda.Prior to the removal of Saddam Hussein, Iraq was not a country divided on sectarian lines and did not have a problem with Al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups. The country has been torn apart since 2003 and the same media organizations which religiously took the side of Western governments are today working as the same propaganda machines. The active undermining of the Iraqi experience of war, with countless Western journalists saying things like, we should care more because the bombs are dropping on “relatively civilised” people, can be put down to racism, and it is this sort of dangerous rhetoric which enables Western audiences to ignore the alleged 6 million victims of the failed ‘war on terror’. Until the perpetrators of the Iraq War are brought to justice, the US government cannot claim the moral high ground over its adversaries, and its position on the world stage shall forever be tainted. "

Unfortunately, large countries, such as Germany, but also small ones, such as Austria and Hungary, are more restrained. They refrain from stopping trade with Russia here and now,” the prime minister said ahead of NATO talks in Brussels, adding that he hopes to convince them to share Poland’s point of view. Morawiecki said Poland’s stance towards Russia amid the offensive in Ukraine has not changed, and that his country will be pushing for further sanctions to be imposed immediately.“Those who point out that intensive sanctions are needed here and now are right. The impact of the sanctions in the long and medium term is obviously important, but it does not affect Russia’s decisions towards Ukraine here and now,” he said, adding that it’s important to standardize the approach toward Russia within the EU and NATO.Moscow attacked the neighboring state in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia has demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO, while Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.In retaliation for the Russian offensive, multiple Western countries have imposed unprecedented economic sanctions against Russian organizations and individuals."

The operation was just one in a string of illegal NATO invasions which still remain unpunished, says retired UN Independent Expert on the Promotion of a Democratic and Equitable International Order, Alfred-Maurice de Zayas.","Sputnik: You say that no violation of the Nuremberg Principles has been graver than the invasion, occupation and devastation of Iraq in 2003. What do you mean? Alfred de Zayas: It was a veritable revolt against the Nuremberg Principles, international law and the international order, the cumulation of the crimes of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity - and all this with total impunity. The vastness of the operation, the viciousness of the bombardment, the destruction of world heritage sites and museums, the use of white phosphorus and cluster bombs, widespread torture at Abu Ghraib and other prisons including Guantanamo, the “extraordinary rendition” program - all this constituted “shock and awe” upon Iraqi victims, a demonstration of imperial power intended to convince the world of America’s hegemony. Let us not forget that the UN Security Council had been seized of the Iraqi situation since 1991, that there was no reason, no urgency to do anything against the government of Iraq that was already cooperating with the UN. Two United Nations inspectors were performing their job on the ground - systematically searching for weapons of mass destruction - and not finding any. Hans Blix and Mohamed el-Baradei were both threatened by the United States to make a false finding that Saddam Hussein was in “material breach” of the relevant Security Council resolutions. This would have provided an “excuse”, a mantle of legality, for the US to invade Iraq with the blessing of the Security Council. But Blix and el-Baradei never delivered the magic words “material breach”, and the UN had to withdraw its inspectors, because it became apparent that the US would attack with or without approval by the Security Council. The whole operation was criminal and deliberate. It is a disgrace that 90 percent of the West's media supported “shock and awe” and disseminated the fake news and intelligence coming from Washington and London.   Sputnik: According to the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, western media played a great role in whitewashing the illegal US campaign. What's your take on the role western media played in world affairs, given that it still remains mute about eight-year genocide of Russian-speakers in Donbass, and peddling untruthful and distorted narrative of Russia's special operation today? Alfred de Zayas: The western media has been complicit in NATO’s crimes not only in Iraq, but also in Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. Our corporate media (I am an American citizen) engages in flagrant war propaganda and incitement to hatred – in 2003 against Iraq and the Iraqi people who supported Saddam Hussein, and today against Russia and Russians, who are depicted as aggressors and gross violators of human rights. This Russophobic propaganda did not start in 2022 - it has a long history going back to the Fifties and Joe McCarthy, going back to the demonisation of Brezhnev and Andropov, and more recently of Vladimir Putin. They participated in the demonisation of Saddam Hussein and in the hysteria that accompanied the run-up to the invasion, which UN Secretary General Kofi Annan labelled an “illegal war” several times. Our media does not only disseminate “fake news” and bogus arguments, it also suppresses inconvenient facts, including the massive violations of the 2014 and 2015 Minsk Agreements by Ukraine, the savage shelling of Lugansk and Donetsk, the destruction of hospitals and schools. Anyone who wants to be informed about what is happening in Ukraine must also consult RT, Sputnik, CGTN, Asia Times, Telesur, Prensa Latina and “alternative media” such as Greyzone, the Intercept, Consortium News and Counterpunch. Sputnik: Could one qualify NATO as a ""criminal organisation"" for purposes of Article 9 of the Statute of Rome of 8 August 1945 - the statute of the Nuremberg Tribunal? Is there ample evidence and necessary preconditions for it? How could this be done? Alfred de Zayas: I would like to see Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch come out and call a spade a spade. I would like to see the UN Secretary-General, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights engage in more than just “peace” rhetoric, but to formulate an implementable plan that guarantees a security architecture for all countries in Europe and the world. I would like to see the Secretary-General vindicate the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, including the sovereign equality of states and the right of self-determination of all peoples, including the peoples of Crimea and Donbass. It is time to demand an end to impunity for the crime of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is time to demand that the International Court of Justice declare in an Advisory Opinion that the eastern expansion of NATO entailed a “threat to international peace and security” for purposes of article 39 of the UN Charter and constituted a violation of article 2(4) of the Charter, which prohibits not only the use of force but also the threat of the use of force. How else can we describe the continuous expansion of NATO in violation of the assurances given to Gorbachev in 1989, 1990 and 1991? How else can we describe the massive rearmament of Ukraine with only one purpose – to intimidate Russia? NATO is certainly not a “defensive alliance” – at least not since the Warsaw Pact was dissolved in 1991. NATO has been trying to usurp the role of the UN Security Council, which has exclusive responsibility for keeping peace and security in the world. Of course, since the Security Council will never agree to impose a “Pax Americana” on the rest of the world, NATO unilaterally assumes the role of imperial policeman over the globe and establishes hundreds of military bases intended to encircle not only Russia, but China as well. An Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice could look into the question whether the number and magnitude of these crimes qualify NATO as a “criminal organisation” for purposes of Article 9 of the London Agreement of 8 August 1945.  Of course, there are serious problems with the concept of a “criminal organisation”, because we all believe in individual justice and not in guilt by association. It would be necessary to ensure the presumption of innocence of all members of a “criminal organisation” and guarantee due process as provided for in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. But questions concerning the crimes committed by NATO and NATO countries must be raised. Bearing in mind that NATO has such a long track record of war crimes and crimes against humanity, it is important that history record this sad reality, and that civil society the world over reject the propaganda narratives and demand more transparency and accountability from the leaders of the US and all NATO countries. Here is a task for the International Criminal Court – to examine whether the violations of Articles 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Statute of Rome by NATO countries justify calling NATO a “criminal organisation"". Bottom line: International law is by definition universal, and it must be enforced not only against little countries, but against all members of the international community, objectively and without double-standards.

Moscow has seen thousands of harsh new curbs and sanctions slapped on it as a result, with the US, the EU, and others seeking to “isolate” and “destroy” the Russian economy."

The Fund has significant financial resources of at least $2.4 billion.It was not immediately clear which company Kirillov was specifically referring to because Rosemont Seneca is a decentralized investment fund, comprised of several entities sharing similar names. President Joe Biden’s youngest son Hunter headed the now-defunct DC-based Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, but his legal team has denied his involvement with other branches of the fund, namely the Delaware-based Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC.The Rosemont Seneca fund is closely affiliated with top Pentagon contractors, Kirillov explained, explicitly naming Metabiota, as well as the Black and Veach companies he described as “the main supplier of equipment for Pentagon biolaboratories around the world.”The latter concern has been named as a contractor in a 2015 deal between the US government and Ukraine, publicized by the Russian military during the briefing.According to the document, a nearly $32-million program was aimed at “organizing work of the laboratories, built and modernized with the help of the donor [the US government],” as well as “monitoring infectious diseases” and conducting work to “react rapidly” to outbreaks. The program also listed the “safe collection, processing, temporary storage and transportation of clinical samples” as its goals.The Ukrainian biolaboratories network has been funded by other US agencies as well, Kirillov said, describing the scale of the biolabs program as an “impressive” one.“Apart from the military, the US Agency for International Development, the George Soros Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are directly involved in its implementation. Scientific supervision is carried out by leading research organizations, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which develops nuclear weapons,” the official said.Moscow sound the alarm about questionable US-sponsored pharmaceutical and biological research taking place in secretive laboratories scattered across Ukraine after it attacked its neighbor, last month. The military offensive came following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

Stop sending arms to Ukraine… You’re going to push us to World War III.”Canada, which along with the US and other Western nations backs Ukraine in the ongoing conflict, has sent so many rocket launchers, grenades, and other equipment to Kiev that it has “exhausted” its own military’s stockpile of weapons, Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand said last week.Today I interrupted foreign minister ⁦@melaniejoly⁩ to challenge Canada’s escalation of violence in Ukraine, weapons deliveries & NATO. pic.twitter.com/1Glb0kdfpz“Why didn’t you push Kiev to sign the Minsk accords?” Engler asked, addressing Joly.The Minsk agreements, which were signed with the mediation of Russia, Germany, and France in 2014, were designed to regulate the status of the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as part of Ukraine.However, shortly before Russia launched its military operation in February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the accords “incompetent” and made it clear that Kiev wasn’t going to fulfill them.“Stop using Ukraine as a proxy against Russia,” the author said, repeating some of his statements in French and then managing to flee the room before security could apprehend him.In an article published on his website on Monday, Engler condemned the Russian attack on Ukraine, but pointed out that NATO’s eastward expansion had increased the likelihood of an armed conflict between the two nations. A declaration of Ukraine as a neutral state which will never join the US-led military bloc has been one of Moscow’s key demands during the ongoing peace talks with Kiev.“Peace minded Canadians should redouble our efforts to get Canada out of NATO,” he said.Engler, who is the author of a dozen books, also actively protested the involvement of Canada in the coup in Haiti in 2004. At the time, he crashed a press conference by then-Canadian Foreign Minister Pierre Pettigrew and poured cranberry juice on him, symbolizing the blood of the Haitian people.He is also a strong supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign, which calls for measures against Israel over its occupation of Palestinian lands."

It is not yet known what amount the vouchers would be for, which products they would cover, how exactly they would be distributed and who would be eligible for them.Russia and Ukraine are among the world’s biggest crop suppliers. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the two countries represent 53% of global trade in sunflower oil and seeds and 27% in wheat. The European Central Bank had earlier said that food inflation “is expected to remain high throughout 2022” due to high commodity prices and “extraordinary increases” in gas and electricity prices. The European Commission is currently working on measures which could increase the EU’s food security.However, as UNCTAD warns, all countries will inevitably be impacted by the conflict-generated crisis. Increases in food and fuel prices “will affect the most vulnerable in developing countries, putting pressure on the poorest households which spend the highest share of their income on food, resulting in hardship and hunger,” the organization warned.Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

The island’s currently leaders are vehemently opposed to the idea.,"Only one third of the Taiwan’s residents believe the United States military would assist in the island’s defence in the event of a “Chinese invasion,” a new poll by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation has found. The figures mark a dramatic decline in confidence in a US military intervention, with a similar survey taken in October 2021 finding that 65 percent of respondents believed the US would intervene. 78 percent of respondents in the new poll think Taiwan had no chance of withstanding a Chinese incursion independently, but three quarters of those questioned nevertheless approve prolonging Taiwan’s conscription period beyond the present four months. The polling was conducted 14-15 March, with 1,077 people aged 20 and above surveyed, with an estimated margin of error of 2.99 percent. In mid-2021, a Chicago Council Survey found that 53 percent of Americans were in favour of a formal military alliance with Taiwan. 52 percent also supported using the US military to assist the island’s defence forces at the time. Earlier this month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated China’s position that Taiwan was an “inalienable part of Chinese territory,” and expressed confidence that the island would “eventually return to the embrace of the motherland.” The current Taiwanese government and its US allies have repeatedly accused the People’s Republic of having aggressive designs to “invade” and “conquer” the island. However, Chinese officials have insisted that the process will be peaceful. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that “to achieve the reunification of the motherland by peaceful means” was “most in line with the overall interests of the Chinese nation, including our compatriots in Taiwan.” Taiwan, which formally calls itself the ‘Republic of China’, broke off from the mainland in 1949 after the victory of communist forces in the Chinese Civil War. Beijing and Taipei spent the next several decades bickering over which of them has is the one true China. The United Nations formally recognized the PRC as such in 1971, with the United States moving to recognize the People’s Republic in 1979, while maintaining a close partnership with Taiwan. In the 1980s and 1990s, Taiwan’s longtime ruling party – the nationalist Kuomintang – the same political force that fought the communists during the civil war, worked to improve economic and informal diplomatic links with the PRC. More recently, some of its factions have also expressed support for reunification under the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle. However, the current ruling party – the Democratic Progressives, is openly hostile to any form of reunification, and has lobbied Washington extensively to shore up diplomatic ties and military assistance.

","The West should supply Turkey with F-35 fighters and Patriot missile systems without preconditions, the head of the Communications Department of the Turkish presidential Administration, Fahrettin Altun, said. He added that any ""informal proposals"" would not help to repair relations.  Earlier this month, Reuters reported, citing its sources, that the US had informally discussed with Turkey the possibility of sending Russian S-400 defence systems to Ukraine to help it in fighting against the Russian army. In response to the report, Altun wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, saying that the idea of Ankara handing over the S-400s it acquired from Russia to Ukraine is unrealistic.  ""Though quite unrealistic today, this idea presents an opportunity to discuss the problems Turkey has experienced lately with the West,"" Altun said. The official also emphasised that before buying S-400s from Russia, Turkey had repeatedly approached the US for the purchase of the Patriot system.  ""Given that Turkey is in one of the world’s most dangerous and unstable regions, and the threats Turkey faced did not magically disappear with Washington’s rejection, Ankara had to look into alternatives...Turkey did not have the choice to buy the Patriot,"" Altun explained. The relations between Turkey and the US became strained several years ago, after Ankara signed a contract with Moscow in 2017 for the supply of Russian-made S-400 air defence systems. Washington then suspended Turkey from its F-35 programme, although Ankara had previously paid for the delivery of the fifth generation fighter jets. The US claimed that Russian S-400s were incompatible with NATO's military hardware and would pose a threat to the bloc. Turkey refused to cancel the contract on S-400s, arguing that it has the right to strengthen its defence in the way it sees necessary. This comes amid continuing attempts by the US to pressure Turkey to impose sanctions against Russia over its special military operation in Ukraine. However, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has repeatedly said that Ankara has no intention to join international sanctions against Russia and is only ready to act as a mediator in negotiations between Moscow and Kiev.

Dubbed the 'Doomsday' plane, it was dispatched by the US Air Force to Europe as part of a fleet of jets supporting President Joe Biden throughout his four-day agenda, including an emergency NATO summit, a G7 summit and a meeting of the European Council in Brussels. Washington and its allies have been developing plans for additional forces and capabilities to prop up defence in Ukraine, where Russia is conducting its special operation to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" the country, launched on 24 February. Moscow took the decision after the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for assistance amid increasing attacks from Kiev forces. The Kremlin has underscored that the goal of its operation is to exclusively target military infrastructure of the country, while having no plans of occupying Ukraine. The E4-B Nightwatch - based on a Boeing 747 – is outwardly similar to the American presidential aircraft, known as Air Force One. It is part of a fleet of four  jets that first entered service in the 1980s and have been upgraded since their first deployment. Dubbed the “Flying Pentagon”, they are designed to be a command and control centre in the event of nuclear war as they can survive the electromagnetic pulse that is released when a nuclear charge detonates. Furthermore, the jets can maintain contact with US military units across the globe as orders from the POTUS are conveyed to US nuclear submarines and Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos. News of the deployment of Joe Biden’s “Doomsday” plane to Europe comes against the backdrop of reports that his administration has assembled a team of national security officials to draw scenarios for how the US would respond to a chemical, biological, or nuclear weapon attack by Russia during its operation in Ukraine. The New York Times had cited sources within the discussions, claiming a group dubbed “Tiger Team” was established in a memo signed by the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, on 28 February, four days after Moscow began the special military operation. While the report claimed that the Tiger Team was tasked with examining what might compel the NATO alliance to deploy military force in Ukraine, Biden himself has openly voiced his opposition to such an eventuality. The US President has emphasized that a direct involvement in ongoing conflict would be ""World War 3."" Indeed, Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin had ordered that the country’s nuclear forces be placed on heightened alert late last month, citing ""aggressive statements"" by British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss about possible NATO involvement in the Ukraine crisis. Truss had remarked that the crisis in Ukraine “could end up” being a conflict between the “freedom and democracy”-loving nations of the Western alliance and Russia. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan made mention of that, ahead of Joe Biden’s trip to Europe, saying that the White House would discuss potential use of nuclear weapons with allies and partners in the context of the developments in Ukraine. In response to the West’s talk of Russia’s potential use of nuclear weapons, Moscow has clarified that only if it determined its existence as a nation was threatened would it resort to such a scenario. ""We have a concept of domestic security, it's public, you can read all the reasons for [Russia's] nuclear arms to be used. If it is an existential threat for our country, then it can be used in accordance with our concept,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN in an interview.

Naumova recalls her time at the US Arnold Classic championship in 2015, when she won and met Schwarzenegger, whom she called her ""idol"". She said she handed him letters from children in Donbass that the kids gave her when she was visiting the region on a humanitarian sports mission. At the time, according the powerlifting champion, Schwarzenegger said that he would ""work on"" the letters, before handing the envelope to his assistant. The athlete drew Schwarzenegger's attention to a gloomy memorial in Donetsk known as the Alley of Angels, established in memory of children ""killed by bullets and bombs of the Ukrainian army"". Her response comes days after the former California governor released his own message addressed to the Russian people. In a nine-minute-long video posted on his social media, Schwarzenegger assured Russians that he ""loves"" them and told viewers about his own Russian icon, powerlifting champion Yuri Vlasov.  The ""Terminator"" star said he wanted to spread the ""truth"" about the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine, which he described as an ""illegal war"" that he believed was not launched in the name of the Russian people. He then recalled the Nazi past of his father, who ""did not like Russians"" after his experience during World War II. Drawing a parallel between his father's time in the Nazi army and Russian soldiers, Schwarzenegger addressed the latter, noting that his father was traumatised by war wounds and a sense of guilt. The military operation in Ukraine, which has been ongoing for over 20 days, was launched by the Kremlin in late February with the goal to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" the neighbouring country. Moscow said it had no plans to occupy Ukraine or harm civilians, underlining that Russian troops only target military infrastructure. Western countries, however, have condemned the military operation and called it an invasion, imposing a slew of harsh anti-Russian sanctions that have targeted the Russian economy, media, culture, sports, and many other spheres.

Despite the incumbent President still enjoying a margin of victory over the head of the right-wing National Rally party, Macron would win by just 53 percent versus 47 percent for Le Pen, if the two were to face off in the second round, shows a poll by the Ifop-Fiducial group published on 29 March. In a similar positioning, a poll by Ipsos Sopra-Steria showed Macron winning by 56 percent to 44 percent against le Pen. The shift in momentum was dismissed by the French president’s aides as no more than a mere correction after an initial surge in support for Macron over his stance on the Ukraine developments.  Nevertheless, Le Pen and her National Rally party have received the boost in support cited by polls as between a quarter and a third of voters reportedly remain undecided on who to cast their ballots for. “I have never been so close to victory,” Le Pen, who has been focusing on domestic issues such as inflation and cost of living during her campaign, told Le Parisien newspaper in an interview published Saturday. Marine Le Pen has also weighed in on the developments in Ukraine, where Russia has been conducting a special operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify the country. Denouncing arms supplies to Kiev by the West as verging on participation in the ongoing conflict, Le Pen also told BFM TV that a war with Russia would be of ""high intensity"", and she would not want France to take part in such a war. ""The best way to help Ukrainians is to achieve peace"", she stressed. Furthermore, the anti-Russian sanctions that Western countries have slapped on Moscow would make the French people ""the first victims,"" according to Le Pen, particularly an embargo on Russian gas and oil. Meanwhile, Emmanuel Macron, 44, has engaged in a flurry of diplomatic meetings prompted by the developments in Ukraine, Last week saw Macron, hoping to be the first French president to win re-election in 20 years, attend NATO, G7 and European summits. His opponents have accused him of using the international developments as a means of dodging the political debate on the home front, failing to step up on such issues as immigration, crime and defending French culture. Slammed by them as a “president of the rich,” the former investment banker sought to boost his canvassing at home this week. He ventured out on a public walkabout to meet voters on Monday in the town of Dijon, where he was given an earful by voters, complaining of inflation and rocketing fuel prices – issues that have all been exacerbated by fallout from the Ukraine crisis. After Russia began a military operation in Ukraine responding to calls for help from the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, which it had earlier formally recognized, the West responded by imposing comprehensive sanctions against Moscow, prompting many foreign companies to suspend operations in the country. The Western sanctions have had a massive impact on food and energy prices and supplies worldwide. Emmanuel Macron, who only officially declared his candidacy earlier this month, 24 hours before a deadline for candidates to finalise their intent to run, when accosted by voters in Dijon responded by saying: A total of 12 candidates succeeded in gathering the 500 endorsements from elected French officials required to enter the presidential race, with the top two in the first round facing off in a second-round run-off on April 24.

They simply don’t understand President Putin, don’t understand the decision-making mechanism, and don’t understand the work we do,” he said.According to the spokesperson: “It’s not only regrettable, but also raises concerns because such lack of understanding leads to wrong, rash decisions with bad consequences.” The comment came after Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday that Putin “has not been fully informed by his Ministry of Defense at every turn over the last month.” He said the information has been gathered through intelligence.A similar claim was made by White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield.“We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military, which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership,” she said during a press briefing. Bedingfield also stated that advisers were “too afraid to tell him the truth.”Commenting on the Russian campaign in Ukraine, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said on Tuesday that “the main goals of the first stage of the operation have generally been accomplished.”Moscow attacked the neighboring state in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

Additionally, Treasury staff frequently provide technical assistance on sanctions bills,"" a US Treasury official told Axios. According to the media, the legislation would deter the purchase of Russian gold by applying secondary sanctions to any American entities that transport or make transactions with Russian gold. On 24 February, Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine in response to calls from the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics to protect them from intensifying attacks by Ukrainian troops. The Russian Defence Ministry said the special operation is targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure and the civilian population is not in danger. The United States and its allies have responded by imposing comprehensive sanctions against Russia. "

","The current Russophobia in the West is a verdict on Western civilisation, Russian Foreign Minister Segey Lavrov said in his address to students at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.  Speaking about the priorities of Russian foreign policy in view of the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, Lavrov said that the prompt conclusion of Russia-Ukraine negotiations is not beneficial for the United States. According to him, Washington wants hostilities between Russia and Ukraine to continue as long as possible. He stressed that Russia is not against Western mediation in talks with Ukraine but there are certainly some red lines that should not be crossed.   When asked about the possibility of peacekeepers being deployed to Ukraine, the minister said that this could lead to a clash between Russian and NATO forces. Commenting on the unprecedented sanctions imposed by the West on Russia after the beginning of the operation in Ukraine, Lavrov said these restrictions are aimed at removing Russia as an obstacle to a unipolar world. According to the minister, the freezing of the Russian central bank's reserves by the West is 'just theft'.  Going back to the major goals of the Russian special operation in Ukraine, Lavrov said that concerns Moscow had about Kiev preparing an offensive in the Donbass region have proved reasonable. Moscow will demand that Ukraine cancel legislation directed against the Russian-speaking population of the country, the Russian Foreign Minister added. He noted that under the presidency of Volodymyr Zelensky, all attempts to re-introduce Russian as a second official language in regions where it is spoken were shot down by lawmakers. "

The Turkish president was referring to a Wall Street Journal op-ed penned by Fahrettin Altun, the head of the Communications Department  of the Turkish presidential Administration, who reckoned that the idea of handing over the air defence systems Ankara purchased from Russia to Ukraine was ""unrealistic"". Instead, Altun argued that the West should supply Turkey with F-35 fighter jets and Patriot missile systems without preconditions to help mend ties. Aside from clarifying his stance on the S-400 idea, Erdogan told reporters that he was planning to talk to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, at the end of the week in order to discuss the outcome of the NATO summit in Brussels held this week. The Turkish president made it clear that Ankara will not be joining its NATO allies in imposing sanctions against Moscow, especially when it comes to the energy needs. ""We are also evaluating certain UN lines in terms of sanctions, but let's not forget that we cannot put aside our relations with Russia,"" the Turkish leader told reporters on the plane upon his return from Brussels. ""There are discussions about carrying out transactions in rubles, that is, in their own national currency. We have already proposed this to Russia, we have said that it is possible to do this in rubles and Turkish lira. Now we are completely proven right, and they say that they can do it,"" Hurriyet quoted Erdogan as saying on Friday. Last week, Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said that even though Turkey understood the position of its allies regarding Russia, Ankara believed it should maintain an open line of communication with Moscow. On 23 March, President Vladimir Putin said that Russia will be transferring payments for gas supplies to ""unfriendly countries"" into rubles, pointing out that it makes no sense to supply Russian goods to the EU and the US and receive payment in their currency. Putin instructed the Central Bank and the Cabinet of Ministers to determine the procedure for transactions with Europe in rubles within a week. At the same time, he said that Russia would continue to supply gas in volumes and at prices fixed in earlier contracts, as the country values its reputation. A number of Western countries introduced several batches of sanctions against Russia over its military operation in Ukraine. Even though Moscow admitted that the sanctions are quite crippling, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed that Russia had been preparing for them in advance. President Putin said that the policy of containing and weakening Russia is a long-term strategy of the West, and sanctions have dealt a serious blow to the entire global economy. Putin also said that the United States and the European Union had effectively defaulted on their obligations to Russia, freezing its foreign exchange reserves. He added that current events draw a line under the global dominance of the West in both politics and economics. Russia launched a special military operation to demilitarise and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine on 24 February in order to protect the Donbass population. Putin stressed that he made the tough decision after the newly recognised Donetsk and Lugansk republics appealed for help.  "

According to media reports, the meeting between the politicians lasted roughly 30 minutes.The encounter came hours after Andriy Yermak, a senior aide to the Ukrainian president, lamented the apparent lack of support on the part of NATO. In an interview with the arms contractor-funded Atlantic Council lobby group, he accused the alliance of “taking decisions as if there [were] no war.”On Friday, Russia’s military released a statement claiming the first stage of Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine had been successfully completed, and that the offensive was going to plan."

The two sides were also said to have discussed the implementation of the programme for expanded cooperation set by President Putin and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi during the latter's visit to Moscow in January. Lavrov and Abdollahian met on the sidelines of an upcoming conference of senior officials from Russia, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan chaired by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to discuss the security and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan in the aftermath of the US withdrawal last August. Diplomats from Indonesia and Qatar are also expected to attend. Asking Lavrov to convey President Raisi's ""warm greetings"" to Putin, Abdollahian said that ""bileteral relations between Russia and Iran are on the right track and developing."" ""I was informed that positive steps are planned in the course of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine,"" the Iranian foreign minister added. Moscow considers sanctions an instrument of Western policy aimed at ""undermining the principle of the sovereign equality of states,"" and an attempt to ""revise"" the UN Charter, Lavrov added. Russia rocketed past Iran to become the world's most heavily-sanctioned nation in recent weeks, with a total of over 5,200 sanctions placed on Moscow to date, compared with 3,600 for the Islamic Republic, according to sanctions tracking service Castellum.ai. The sanctions have trapped some $300 billion in Russian foreign exchange reserves abroad, and left Russian businesses scrambling to find alternatives to Western-sourced machinery and equipment, spare parts, services, and consumer goods. Iran has faced varying degrees of sanctions pressure since the Revolution of 1979, but instead of allowing the restrictions to drag it down, has used them to its advantage to become the largest industrial power in the Middle East, and to develop a host of economic sectors ranging from defence electronics to aerospace from scratch.

The Russian Defence Ministry, in turn, underlined that the country’s armed forces are only targeting Ukraine's military infrastructure with high-precision weapons and that Ukrainian civilians are not in danger.

Tod Wolters, commander of US European Command. Wolters acknowledged this at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, sharing his ""suspicion” of a need for a bulked-up US military presence, while declining to specify whether that would mean permanent basing. Wolters was responding to a question from Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who asked whether the United States ought to station more troops permanently in Europe, particularly in the Baltics, instead of the current practice of employing rotating forces. Under the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation, signed in Paris, France, in 1997, the alliance would not undertake any “additional permanent stationing of substantial combat forces” in the east of Europe, well as from placing nuclear weapons in the region. However, in recent months, amid Russia’s operation in Ukraine,  started after the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for help due to increasing attacks from Kiev forces, US military forces under Wolters' command have grown from about 60,000 to 102,000 as of Tuesday, confirmed the general. On 28 March, the Pentagon announced the deployment of six Navy EA-18G Growlers electronic attack aircraft, accompanied by about 240 troops, to Germany. This comes as earlier this year an armored brigade of the 1st Infantry Division, totaling about 4,000 soldiers, was sent to Germany, a similar-size infantry brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division was dispatched to Poland. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also sent F-35A fifth-generation stealth fighter jets to bolster NATO’s “Eastern Flank” and as many as twenty Apache attack helicopters to the Baltic States. All of these reinforcements have been billed as temporary, with American military and administration officials assuring that no US troops would enter Ukraine. When recent remarks by US President Joe Biden in Poland were interpreted by many as a hint at a potential deployment of US forces to Ukraine, Gen. Tod Wolters was forced to deny some of the dubious claims made by the POTUS. Thus, at Tuesday’s US Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Wolters dismissed claims that Americans are training Ukrainian troops in Poland. ""I do not believe that we are in the process of currently training military forces from Ukraine in Poland"", stated the European Command (EUCOM) head. He confirmed there are ""liaisons that are there"", and ""they're being given advice, and that’s different"". Currently, there are over 10,000 American troops stationed in Poland. Wolters' comments followed President Biden's remarks in Poland on Monday, when POTUS responded to a reporter's question about his comments, made when meeting paratroopers from the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division last week in Poland. At the time, in an apparent gaffe, Biden had implied that US forces would be going to Ukraine. At Monday's press conference, in an attempt to double back, the American President denied he had meant that, saying that he was ""referring to being with, and talking with, the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland"". US troop deployments to Eastern Europe come as earlier in the month, during a testimony before a House committee just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of the special military operation in Ukraine, a senior official who oversaw the 2021 Pentagon review of its worldwide military presence warned it needed to be reconsidered. Mara Karlin had stated on 1 March that the Pentagon must “ensure that we've got deterrence of Russia and that we can absolutely 150% say that NATO is safe and secure,” not only in connection with the developments in Ukraine, but “for the longer term.” Let's stay in touch no matter what!

The paper also pointed out that India’s government has maintained a neutral policy toward the war thus far – and a Twitter spokeswoman claimed the company was still investigating.The platform acknowledged in a recent blog post that it has deleted 75,000 accounts for violation of its “platform manipulation and spam policy” since the war in Ukraine began. Those accounts are not thought to “represent a specific, coordinated campaign associated with a government actor.”Jones highlighted alleged “suspicious behavior” among those Indian accounts promoting the Russian government’s view on the war, including accounts using stock photos in profiles and gaining plentiful likes and retweets despite few followers. The profiles had also used the #IStandWithPutin hashtag.It’s unclear how many of the accounts belonged to real people, but some of them most likely were real, Jones said.“If you can get enough people spreading a message, then real people will join in,” he told the Times.Brookie noted the “longstanding and deep security and economic relations” between India and Russia, saying Moscow would be “looking to countries like India” to abstain from international efforts to isolate it.After an Indian student was killed in Ukraine during the fighting earlier this month, some of the 20,000 Indian citizens struggling to escape were reportedly subjected to racism, as Ukrainians at the border refused to allow them on trains and buses headed for safety, telling them they would have to walk – reports that may have added fuel to anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russian sentiment in the country.Hundreds of Indians belonging to an organization called the Hindu Sena marched in New Delhi earlier this month, chanting messages of support for Russia. The country continues to purchase most of its weapons from Russia, giving its government little reason to torpedo a mutually beneficial relationship.India is not the only place where Twitter has nuked accounts for alleged inauthentic posting. In the months preceding the 2020 US election, for example, Facebook removed over 10,000 accounts and pages from 13 countries – including a multitude of then-president Donald Trump’s supporters – for just such behavior. Facebook (now Meta), Twitter, and other major social media platforms have long worked hand in hand with highly politicized think tanks like the Atlantic Council, and Western news agencies, to help them fight “disinformation” online during elections and times of political upheaval."

They need our help,” Portman said, explaining the need for the legislation.Almost 3.9 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched its military operation in the country a month ago, according to the UN.“Our bill makes [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and Russian oligarchs pay the price by ensuring that funds from their seized assets go directly to the Ukrainian people to support them through the many difficult years ahead of resettlement, reconstruction, and recovery,” Bennet said.Washington’s response to Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine has included a freeze on the reserves of the central bank, which Russia has decried as “theft,” and a ban on oil imports from the country.Russia sent its troops into Ukraine on February 24, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.Moscow has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the Donbass by force."

The statement came amid the ongoing Russian special military operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine.","UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made it clear that China should get off the political fence and condemn Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine. According to Johnson, ""there are considerable dilemmas now for people who thought they could sit this one out, who thought they could sit on the fence"". Referring to the neutral stance adopted by China following the beginning of Russia's special operation in Ukraine, the PM said that he believes ""in Beijing you are starting to see some second thoughts"" on the matter. The remarks followed Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian responding to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's warning that Beijing will face consequences for supporting the Russian operation in Ukraine. He added that some in the US continue to spread false information and slander, trying to pressure China, something that Zhao said is extremely irresponsible behaviour that does not help resolve the Ukraine crisis. This came after the Chinese diplomat emphasised earlier this week that Beijing will continue to pursue normal trade and economic cooperation with Moscow based on mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit. He also said that Beijing calls on Washington to avoid damaging China's interests when trying to settle its relations with Russia.  Additionally, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that ""Beijing discourages the use of sanctions to settle problems and even more opposes unilateral sanctions that lack international legal grounds"". The comments were preceded by US State Department spokesman Ned Price raising concerns over alleged attempts by China to use the Ukrainian crisis ""to advance Beijing's long-term interest in its competition with the United States"". He also warned Beijing that any support extended to Russia, including ""helping to avert sanctions imposed by the US and its allies, would have implications not only for China's relations with the United States, but for its relationships around the world"". The developments unfold against the backdrop of the ongoing Russian special operation in Ukraine announced by President Vladimir Putin on 24 February to demilitarise and de-Nazify the country. The operation was launched after the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) asked for assistance to defend themselves from intensifying attacks by Ukrainian troops. Putin stressed that Russia is not seeking to occupy Ukraine, while the Russian Defence Ministry underscored that the goal of the operation is to neutralise Ukraine's military capacity with high-precision weapon strikes, which do not pose a threat to the civilian population. In response, the United States, Britain, and the European Union, as well as several other countries, introduced packages of sanctions targeting Russian entities and individuals. Moscow then retaliated with personal sanctions of its own, directed at top US government officials, including President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, as well as Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, who have been added to Russia's own ""stop list"".

The UN has called to thoroughly investigate such incidents in Ukraine.","Russian President Vladimir Putin called German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's attention to rocket strikes by the Ukrainian military of the cities of Donetsk and Makeevka during a Friday telephone call, the Kremlin press service has stated. The president stressed that these strikes amount to ""war crimes"", but were still completely ignored by the West. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also addressed recent claims by US President Biden, who called Putin a ""murderous dictator"", a ""pure thug"", and a ""war criminal"" in his latest speeches, saying that his statements had already turned into daily insults. Peskov added that such statements should be unacceptable for a president of a country that has killed hundreds of thousands around the world with its bombs. Russia and Ukraine mutually accuse each other's military of attacking civilian objects. The Kremlin has repeatedly guaranteed that Russian forces are only conducting strikes against military objects. The Ukrainian armed forces and nationalist battalions have been carrying out occasional attacks against the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) ever since they declared independence following the West-backed coup in Kiev in 2014. The latest major strike came on 14 March, when a Tochka-U (NATO reporting name is SS-21 Scarab) missile hit the centre of Donetsk, killing 20 and injuring 35 more. The DPR authorities claim that the missile was armed with forbidden cluster munition. The Russian envoy to the UN slammed the strike as a terrorist attack and a war crime. In his conversation with Olaf Scholz, Putin touched upon the ongoing Russia-Ukraine talks, saying that Kiev is trying to drag out the negotiations by making more and more unrealistic proposals. He added that Russia nonetheless continues to search for solutions to negotiate a deal to end the hostilities. Peskov said that the text of an agreement is yet to be negotiated and added that the Russian delegation is ready to work at a faster pace. He expressed regret that the Ukrainian side does not show a similar intent. Let's stay in touch no matter what! Follow our Telegram channel to get all the latest news: https://t.me/sputniknewsus "

Last week, the Russian military estimated that about 6,600 foreign “mercenaries and terrorists” remain active in Ukraine, and that their ranks are dwindling.","Henry Hoeft, the 28-year-old US Army veteran who garnered significant media attention following the release of a viral video detailing his escape from Ukraine after being left without weapons and threatened with execution, has provided new information on his experiences, including possible war crimes carried out by Ukrainian forces and the so-called Georgian Legion, the group of fighters he joined. Speaking to The Grayzone and providing access to a recent interview he did with British media, Hoeft said he joined the infamous Georgian Legion instead of the better-known Ukrainian Foreign Legion because the latter required a contract. Hoeft recalled witnessing how two apparent civilians attempting to pass through a Ukrainian checkpoint, only to be “blackbagged,” taken to a building to have their throats cut. “We don’t even know if they were actually spies or just people who ran through a checkpoint,” he said. Hoeft, who has faced attacks from the Ukrainian government painting him as a Russian stooge, and story after-sarcastically-titled story from Rolling Stone, the Daily Mail and New York Magazine painting him as a coward, stood by sentiments he expressed in his viral video, including about the danger of being shot in the back by your own side. “There’s no such thing as glory in death. You’re going to die in a trench and you’re going to get left there and it’s gross and it’s bad,” Hoeft said. The volunteer said he and his friends decided that they would not go to Kiev unless they were armed first. “You can be ambushed on your way to Kiev [and] that’s it,” he said. Hoeft speculated on why the foreign volunteers were not properly equipped, saying most of the hundreds of millions of dollars in Western equipment that has been sent to Kiev probably ended up in the hands of the Ukrainian army. “They want to keep the casualties of their people to a minimum. So if you have a bunch of foreigners that come to volunteer, send them first.” The American also recalled an incident of a Ukrainian soldier informing him and his comrades that the Georgians were upset at the group’s refusal to go to Kiev without proper weapons, and warning that the Legion’s fighters were “threatening to shoot you in the back.” He said he and his group ultimately decided to leave Ukraine and cross back into Poland after being told that the legion planned to have them executed and marked down as combat casualties. On their way back, Hoeft’s group met British fighters who said volunteers in combat gear were being sent back from the border area after having their passports confiscated. Hoeft gave a warning to any Americans, including combat veterans from conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan, to stay home, saying the situation in Ukraine was unlike anything the US has seen since Vietnam, and possibly worse. Russian airstrikes against training camps hosting volunteers and the testimony of people like Hoeft and other Westerners have reportedly led to a thinning out of the numbers of foreigners seeking to ‘fight Russia’ in Ukraine. Last week, Russian General Staff Main Operational Directorate chief Sergei Rudskoy said in a briefing that Russia had picked up on the presence of 6,595 foreign ""mercenaries and terrorists"" from 62 countries operating in Ukraine. Pointing to their dwindling numbers, particularly after the missile strike on the Yavoriv training base on 13 March, Rudskoy warned that the rules of warfare do not apply to mercenaries. "

According to Zelensky, the activities of the opposition parties will be put on hold “for the period of martial law.”“Any activity of politicians aimed at division and collaboration won’t be successful, but will instead be faced with a harsh response,” the president warned.A total of 11 parties were blacklisted, including Opposition Platform – For Life, which is the second-biggest in the Verkhovna Rada with 39 seats; Party of Shariy, founded by harsh critic of the Kiev authorities, blogger Anatoly Shariy; and Nashi party, headed by Evgeniy Murayev.In January, the UK Foreign Office said that Murayev was the man whom the Kremlin wanted to put in charge of Ukraine instead of Zelensky. However, the claim was denied by officials in Moscow and the politician himself, who said it was “nonsense and stupidity.”Opposition Platform – For Life said the suspension was “illegal” and promised to challenge it. “Instead of political dialogue [and] attempts to search for compromise and ways to unite the country, the authorities are relying on raiding, intimidation, repression and reprisals against their opponents,” the party said, urging its MPs and activists to continue working.Shariy reacted by suggesting that Zelensky was only really looking to ban two parties – allegedly referring to his own and to Opposition Platform – while the rest were only added to the list so that the president could avoid “criticism and mockery” for blatantly targeting his opponents.Russia sent its troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the breakaway Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Moscow has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."

Earlier, Ukraine had asked Nepal to ban Russian mountaineering teams from the country “until the end of the Russian invasion.”“There has been no change in our policy so far,” Taranath Adhikari, the director of Nepal's tourism department, told the BBC. “We believe our mountains are global assets and any countries’ citizens willing to visit them for attainment of peace should be allowed to do so – as long as they do it within our legal provisions,” he added.In a letter to the Nepalese government last week, Ukraine’s embassy to India and Nepal in New Delhi noted that Russian athletes have already been banned from the International Olympic Committee and “many other” world sporting organizations. Ukraine embassy in India requests Nepal to ban on Russian climbers until the end of the Russian invasion. Will Nepal's tourism ministry announce ban on Russian mountaineering teams? pic.twitter.com/KyY4N56YHY“Taking into consideration the above, the esteemed Nepalese side is kindly requested to ban Russian mountaineering teams until the end of [the] Russian invasion into Ukraine,” the letter reads, with the original copy capitalizing the name of every country involved except Russia. The flying of a Russian flag over Nepal’s mountains, the letter concludes, is a “matter of deep moral concern.”However, in addition to Adhikari’s announcement, officials at Nepal’s embassy in New Delhi told the BBC that they “received no communication” regarding Ukraine’s request. According to the BBC, nine Russian climbers have already received permits to climb in Nepal this spring season. One has been permitted to climb Annapurna I (8,091 meters), while eight others have been cleared to scale peaks below 6,500 meters.“We are professional operators, and we serve our clients irrespective of their nationalities,” Expedition Operators Association of Nepal President Dambar Parajuli told the BBC.In addition to the sporting bans, Russians have recently seen their shops and restaurants vandalized in multiple western cities, their assets seized in the UK, and their compatriots ostracized from the worlds of classical music and high culture. Russian President Vladimir Putin last week accused Western elites of “trying to cancel the whole of our thousand-year-old country, our people.” Earlier this month, the Russian Foreign Ministry said it was taking note of “the unprecedented level of Russophobia” and that “those responsible will be brought to responsibility in accordance with the current law.”Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.The German- and French-brokered protocol had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO.

French President Emmanuel Macron called for restraint in both actions and words when it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, saying he personally “would not use that kind of comment.”It was only the latest in a line of several harsh statements by Biden aimed at Putin personally. Earlier this month, Biden referred to the Russian leader as a “war criminal,” a “murderous dictator,” “a pure thug” and “a butcher.” In response, the Kremlin warned that relations between Moscow and Washington were “on the brink of collapse.”Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two Donbass republics by force."

The lawsuit says that ""acting in concert, the defendants maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that their Republican opponent Donald J. Trump was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty.""","""The timing seems wise as the lawsuit begins while Americans remain engaged considering events rather than during the summer when many are more interested in trying to enjoy time off from working. Now through November 2022, we will have plenty of time to evaluate claims and counterclaims, assuming the judge (a Bill Clinton nominee) does not dismiss Trump's lawsuit,"" says Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst and investigative journalist. The ex-president's lawsuit is targeting Clinton, her 2016 presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee, DNC-linked law firm Perkins Coie, former Clinton campaign lawyers Michael Sussmann and Marc Elias, Biden National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, ex-Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, ex-MI6 agent Christopher Steele, former FBI Director James Comey and other prominent political and intelligence figures. According to Fox News, Trump's legal team is suing for ""tens of millions of dollars in attorneys' fees, damages exceeding $100 million, and 'for our democracy'"". The former president's legal action comes amid Special Counsel John Durham probe into the origins of the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation codenamed Crossfire Hurricane. Still, Trump is not inclined to wait until the special counsel wraps his inquiry up. ""The Trump brand has been damaged monetarily, so Donald Trump is taking necessary steps in this civil suit to gain a measure of redress,"" says Ortel. ""No doubt he will amend the suit, if it is not dismissed to add in relevant developments as Durham advances his investigations and prosecutions."" The Wall Street analyst forecasts that Durham has purview over criminal matters and, if he follows leads back into their true history, ""he will have to take on many former presidents and their Deep State allies."" According to the Associated Press, Trump's lawsuit appears to be part of a ""longtime legal strategy."" The news outlet notes that Trump has mastered himself over decades in ""repurposing political and personal grievances into causes of legal action."" Speaking to Newsmax, Trump attorney Alina Habba announced that more lawsuits are coming. ""We have another suit being filed shortly,"" Habba said. ""And anybody that’s going to try and make up malicious stories about him while he was sitting as president, prior to his presidency or now is going to be sued."" The US mainstream media is expected to be trying to silence and ridicule Trump's effort, suggests Ortel. Following Trump's announcement of going after Hillary Clinton and her team, Hillary's spokesperson Nick Merrill stated that the former president's initiative is ""nonsense."" Nevertheless, they will have to respond to it, according to the analyst. If Trump's lawsuit isn't dismissed, it may amplify the ongoing internal political struggle within the Democratic Party, according to the Wall Street analyst. Trump's move comes as rumours of Hillary and Bill Clinton's political comeback is circulated by the press as the Biden-Harris administration poll numbers are continuing to plummet. ""What may be happening is a war to decide who will lead the Democrat Party – in this conflict Team Obama likely wants Team Biden and Team Clinton gone from relevance,"" suggests Ortel. ""So, it may be that the Swamp will cooperate in a restoration and deification of the Obama brand by piling on Clinton, Biden and Bush corruption."" To complicate matters even further, the New York Post and the Daily Mail have gone ballistic on Joe Biden's son, Hunter, by saying that the latter was involved in funding controversial Ukrainian bio-laboratories which studied dangerous pathogens, including those that could be used in biological warfare. The bombshells were dropped after Jack Maxey, a political activist and former Steve Bannon podcast co-host, stated that he would make ""laptop from hell"" files public. The content of the laptop, which was reportedly abandoned by Hunter Biden in a Delaware repair shop, was verified by The New York Times, 17 months after the story was broken by The New York Post. According to Ortel, Hunter's laptop revelations have triggered further suspicions about the Democratic establishment's conduct between 2016 and 2020, when Donald Trump had been smeared, attacked and impeached by the Dems.

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has already arrived in Israel to take part in a historic two-day summit. The foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Bahrain, and Morocco are expected in the country later today. A source in the Gulf familiar with the matter told Sputnik that the summit will focus on a number of regional issues. One of them is Syria and the readmission of the country into the fold of Arab states.  Others are the war in Ukraine and the bolstering of military cooperation between Israel and other participants of the summit.  Yet, the source reiterated that the most important issues to be addressed are the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iran's nuclear programme. Recent reports have suggested that Tehran is close to inking a deal regarding its nuclear progremme with the US and other Western powers. According to that agreement, if it comes to fruition, Iran would commit to stall its nuclear ambitions in exchange for Washington lifting most of its sanctions. The Islamic Republic is also demanding that the White House remove Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of the Iranian military, from the list of terror organisations, a move that Washington is seriously considering.  Tamam Busafi, a Manama-based political analyst, says that this development has leaders in Israel, Egypt, Morocco, and the Gulf worried. Iran has been challenging Israel, Egypt, Morocco, and the Gulf for years. Aside from working on its nuclear programme - which many in the region believe will be directed against Israel and the Gulf - Iran has also funded a number of its allies, such as Lebanon's Shiite militia Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have staged multiple attacks against Saudi and Emirati targets. It is believed that Tehran has been actively stirring up anti-government sentiments in Bahrain and that it is working on triggering unrest in Western Sahara over which Morocco claims ownership. It is for these reasons, says Busafi, that regional leaders are meeting in Israel to show that they are forming a joint front and that they no longer rely on America to provide them with security. Israel and its neighbours have already taken a number of steps in that direction. The Jewish state and Egypt have boosted security cooperation. The country's top military brass have visited the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco to coordinate actions, deals have been signed, and equipment has been delivered. The source in the Gulf suggests that these developments are a cause for concern in Washington, especially as the US has played a pivotal role in the establishment of ties between Israel and the four Muslim states whose ministers will be present at the summit. And this is why, they insist on Blinken's arrival so that ""things don't get out of hand"". Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Oil and gas companies are also obligated to use what they have, the president said, pointing to 9,000 unused but approved production permits for federal lands, amounting to more than a million unused acres that US oil and gas companies supposedly have the right to exploit. If they don’t use the land, Biden suggested, they should pay up. “For US oil companies that are recording their largest profits in years, they can put those profits to productive use by producing more […] restarting idle wells, or producing on the sites they are already leasing.” American families, the president said, “can’t afford to let oil companies sit on their hands.”What they shouldn’t be doing, he argued, is shipping those profits to investors – $80 billion in the last year alone, he claimed, and likely to increase in 2022. While insisting he was a “capitalist,” Biden chided oil companies for cashing in over “Putin’s price hike” while Americans struggled to put food on the table.“I have no problem with corporations turning a good profit,” Biden insisted, but “investing those profits in production and innovation, that’s what they should do. Invest in your customers. It’s not [just] the patriotic view; it’s good for your business as well.”Biden eventually acknowledged that getting oil production restarted took time, but promised to release one million barrels per day from the nation’s strategic oil reserves over the next six months, amounting to 180 million barrels, as a stopgap measure.This bounty would be temporary, Biden warned, stating that ultimately the US and the rest of the world would have to wean itself off fossil fuels and speed the transition to a “clean energy future that’s made in America with American products and American values.” To get that project off the ground, the president announced he would be using the Defense Production Act to secure an American supply chain for electric vehicle batteries and the minerals needed to make them: lithium, graphite, nickel, and other elements that are scarce in the US but abundant in countries like Russia and China.Biden, troublingly, did not explain how specifically the Defense Production Act would secure a supply chain for these minerals, and suggested that the country would be involved in spreading the gospel of green energy, exporting those technologies around the world.He admitted his ideas had come from America’s 11 largest utility companies, whose CEOs visited him earlier in the month, but insisted they had told him energy savings would show up in families’ bills immediately and promised a $6,500 per home payment for families to weatherize their homes.As for the reasons behind the US’ fuel problems in the first place, Biden blamed first the Covid-19 pandemic for sending the demand for oil plummeting, then the “strength and speed of our recovery” for sending it soaring skyward once again. He ultimately settled on Russian President Vladimir Putin as the real source of Americans’ troubles and the reason why gas rose over a dollar per gallon in many cities as soon as the first Russian soldier set foot in Ukraine.“Our family budgets, your family budgets, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war,” Biden lamented. While the US gets less than 3% of its oil from Moscow, Biden has repeatedly linked the spike in fuel prices directly to his embargo on Russian oil and gas, eager to be seen as the one dealing out punishment to Russia.Biden also promised he would not be dissuaded from his plan, revealing he was “open to deals to strengthen the plan but I will not be put off.” He would do whatever was necessary “to protect you from Putin’s price hike,” Biden said, declaring “Americans can’t afford [politics] right now,” but that “we’re the only nation that has turned every crisis we’ve ever faced into an opportunity.”"

If I feel like playing more games, if I don’t feel like I don’t play. I’m the boss, period.“I live one day at a time, tomorrow only God knows. I enjoy football and I still feel useful both at the club and at the national team. I will decide when I want, not when they understand fans, family or journalists. I have always decided my life and that is what I will continue to do.”A post shared by Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano)Ronaldo, who captains the Portuguese national team, has had an exemplary international career.Last year he became the all-time record goalscorer in men's international football when he scored two late headed goals in a 2-1 home win against the Republic of Ireland in the World Cup qualification campaign.His record currently stands at 115 goals in 185 appearances for his country.And ahead of what would, on the surface at least, appear to be Ronaldo's final opportunity to win a World Cup, the Manchester United star has called on Portuguese fans to step up ahead of the match with North Macedonia.“I urge the fans – I want hell breaking loose at Dragao [Stadium],” Ronaldo said.“I went to bed last night thinking that I want the stadium to shut down the music for our national anthem and let the fans sing it acapella to show our passion, our strength and union around the objective of reaching the World Cup.“For us, this game is a matter of life and death. There is a responsibility to win this game. For us, also a game of our lives. [North Macedonia] have surprised [opponents] in many games but I believe they will not surprise us.”Ronaldo has also been linked with an exit from Manchester United this summer if, as expected, the club fail to qualify for the Champions League. Both Sporting Lisbon, where Ronaldo began his career, and Porto are said to have registered an interest in bringing him back to play in his home country.Elsewhere in World Cup qualification, Poland will take on Sweden at the Silesian Stadium in Chorzow – with Poland being granted a bye into the playoff final after original semifinal opponents Russia were removed from the match by UEFA due to the military operation in Ukraine."

Lauber is also under investigation.The FIFA chief is reportedly suspected of seeking information on investigations about FIFA and former executives at the organizations, potentially with the intention of influencing the course of those cases.Match said that a ""softer"" decision on Russia's membership could increase Infantino's risk of receiving tougher measures from the Swiss justice system because the state has an ""anti-Russian political agenda.""No Russian representatives are said to have been accredited for the Congress. Alexei Sorokin, the former general director of the organizing committee for the 2018 World Cup, and a group of Russian specialists related to that tournament are reportedly in Qatar.Local dignitary Alexey Sorokin told the outlet on Monday that he saw no grounds for a temporary or permanent removal of Russia's FIFA membership.Sorokin said that the RFU needed to communicate with international federations and build relationships, adding that he expected UEFA to compensate Russia over the relocation of the Champions League final in May from St. Petersburg to Paris.Karpin spoke on Monday of his hope that Russia would return to the international football arena soon.""The situation is changing every day,"" the former international said of the playoffs, in which Poland – who were given a bye – will play Sweden on Tuesday in the final that could have featured Russia."

The investigation came after Scotland Yard received evidence from a separate inquiry on the alleged parties conducted by senior civil servant Sue Gray.","London's Metropolitan Police (Met) is due to issue the first tranche of fixed penalty notices (FPNs) to government officials as part of its probe into purported lockdown-breaking Downing Street parties, The Guardian has cited unnamed sources as saying. The claims come after the Met said last week that Scotland Yard detectives involved in the case had begun to interview people as witnesses, and that it would proceed with the investigation as ""quickly as possible"". Senior Tory MPs previously called on the Met to wrap up their ""partygate"" probe as soon as possible, which they said would allow Prime Minister Boris Johnson to focus on issues pertaining to London's response to the ongoing Russian military operation in Ukraine. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, for his part, said that ""if the PM has made his declaration, unless they've got evidence he's lied, they should clear him"". Smith was apparently referring to the prime minister claiming in January that he thought a ""bring your own booze"" party at 10 Downing Street he attended was a ""work event"". The Met probe has already seen more than 50 Downing Street insiders contacted over their alleged involvement in the ""partygate"" scandal after Scotland Yard sent legal questionnaires to individuals at Number 10 over their purported participation in alleged rule-busting events. The Scotland Yard investigation followed the publication in late February of the initial findings of senior civil servant Sue Gray's report on the ""partygate"" allegations. The document pointed out that there were ""failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office"" and that ""some of the events should not have been allowed to take place"". The release of Gray's report saw Johnson apologising and reshuffling his senior staff, but making it clear that he intends to ""get on"" with his job. In a separate development in February, UK media outlets claimed that more than 100 Conservative MPs will be ready to turn against Johnson if a no-confidence vote against him is triggered. It takes 54 letters of no confidence from Conservative MPs to trigger such a vote. Between 30 and 45 lawmakers are understood to have already sent letters to the chair of the Conservatives' 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

As examples, Secretary of State Antony Blinken cited “genocide” of Uighurs and repression in Tibet and Hong Kong.China is “attempting to intimidate, harass, and repress dissidents and human rights defenders inside and outside,” Blinken said, adding that “perpetrators of human rights abuses must continue to face consequences.”The US “rejects efforts by [People’s Republic of China] officials to harass, intimidate, surveil and abduct members of ethnic and religious minority groups, including those who seek safety abroad, and US citizens, who speak out on behalf of these vulnerable populations,” Blinken said in a statement released by the State Department on Monday afternoon.US sanctions target those officials “who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, policies or actions” targeting these communities, activists, and civil society “in China and beyond,” the State Department said, adding, “We are committed to defending human rights around the world.”As an example of China’s “transnational repression,” the US said Beijing was trying to silence Uighur activists “serving the American people” by denying permissions to their family members to leave China.Washington urged Beijing to “end its ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, repressive policies in Tibet, crackdown on fundamental freedoms in Kong Kong,” and other abuses elsewhere.The announcement comes after Friday’s call between US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, in which Washington threatened China with “consequences” unless it disavowed Russia and joined the US-led embargo against Moscow. China is a sovereign country opposed to unilateral sanctions and reserves the right to defend its interests accordingly, the government in Beijing said in response. Xi told Biden that China stands for peace and against war and backed a diplomatic solution of the Ukraine conflict.“All sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace,” said the Chinese readout of the presidential phone conversation."

The un-named 19-year-old went absent without leave (AWOL) from the elite Coldstream Guards regiment barracks in Windsor to join the Ukrainian ""Foreign Legion"" two weeks ago. British newspaper The Sun on Sunday reported he had returned to the UK via Poland after contacting senior officers from Ukraine. “He was in touch with his chain of command, who told him that he had to return,"" the source added. “He knew he would be in trouble but was also told in no uncertain terms that it would be worse the longer he stayed out there.” The squaddie was taken in for questioning by military police on arrival, but was not detained and has been allowed to go home to his family in the north of England. But the Sun reported that he is now likely to face a court-martial trial. UK Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin recently warned it is “unlawful” for serving troops to go and fight in another country's army. The Sun also claimed the chiefs of staff are worried that if British soldiers are taken prisoner, Russia could claim the UK is intervening directly in the conflict. But early in the conflict Foreign Secretary Liz Truss encouraged Brits to go and fight against the Russian ""de-Nazification"" campaign in Ukraine.  But it also emerged that the young soldier had been one of some 1,000 foreign recruits at the NATO-built training training camp at Yavorov, 12 miles from the Polish border, that was destroyed in a Russian long-range missile strike last week. Kiev admitted to only 35 Ukrainian troops killed in the attack, but the Russian Ministry of Defence claims 180 ""foreign mercenaries"" died — and some informal sources say the toll has since risen higher. A British ex-serviceman who also joined the Ukrainian foreign legion said he met the teenage soldier at Yavorov. ""The Coldstream Guard was very open about the fact he was still serving,"" he said. “He said he had been to the Falklands for six months, but was bored in the UK and wanted to see some action and use his training."" ""At first, he had no intention of returning to the UK but people told him he should and that he was in trouble as going AWOL is a serious offence,"" the older volunteer related. ""I don’t know if he told them he was leaving, but I think he had help from people over there to travel back over the Polish border. Myself and other British people told him he should return, so in the end he has obviously listened."" Several former British servicemen are known to have signed up to fight in Ukraine — for wages of just 7,000 hryvnia (£180) per month — including Ben Grant, a former Royal Marine and son of Conservative MP for Maidstone and The Weald Helen Grant.

From there, he is expected to head to Poland on Friday to discuss the Ukraine crisis.","The White House will discuss the potential use of nuclear weapons with allies and partners in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has said. Putin ordered Russia's nuclear forces to be placed on heightened alert late last month, citing ""aggressive statements"" by British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss about possible NATO involvement in the Ukraine crisis. On 1 March, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called on the US to remove its nuclear weapons from Europe and dismantle associated infrastructure. Commenting on Biden's upcoming Europe trip, Sullivan said the president won't be seeking to pressure Washington's allies to immediately ban Russian energy supplies, but that he does plan to announce a ""joint response"" aimed at reducing Europe's dependence on Moscow. The US and its allies will also ""have the opportunity to coordinate on the next phase of military assistance to Ukraine,"" and will be imposing ""further sanctions on Russia, and tightening the existing sanctions to crack down on evasion and ensure robust enforcement,"" he added. Commenting on Biden's announcement earlier this month on the near total ban on Russian energy imports into the US, Sullivan said the president has made clear that he was ""not going to pressure"" allies to follow suit. ""From his perspective, what we have achieved with our European partners in terms of financial sanctions, export controls and other measures to hit the Russian economy hard have had unprecedented impact on a large economy on a scale we have never seen before."" Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine on 24 February which Putin said was aimed at ""demilitarising"" the country and ridding it of the outsized influence of neo-Nazi elements in the government and armed forces. The operation was started after a request for assistance from the Donbass republics, which faced weeks of escalated shelling, sabotage and sniper attacks by the Ukrainian military before being formally recognized as independent states by Russia on 21 February. In March, the Russian Ministry of Defence began presenting evidence of suspected Ukrainian plans to launch a full-scale offensive in the Donbass, and reporting on the presence of a network of Pentagon-funded biological laboratories in the country which US officials and media first denied but later confirmed existed.

Kennedy Journalism Awards, been a Pulitzer Prize finalist, published more than 20 books and have seen my political cartoons and columns appear in hundreds of newspapers and magazines. So why do I have Russian state media as one of my clients?","I’m on Sputnik News’ website—as a freelancer, not on staff—and a frequent guest on its radio feed for the same reason that former New York Times war correspondent Chris Hedges and former MSNBC talk host Ed Schultz appeared on the now-shuttered RT America television network: I’m a leftist. It’s an article of faith that the United States is a conservative country. But 38% of American voters prefer socialism to capitalism. That’s a remarkable figure considering this country’s history of suppressing the Left from the Palmer raids to McCarthyism to the methodical legislative destruction of trade unionism. The American Left is bigger than you may think, and it’s growing. Yet leftist voices—antiwar, anti-capitalist, militantly environmentalist—are nowhere to be found in the mainstream, corporate-owned print, broadcast and online news media outlets consumed by the vast majority of U.S. citizens. It doesn’t matter how entertaining or relevant or smart or funny you are. Communists, socialists, anarchists, left-libertarians, deep-green environmentalists and populist progressives need not apply as opinion columnists, radio or television commentators. There isn’t even space in mainstream media for pundits who align with establishment progressives like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, whose ideas are indistinguishable from old-school liberal Democrats like Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern. Fortunately, some leftists have found a home on RT or Sputnik. Conservative critics have often accused them of being mouthpieces for the Russian government. But that’s not my experience of the Americans I know. They had their own opinions and found a platform where those opinions were welcome. Working for Sputnik puts a target on your back. Even though I’m not on staff, Twitter and Facebook label links to my Sputnik cartoons as Russian state media. And in the current atmosphere of hysteria over the Russia-Ukraine war to which the U.S. isn’t even a party, reactionaries tar me with that 1950s Cold War classic, guilt by association. Just this week, for example, another cartoonist had the nads to call me “a traitor to American ideals and to democracy,” “Putin’s puppet, a Kremlin propagandist, and a useful idiot.” If this were the 18th century, I’d demand satisfaction from the cur. Useful idiot, of course, is an insult popularized by fascists during McCarthyism. It is still used by the extreme right. I’m curious: what would this neoconservative, who was in favor of invading both Afghanistan and Iraq and now wants another stupid war in Ukraine, have people like me do? Sit in silence forever? Apparently, yes. If you’re on the “actual left,” with a worldview influenced by Marxist class analysis rather than identitarianism, no amount of talent or popularity will get you on the airwaves or into “respectable” print. Until last week, if you were a lucky leftist, you’d be invited to host a show on RT or appear as a guest, where—unlike on CNN, MSNBC or Fox—you’d be treated with respect, asked intelligent questions and given time to answer them. Is it really possible that there are no insightful communist economics experts? No funny socialist editorial cartoonists? No sharp, telegenic, anarcho-syndicalist TV commentators? Of course, such mythical creatures exist—they appeared on RT and, before it was deplatformed by Comcast and DirecTV in 2016, Al Jazeera America. The real reason for the Left’s lack of representation in mainstream media, one suspects, is ideological discrimination. If “democracy dies in darkness,” as The Washington Post’s motto reads, why not allow all ideas to be discussed openly? Even cable TV’s most “liberal” channel refuses to air content to the left of the center of the Democratic Party. MSNBC fired left-leaning political talk host Phil Donahue in February 2003, at the peak of the build-up to the invasion of Iraq, even though he had the highest ratings of any program on the network. Bosses blamed production costs. But an internal MSNBC memo worried that Donahue presented a “difficult public face for NBC in a time of war,” and provided “a home for the liberal antiwar agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity.” “They were terrified of the antiwar voice,” Donahue recalled. Twelve years later, MSNBC fired feisty pro-worker talker Ed Schultz. He claimed that they fired him for insisting upon covering Bernie Sanders’ 2015 campaign launch speech. “You're not covering Bernie Sanders,” network president Phil Griffin ordered Schultz. RT’s diverse team of commentators wasn’t limited to leftists. The roster included Hedges, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura, “Star Trek” actor William Shatner, ex-CNN host Larry King, leftist comedian Lee Camp and right-wing pundits Dennis Miller and Steve Malzberg. Guests included academic experts, political activists and politicians like former Green Party presidential candidates Ralph Nader and Jill Stein, both of whom were marginalized by U.S. news media and denied spots in presidential debates. The small sliver of American viewers who gave RT a chance encountered excellent production values and high-quality news and opinion programs that didn’t talk down to the audience. RT was unpredictable, entertaining and frequently more engaging than the three major cable news channels. It was nominated for five Emmys. Critics of RT and Sputnik, however, have complained that RT shines a spotlight on schisms in U.S. politics and society, for example, “push[ing] divisive racial narratives, including stories emphasizing allegations of police abuse in the United States and highlighting racism against African-Americans within the military,” as The New York Times wrote in 2020. Since when, however, is the U.S. or any other government entitled to positive news coverage? If racism makes America look bad, don’t eliminate coverage of racism—eliminate racism. Opponents also deride RT and Sputnik’s news coverage as Russian government propaganda. Which is, of course, objectively subjective. On RT/Sputnik as on other outlets, bias is largely a matter of omission. In my experience what runs on Sputnik is fact-checked. But it shouldn’t be anyone’s go-to source for criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, any more than you should look to MSNBC for harsh takes on Joe Biden or Fox for sharp attacks on Donald Trump. One could argue, and many on the Left have, that “respectable” American news outlets have frequently worn their biases on their sleeves, and are often accused of disseminating propaganda. The absence of thoughtful antiwar voices when false WMD claims were made during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq and denying coverage to Bernie Sanders come to mind. RT America shut down last week after it was deplatformed by Roku, DirecTV and cable networks. Before it went dark on television, it had earned a sizable online audience. In 2013 the channel became the first to reach 1 billion views on YouTube, numbers driven in part by its willingness to cover third-party candidacies that no one else would touch and round-the-clock reporting on the Occupy Wall Street movement. The leftist Australian blogger Caitlyn Johnstone has frequently remarked that RT America and Sputnik News would have become instantly unviable had left-leaning voices been invited onto mainstream American media outlets.  I agree. When I tell friends that I’m on Sputnik News, an online radio service and news site accessible via the web and therefore less vulnerable to Ukraine-related cancellation in the United States than in Europe, where it is banned, some cock their heads and give that “Really?” expression. Those who check it out are impressed, surprised that the overall tenor of discussion is smarter and sharper than, say, NPR. Sputnik is still operational, with 57 million visits online in the last month. They grant me a platform for my ideas, which are discussed by an appreciative, well-informed audience. They don’t censor me. And they pay. Until the revolution destroys capitalism, leftists must compromise their principles in order to survive. I’ve never been published by a media organization with which I shared all of my political ideals. As a realist with bills to pay, where would I find a media organization with which I share most of my political ideals? I disagree with Sputnik about various issues; I also disagree with NPR and even with Jacobin, the socialist magazine. I would work for pretty much any media outlet that doesn’t constrain my freedom of expression beyond what I consider reasonable limits. (Sputnik has never told me what to say, which is more than I can say for many of my other clients.) But over the past 20 or so years, the media has been turning farther and farther to the right. Left voices, especially before 9/11, were occasionally allotted space alongside liberal Democrats on the opinion pages. I was one of them. Leftists sometimes appeared on cable news television. Again, I was one of them. So was Rachel Maddow. She survived, and thrived, by moving right into mainstream liberalism. That tiny sliver of openness has vanished. Anti-interventionists rarely if ever—I would say never, but I can’t watch 24-7—appear on those panels of talking heads who discuss foreign policy crises; the acceptable range of discussion runs from pro-interventionist to more pro-interventionist. When is the last time you heard anyone on cable news suggest that the U.S. ought to stay out of an overseas hot spot entirely, that it’s not our business? All the Left needs for a fair shot at readers and viewers is one angel investor. But millionaires tend to dislike socialism. George Soros, bête noir of the right, funds Democrats, not lefties. This piece was submitted to The New York Times and The Washington Post. Both rejected it. For leftists, Sputnik is still one of the few games in town.

Berlin is under pressure from a number of EU members to introduce such a ban as part of the West's anti-Russian sanctions over Moscow's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. ","Chancellor Olaf Scholz has suggested that Germany stopping imports of Russian coal and oil ""can already happen this year"". The remarks echoed those made by German Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Action Robert Habeck on Saturday, when he said in an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that Berlin plans to become independent of Russian coal by this fall, and almost abandon Russian oil by the end of the year. He stressed that abandoning Russian gas will be harder due to Germany having no capacities for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG). At the same time, the minister asserted that there are no reasons to believe that Russia will stop energy exports, but Berlin is preparing ""for every scenario"". Earlier last week, Habeck told reporters about the need for Germany to diversify energy supplies to abandon Russian imports. According to the German Economy Ministry, the share of Russian oil supplies to the country amounts to 35%, while the share of coal stands at about 50%. He spoke as Chancellor Scholz told German lawmakers last Wednesday that Berlin would end its energy dependence on Moscow in due course but that cutting all ties right now would ride roughed over the German economy. He then referred to a host of sanctions by the US and its allies imposed in response to Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. The latter aims to demilitarise and de­-Nazify the country and is only targeting its military infrastructure with high­-precision weapons. As part of the sanctions, the US banned all Russian energy imports. In a separate development on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Moscow will demand that Europe start paying for gas supplies in roubles, as part of Russia's response to the ""severe"" sanctions by the West. ""I have decided to implement a set of measures to transfer payments for our gas supplies to unfriendly countries into Russian roubles"", Putin said, ordering the changes to be implemented within a week. Russia deems all countries that have hit it with sanctions following its special op in Ukraine as ""unfriendly"". The Russian president ordered the start of a special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February following a request from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) to protect them from intensifying attacks by the Ukrainian armed forces. Putin stated that Russia was left with no other choice but to intervene in order to render assistance to the newly-recognised Donbass republics, and that Moscow doesn't plan to occupy Ukraine. Russia's Defence Ministry, for its part, underscored that Ukrainian civilians are out of danger because the operation only targets the country's military infrastructure.

If backed by Congress, the move would downsize the US’ total F-22 fleet from 186 to 153 jets. Plans to move the craft to Virginia from Eglin AFB in Florida have been on pause for more than three years, and the air force has stated that the older F-22s currently used for training would simply be too expensive to keep in fighting shape, according to the branch’s deputy assistant budget secretary Major General James Peccia. Those upgrades would cost nearly $2 billion over the next eight years, funds the air force would rather put into newer planes.The remaining F-22s would be stationed at bases in Virginia, Hawaii, Florida and Alaska, air force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said.US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, meanwhile, said he does not foresee any additional F-22 retirements anytime soon, calling the craft the military’s “premier air-to-air combat platform.”The effort to save funds for research and development comes as the White House proposes the largest military budget in US history, seeking $813.3 billion over the next year, or $31 billion more than was approved for 2022. The proposal includes $682 million in military aid for Ukraine, as well as a 9.5% boost in R&D funding, putting the total over $130 billion. While the army, navy and Marines could see a cumulative cut of some 4,300 personnel, the air force is set to grow by 200 new troops."

","The Joint List, a left-wing alliance of Arab parties in the Israeli Parliament snubbed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's speech to the legislature, as only one Arab lawmaker out of their 10 Members of Knesset (MKs) showed up, according to The Times of Israel. The newspaper quoted party officials as saying that the online speech was skipped by Joint List chief Ayman Odeh, followed by two other lawmakers from the alliance's Hadash Party. This came as Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel and several MKs from other parties harshly criticised Zelensky over making comparisons between the Holocaust and Russia's special operation during his Knesset speech, in which he apparently ignored some Ukrainians' complicity in the Nazi-led genocide of Jews. Israeli media outlets also quoted unnamed senior ministers as lashing out at what they dubbed Zelensky's ""outrageous comparison"". The ministers argued that the Ukrainian president ""[…] distorted the part his country played in the murder of Jews"". Likud MK Yuval Steinitz asserted that Zelensky's comparison ""borders on Holocaust denial"". In his speech that was delivered via Zoom, the Ukrainian president also wondered why Kiev cannot ""receive weapons"" from Israel, including its Iron Dome missile defence system, and why the Jewish state ""has not imposed powerful sanctions on Russia or is not putting pressure on Russian business"". The US and its allies imposed packages of tough sanctions on Russia after it launched a special military operation on 24 February to demilitarise and de­-Nazify Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the operation only aims to destroy Ukrainian military infrastructure with high-precision weapons strikes. On Monday, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov noted that since the beginning of the special operation, 216 unmanned aerial vehicles, 1,506 tanks, and 152 multiple rocket launchers of the Ukrainian Army have already been obliterated. Russian troops also eliminated 592 field artillery pieces and mortars, as well as  more than 1,260 units of special military vehicles, according to him. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Sydney included two billionaires with mining industry links, while Tokyo targeted the military industry and an arms exporter.“Australia has now added two billionaires with links to business interests in Australia, Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg,” said Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne in a statement on Friday, adding that the government welcomed the principled decision of Australian companies to abandon their ties with Russia “in protest of Moscow’s illegal, indefensible war against Ukraine.”Viktor Vekselberg is a Russian energy investor. He was also reported to be interested in a company working with the Australia Origin Energy on a gas project in the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory, although the firm denied his participation in the project. Oleg Deripaska is the founder of the aluminum giant Rusal and its parent company En+ Group.The businessmen are the latest additions to a list of 41 Russian businessmen and their family members already facing economic sanctions in Australia.Japan announced that it was imposing sanctions on 15 more individuals and nine more organizations, including Rosoboronexport, the state-owned arms exporter, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, as well as military equipment makers.Tokyo has now imposed restrictive measures such as asset freezes on 76 individuals, seven banks and 12 other organizations, according to its finance ministry. The measures came in response to Russia’s offensive in Ukraine. Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

All sides suffer from the aggravation of relations, Young continued, adding that stopping the conflict would benefit everyone. Young warned that the current crisis would have no winners. According to the ex-envoy, the US and Russia share many interests and should try to reach peace in Ukraine. Young, now 90, represented the US at the United Nations from 1977 to 1979 under then-President Jimmy Carter. He gave an example of cooperation between the two countries during that period. The diplomat also referred to Soviet-US cooperation during and just after World War II. Young, who called himself a peacemaker, noted the importance of culture in building bridges between countries. On 24 February, Russia began a military operation in Ukraine in response to calls from the Donbass republics for help in countering intensifying attacks by Ukrainian troops. The Russian Defence Ministry said the special operation is targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure only. It accused Kiev's forces of using typical terrorist methods, such as hiding behind civilians and in residential quarters. The US and its allies have responded with comprehensive sanctions, including restrictions on the Russian central bank, export control measures, SWIFT cutoff for select banks, and closure of airspace to all Russian flights. Many companies have even suspended their Russian operations. At the same time, Andrew Young noted that high inflation may represent a risk to democracy in the United States as well as political stability. The former diplomat said that the conflict in Ukraine, which is one of factors behind the high prices, has unified civil society in the US. Young also supposed that the possible replacement of Russian energy sources by oil from Iran and Venezuela might reflect US interests. Last week, the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates for the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and said there could be another six hikes this year if inflation remains high.

According to the newspaper, the White House summoned government lawyers to discussions with the Pentagon regarding what lethal weapons could be delivered to Ukraine without violating international law. However, the legal advice has only provided limited help in easing the White House's headache from solving this task, the newspaper sources added. As a result, the Biden administration faces a ""tangle of decisions, and sometimes tortured distinctions"" as it tries to determine what assistance it can safely offer Kiev, the NY Times said. These deliberations reportedly resulted in the rejection of the no-fly zone idea and the shipments of jet fighters to Ukraine, but gave the green light to supplies of anti-tank weaponry. These limited shipments are being overseen by CIA officers, sources claim. However, the volumes are much smaller than when the spy agency supplied Afghan Mujahedeen with weapons to fight Soviet troops in the 1980s, the sources say. It was another result of the deliberations at the White House, which decided that such assistance would be an ""unnecessary provocation"". In its desperation to scrape together any valid help for Ukraine, the White House even considered negotiating the delivery of S-400s from Turkey – the very systems Ankara ordered in 2017 and which spoiled relations between the two NATO allies. After severing Turkey from F-35 shipments over the purchase, Washington is now considering trying to convince Ankara to ditch the systems another way – by gifting them to Kiev. It is unclear, however, if the White House has decided to go forward with this plan. US President Joe Biden earlier turned down repeated requests from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to establish a no-fly zone above Ukraine after Russia launched a special military operation to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" the country. Biden said that there won't be a no-fly zone above Ukraine and not a single US soldier will be sent to fight in the country, as either option might trigger a Third World War. POTUS stressed that such an armed conflict could end up being a nuclear one. Let's stay in touch no matter what! Follow our Telegram channel to get all the latest news: https://t.me/sputniknewsus "

Of these, 208 were eligible to vote and 191 decided to do so.In order to be accepted, the proposal – put forward at a February 24 FIFA Council meeting and which included adding Arabic and Portuguese as well as Russian to the list of official languages – needed a majority of 156 votes but passed by some way with 187 'yes' votes to four 'no' votes in total.Prior to Thursday's vote, FIFA's official languages were English, Spanish, French and German. News of the proposal had previously been shared by German reporter Markus Harm on social media and was confirmed by the FIFA press service, according to TASS.  The decision comes despite FIFA and UEFA banning all Russian teams from international events last month following the start of Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine.That step meant that the Russian men's national football team were barred from the 2022 Qatar World Cup qualifiers, while the women's national team are set to miss the UEFA European Championships in England this summer. Nonetheless, a Russian delegation was in Doha at the 72nd FIFA Congress where the vote was held.Russian football official Alexey Sorokin, insisted that they deserved be there, as reports revealed that there was no dissent from other national associations when their presence was announced.""We are not hiding. We have every right to be here,"" Sorokin said, as Russia also avoided a potential vote on expulsion.""We find it kind of strange that the Russian team was not allowed to play in this [2022 World Cup] qualification,"" he added.""It’s strange. We feel that our football players and football lovers have nothing to do with (the military operation)."" Despite their sanctions, Russia have shown an interest in hosting the UEFA European Championships in either 2028 or 2032, and Sorokin pointed out that ""it is a long time until 2032.""  ""It’s a dual-year bid – we have the choice of 2028 or 2032. We need to start,"" Sorokin stressed when probed on whether the RFU's bid could overcome that from the UK and Ireland for 2028."

Col. Karen Kwiatkowski, a former analyst for the US Department of Defence. ""Biden probably repeated what he had been briefed prior to his visit to Poland."" On Monday, Joe Biden was questioned by Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy about what the president meant by telling American troops stationed in Poland: ""You’re going to see when you’re there, and some of you have been there, you’re gonna see — you’re gonna see women, young people standing in the middle — in front of a damned tank just saying, ‘I’m not leaving, I’m holding my ground.'"" The remarks were perceived by some as revealing Washington's plans to put US boots in Ukraine. The White House hastily specified that this wasn't the case. However, while answering Doocy's question, the US president said: ""We were talking about helping train the troops in — that are — the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland."" This clearly contradicted US National Security Adviser Jack Sullivan's statement that the US was not training Ukrainian soldiers. General Tod Wolters, Commander of the United States European Command and NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, asserted to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that the US was not training Ukrainian troops in Poland. However, some US lawmakers alleged that Biden spilled the beans about a ""classified"" Pentagon mission. Biden's words do not seem to be a mere ""gaffe,"" believes geopolitical analyst Tom Luongo. He cites the fact that the rhetoric of the Biden State Department and National Security Council has recently become very aggressive. ""Biden, even if he’s momentarily cogent, could easily just be relaying echoes of previous conversations,"" says Luongo. The US president has recently made a series of bellicose gaffes, including calling the Russian president a ""war criminal"" and claiming that Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power."" Moscow denounced Biden's words as highly inappropriate and reminded him that it's the Russian people who choose their president, not foreign leaders. Judging from the US commander-in-chief's rhetoric, Washington is seeking a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian crisis in words only, according to the observers. ""I don't think the US is interested in a diplomatic resolution,"" says Dave Lindorff. ""For the US, the longer the conflict goes on, the better. It gets back to the late Polish-American National Security advisor Zbignew Brzezinski who wanted to use the Mujahadeen to make Afghanistan into the Soviet Union's 'Vietnam' and to ""kill as many Russians as possible.' Same now in Ukraine. [Secretary of State Antony] Blinken is kind of a low-wattage reincarnation of Brzezinski."" Meanwhile, Biden's gaffes are fraught with the risk of exacerbating Russo-American tensions: according to the New York Post, ""it is not clear whether Russia would view the US training Ukraine’s military as a[n]… escalation."" It can't be ruled out that the Biden administration and its security advisers are mulling over all options, including sending US troops to Ukraine, according to Kwiatkowski. The Biden administration might send American soldiers to fight overseas under some ""proper"" pretext, believes Tom Luongo: ""So scan the British press carefully for signs of what type of false flag they and the US intelligence services will cook up to sell us into yet another disgusting and vile war,"" the geopolitical analyst remarks. On 23 March, the New York Times reported that ""the White House has quietly assembled a team of national security officials"" to consider various Ukraine crisis scenarios including ""a joint military response"" if Russia used ""unconventional"" weapons. ""At the soldier level, the idea of fighting a successful nuclear war has not gained the popularity it has back in the Pentagon E-Ring,"" says Kwiatkowski. ""I suspect, from the looks on the faces of US troops dining with Biden in Poland a few days ago, that they have not actually been consulted about either fighting the Russian Army, or being in the arena of a potential nuclear battlefield."" The retired Pentagon analyst laments the fact that following the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, ""the US government and its cronies"" appear to be ""working frantically to create a new long, tragic, and costly war in Ukraine.""

","Ukrainian forces attempted to conceal the evidence of the existence of a black site prison located inside the Mariupol airport, seized by Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) troops in the middle of March, former member of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), Vasily Prozorov, has said. He further said that he had visited the place since it was seized by the DPR and noticed that Ukrainian forces had removed the metal cladding from the walls of the freezers previously used as a prison known as the ""Library"". Prozorov said that those who went through imprisonment in the ""Library"", are probably the only ones who can give the testimony required to investigate the crimes by Ukrainian troops and nationalist battalions committed at the Mariupol airport. The former SBU member suggested calling for former inmates of the purported black site to come forward and to question airport employees. The interior of a portion of the alleged black site prison at the airport can be seen in a video shot with the help of DPR fighters: Former SBU member Vasily Prozorov believes that the DPR will find zero documents confirming the existence of the reported prison because no commander would ever sign a paper greenlighting the creation of such an illegal detention site. Any reports of imprisonment at the ""Library"" were likely destroyed by the commander responsible for the sector, Prozorov added. Forces from the DPR, acting in cooperation and with assistance from Russian troops, have seized several areas around and inside Mariupol since the start of Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine.

Rather than leaving when his term expires in October and becoming governor of Norway’s central bank, Stoltenberg will be kept posted in Brussels.Stoltenberg said he was “honoured by the decision” of the NATO heads of state to extend his term as Europe faces the “biggest security crisis in a generation” over the conflict in Ukraine. The Norwegian native has led NATO since 2014, and previously served as Norway’s prime minister between 2000 and 2001 – and later between 2005 and 2013. Earlier, he worked as the country’s finance minister and energy minister.Honoured by the decision of #NATO Heads of State and Government to extend my term as Secretary General until 30 September 2023. As we face the biggest security crisis in a generation, we stand united to keep our Alliance strong and our people safe. https://t.co/06YkRkmX8JThe Norwegian Finance Ministry announced on Wednesday it was preparing for Stoltenberg not to be able to take the job, though no specifics were given. Oslo last month named Ida Wolden Bache, previously deputy central bank chief, as governor of the bank for up to nine months, at which point she would presumably cede the job to Stoltenberg.While the search for a replacement for Stoltenberg reportedly began last month, it’s not clear if any candidates have been floated. A meeting of NATO member nations in June was supposed to allow the countries to weigh in on their preferred choices for the new secretary general. NATO has crept eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union, engulfing much of Eastern Europe despite what Moscow views as a verbal agreement between the US and Russia to maintain a buffer zone of neutrality. Russia’s attack on Ukraine last month was triggered in part by Kiev’s stated desire to join the transatlantic alliance. While President Volodymyr Zelensky appears to have backed off that particular goal as many other NATO members were made distinctly uncomfortable by the idea, Ukraine is still seeking membership in the European Union. Zelensky has called on NATO to beef up military support for his country, claiming if they don’t, Russia will attempt to take on “eastern members of NATO, the Baltic states, Poland for sure.”"

Police reported that around 250 vehicles were involved in the demonstration, while the hauliers disputed the figure, claiming up to 350 vehicles took part.Banners attached to the trucks declared “Systemically relevant truckers need fair diesel prices” and “Diesel rip-off: Without us, this country would be on the ground,” as the truckers moved from Hamburg-Allermohe towards the city center.The protests created traffic delays for a second weekend in a row, with a protest the previous weekend having seen 500 participants moving through the city to create chaos on the roads.Trucks roar in rally against high fuel prices in Hamburg, GermanyFollow us on Telegram https://t.co/8u9sqguYRVpic.twitter.com/FzViRbr1TqThe German Fishing Association also claimed on Tuesday that the price of marine diesel has doubled in recent weeks. Higher fuel costs have hit truck drivers in Hamburg, causing operational issues for drivers and companies that rely on the vehicles to transport produce across Germany and other nations.Fuel costs have increased in Germany and in other Western nations in recent weeks following Russia’s military assault on Ukraine. Sanctions imposed on Moscow have impacted the flow of oil and gas from Russia, sending costs in the West spiraling upwards and forcing nations to seek out alternative supply routes to satisfy their dependence on foreign fuel.The protest on Germany’s roads contrasted with another demonstration in another part of the country, by climate protesters Fridays for Future, who unveiled a 400-square-meter banner calling for a “Climate Strike” on March 25. The group stated that there is an “urgent need” for action to address the impact of climate change, including the levels of fuel usage in various countries."

The G7 objected to the move and vowed not to pay. However, Berlin, one of the biggest buyers of Russian gas, has since asked how such transactions may take place.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree regulating gas trade with designated 'unfriendly' states, saying that countries wishing to do business with Moscow must open bank accounts in Russian banks, and stressing that existing contracts will be frozen unless payments are made in rubles. Putin stressed that Russia would continue to meet its obligations to supply gas at volumes and at prices set under existing contracts. However, the need to pay in the Russian currency is not up for negotiation, according to the president. Putin announced on 23 March that Russia would require countries which have introduced sanctions against Russia to pay for their natural gas purchases in rubles. The Russian Central Bank, the government and Gazprom were given one week to amend existing contracts into rubles. Sputnik has obtained the full text of the gas-for-rubles directive. The document, entitled ""On a special procedure for the fulfillment of obligations by foreign buyers to Russian suppliers of natural gas"", orders that payments for gas exported as of 1 April to countries which have engaged in ""unfriendly actions against the Russian Federation, Russian legal entities and individuals"" be made in rubles. Supplies will be frozen if an attempt is made to pay in foreign currency, in the event of a failure to pay in full, or a failure to make payment from an authorised Russian bank. ""The Joint Stock Company Gazprombank, which for the purposes of this decree is an authorised bank ... opens special type K ruble accounts and special type K foreign currency accounts for payments for the gas supplied on the basis of applications made by foreign buyers,"" the document notes. The decree allows the Russian government commission which is responsible for the control of foreign investments to issue permits exempting the ruble payments rule. European gas futures jumped to more than $1,450 per thousand cubic metres immediately after Putin's comments. German's Ministry of Economy chief Robert Habeck told reporters that he ""hasn't seen"" the directive, but stressed that Berlin was well prepared for Russia's decisions on gas supplies and that it wouldn't allow Putin to ""blackmail us"". Putin was said to have informed Scholz that the Russian move on gas payments was caused by the West's decision to freeze some $300 billion in Russian reserves abroad, including in European countries, in the wake of Moscow's military operation in Ukraine. Russian supplies account for more than 40 percent of Germany's natural gas consumption. In his remarks on Thursday, Putin also touched on the global economic crisis threatening the planet, and who he believes is responsible. ""Global markets are falling, but the value of shares in companies in the US military-industrial complex are only growing. Capital is flowing to the United States, depriving other regions of the world of resources for development,"" Putin said.  Step by step, Putin suggested, western politicians were making decisions pushing the world economy to a crisis state. ""They will lead to a breakdown in production and logistics ties, cause inflation to rise, and a decrease in the wellbeing of millions of people, and in the poorest countries, to the tragedy of mass starvation. The food crisis will be followed by another wave of migration, including - and above all - to European countries,"" he predicted. Putin also commented on the prospects facing Russia's aviation industry, and the economy in general. ""I propose to proceed from the fact that previous levels of interaction with our former partners will not be reached in the near future. We are not going to close ourselves off from anyone, and we will not be a closed country. But we must proceed from the realities that are emerging,"" Putin said. ""We have every opportunity to ensure that the aviation industry not only overcomes the present difficulties, but also receives a new impetus for development,"" he suggested. There is also ""room for opportunities for Russian aircraft manufacturers, design bureaus, suppliers of materials, assemblies and components,"" Putin said. The president expressed confidence that the proportion of domestic aircraft in the fleets of Russian airlines will ""grow dramatically"" in the years to come. Russia's domestic aircraft manufacturing industry has a rich and storied history. During the Cold War, Soviet-made civilian passenger airplanes and helicopters accounted for nearly one-third of all aircraft produced globally. Output plunged in the Nineties and Noughties thanks to market reforms, the breakdown of Soviet-era supply chains and lobbying by global aviation giants such as Airbus and Boeing to supply planes to Russian carriers. However, in the 2010s - and particularly after western countries started sanctioning Russia amid the Ukraine crisis that began in 2014 - the government began to devote considerable material resources and other forms of support to domestic aircraft manufacturers.

The dips come days after Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, said the government's central bank was prepared to increase interest rates by half-percentage-point increments, to reel in inflation.  While Tuesday's market close did not appear to reflect a potential rise in interest rates, indexes slumped on Wednesday after observing a rise in the price of Brent crude, a waterborne crude oil used as the international benchmark for much of the world's oil.  Brent crude rose $6.12 a barrel (5.3%) to $121.60, amounting to the third-highest settlement value of the year, according to the Wall Street Journal. Overall, Brent crude has surged 56% in 2022.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the US oil benchmark, also saw a 5% gain, amounting to almost $115 a barrel. As energy stocks rallied, Hess and Diamondback Energy were the top gainers at the S&amp;P 500's close, respectively rising 4.6% and 3.9%. While the S&amp;P 500 has recouped some losses since the beginning of the Kremlin's special military operation in Ukraine, fears of a possible economic downturn remain, particularly as yields on long-term US government bonds slip below yields on short-term bonds.

Brussels banned iron and steel imports from Russia, outlawed the sale of aircraft, spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines, as well as the supplies of goods and technological equipment for the oil, aviation, and space industries. EU citizens have been banned from investing in the Russian energy sector. Dozens of EU companies have halted or stopped operations in Russia.Moscow considers the move unlawful and unjustified and has imposed its own counter measures.Russia attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

Beijing has explicitly stated that it would not budge on its relations with Russia, insisting that it maintains an “independent” stance on the Ukraine conflict, while India has scaled up trade with Moscow in recent weeks, agreeing to purchase Russian crude oil at a discount earlier this month."

The country was due to make a $66 million payment to bondholders on Monday on the bond.According to a source familiar with the situation, JPMorgan worked on Monday with the US Treasury Department on necessary approvals. The payment reportedly moved on to the next stage before the money is handed over to bondholders.Last week, JPMorgan, as a correspondent bank, processed Russia’s payment on two sovereign bonds, handing the funds to payment agent Citigroup. The latter distributed the funds to the bondholders.Making this payment means Russia has avoided a widely expected external bond default. There was speculation in the media that the nation could default for the first time in a century, as much of its foreign currency holdings have been frozen by the US, EU, and a number of other countries.Moscow has used money from frozen accounts to pay its external debt, daring Western countries to try to block the payments. Russia has accused the US and its allies of trying to engineer an artificial default in the country by not allowing it access to its estimated $300 billion in foreign reserves held abroad.Russia has 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion. Prior to the Ukraine crisis, roughly $20 billion was held by investment funds and money managers outside Russia.The country now has to make a $102 million payment on March 28, followed by a $447 million payment that must be made in dollars on March 31. The biggest payment of the year of $2 billion is due on April 4.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

According to findings by Russia’s Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Troops, one company connected to these biolabs and their work was founded by Hunter Biden and Christopher Heinz, the latter the stepson of former US Secretary of State John Kerry. Rosemont Seneca Partners was founded in 2009 by Biden, Heinz and Heinz’s college roommate and fellow financier, Devon Archer, according to the Financial Times. Biden and Heinz were described as company co-owners and Archer as a “managing partner” in a report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The private equity firm was anchored by the Heinz family alternative investment fund, Rosemont Capital, and was formed to “be populated by political loyalists and positioned to strike profitable deals overseas with foreign governments and officials with whom the US government was negotiating,” according to the 2018 book “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,” by Peter Schweizer. This became a problem the following year, when BHR joined the Chinese state-owned defense firm Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) to buy anti-vibration automotive parts from American precision-parts manufacturer Henniges - a deal agreed to during the Obama administration. A US Senate investigation in 2019 found a significant conflict of interest in the deal, as anti-vibration technology is considered “dual use,” having both civilian and military applications. In one notable incident that Joe Biden boasted about years later but which Western media has tried to spin as conspiracy theory, Biden successfully pressured then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire Viktor Shokin, Ukraine’s top prosecutor, who was heading an investigation of Zlochevsky and Burisma. Zlochevsky, meanwhile, was funneling millions to Hunter Biden and Archer for sitting on Burisma’s board and for Rosemont Seneca’s “consulting services,” documents obtained by the Senate probe show. Rosemont Seneca sought to disguise its investments in Burisma, as did top Obama administration officials, including then-Secretary of State John Kerry - Heinz’s stepfather. Heinz attempted to distance himself from Archer’s and Hunter’s decision to join the Burisma board, writing to Kerry’s chief of staff, David Wade, that “based only on Heinz’s assurances, that ‘Rosemont Seneca was not involved’ with Burisma,” Heinz told the Senate probe. According to the paper, Heinz pulled out of Rosemont as a result of his partners’ decision. “The lack of judgment in this matter was a major catalyst for Mr. Heinz ending his business relationships with Mr. Archer and Mr. Biden,” Bastardi suggested.

Security footage of the daring heist has since gone viral on social media as it shows the three men nonchalantly stealing an entire batch of 20 high-end graphics cards.Despite the successful heist, the trio were soon apprehended by police when they tried to sell off the highly sought-after cards to local pawn shops, as one suspicious shop owner reportedly felt something was off when the suspects tried to sell the cards at half the price, and alerted local authorities.It’s unclear how many of the GPUs the trio were able to pawn off, but according to Russian authorities all the cards in their possession were retrieved.The news drew particular attention on social media as the heist occurred amid a worldwide shortage of video cards, while Russians have been facing increasing difficulty in acquiring high-end computer components due to the sanctions imposed on the country and the mass exodus of manufacturers in light of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine. The stolen RTX 3070 TIs are currently worth around $1,900 in Russia, while the same card can be bought in the US for about $500-700."

The president’s son and his partners in a firm called Rosemont Seneca also invested $500,000 in the contractor.At least one of the documents suggested that Metabiota’s interest in Ukraine went beyond research and money-making. An executive with the contractor, Mary Guttieri, explained in an April 2014 memo to Hunter Biden of “how we can potentially leverage our team, networks and concepts to assert Ukraine’s cultural and economic independence from Russia and continued integration into Western society.”Another memo showed that Biden had pitched a “science project” involving Metabiota and Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company where Biden made millions of dollars as a board member. His pay was cut by half after his father’s stint as US vice president ended in January 2017.The revelations come one day after Russian military officials alleged that US agencies and high-level Democrats, including Hunter Biden, have been involved in backing bioweapons research in Ukraine. The officials cited documents that had been seized by Russian soldiers in the former Soviet republic.However, some Western media outlets dismissed the claims as Russian propaganda meant to justify Moscow’s military attack on Ukraine. In many cases, the allegations were brushed off or ridiculed without even taking them seriously enough to include a US government response. For instance, the Daily Beast declared in a headline, “Russia ramps up the crazy,” while state-funded NPR and other outlets referred to the accusations as “false” or “propaganda” without any apparent probing of the facts. Even the Daily Mail itself, before obtaining the latest Biden emails, said Russia had ramped up its “wild propaganda campaign” by making its bioweapons claims.The reaction echoed the response in October 2020, when the New York Post broke a story alleging overseas influence-peddling by the Biden family, citing emails obtained from a laptop that Hunter had abandoned at a Delaware repair shop. Spreading the report was blocked on social media, where the Post was censored, and mainstream media outlets suggested that the scandal was the result of a Russian disinformation campaign.Thus, the original scoop was essentially buried just weeks before Biden was elected president, in an extraordinary case of media bias. However, last week, the New York Times admitted that the laptop and its contents were authentic.Government records show that Metabiota was awarded an $18.4 million contract by the Pentagon, the Daily Mail added. Emails showed that Hunter Biden claimed to be helping the contractor “get new customers,” including government agencies."

Bush and Tony Blair are emerging from political retirement to pontificate on Russia’s “authoritarian bullying” against Ukraine, the question arises: does such a surreal spectacle underscore the public’s notorious short-term memory, or does it prove the media’s vast power to shape public opinion in favor of its latest agenda? All things considered, it’s most likely a wicked combination of the two noxious ingredients.  Whatever the case, it defies reality that these former US and British leaders, whose past military exploits have been described in some quarters as actual war crimes, are now weighing in on the legitimacy of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, or any other conflict for that matter. To put it another way, Bush and Blair acting like long-haired anti-war activists is a bit like Greta Thunberg shaking the pop-poms for the coal industry.Consider, for example, the convoluted comments uttered by George W. Bush on the same day that Russia started its military operation in Ukraine: “Russia’s attack on Ukraine,” the official statement reads, “constitutes the gravest security crisis on the European continent since World War II.”  Bush, who presided for eight long years in the disastrous War on Terror, bellowed like a Puritan preacher that he condemns Vladimir Putin’s “unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine.”“The American government and people must stand in solidarity with … the Ukrainian people as they seek freedom and the right to choose their own future,” he added from the pulpit.While it might be true that the quickly unraveling events in Ukraine represent the “gravest security crisis” since the last world war, it is simply naïve to believe that so-called ‘Russian aggression’ is solely responsible for that grim state of affairs. Indeed, it would be disingenuous to discuss the tragedy now unfolding in Ukraine without including a 12-inch-long footnote on US-led NATO, the 30-member military bloc that is now, to put it in more anthropomorphic terms, ‘kissing Russia’s border’. Putin spoke out against these unwanted advances back in 2007 at the Munich Security Conference when he pointedly asked Western leaders “against whom is this expansion intended?” Instead of providing an acceptable answer, NATO opted to grow its membership by another four countries.  Then, without an ounce of self-awareness, Bush proclaimed that the Ukrainian people have a right to “choose their own future.” While few people would argue against such modern common sense, where was that judicious counsel back in 2014, when high-ranking US officials like Victoria Nuland and John McCain were literally on the ground in Kiev, fomenting the fires of political strife that ultimately ended with democratically-elected president Viktor Yanukovych forced from office and replaced with US-backed Petro Poroshenko? While people will argue for years to come over Russia’s eventual course of action, which took much of the world by surprise, it cannot be denied that Western meddling in Ukrainian affairs helped to bring the situation to a boil.This failure to appreciate the complexity of the situation from Moscow’s perspective was obvious in another gratuitous lecture to Russia, this one courtesy of the former UK prime minister, Tony Blair. Writing in the Daily Mail, Blair kicked off his warmed over clichés with some cheap Nazi analogies (“Hitler led a Europe-wide fascist movement. Putin’s war is a one-man mission”) before arguing that the West needs to “increase the supply of weapons to Ukraine, particularly its SAM (surface-to-air missile) capacity – and give a commitment that arming Ukraine will be ongoing.”Clearly, Western leaders seem totally committed to courageously fighting the Russians down to every last Ukrainian.More to the point, haven’t we learned from past disasters that leaders like Blair and Bush simply cannot be trusted?As early as 1999, Tony Blair already had blood on his hands, figuratively speaking, in the Kosovo War, which saw NATO forces attack Yugoslavia without a mandate from the UN Security Council. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, some 500 Yugoslav civilians were killed over the course of the relentless 78-day NATO bombardment, which even managed to hit the Chinese Embassy, resulting in three deaths.Disastrous as it was, the Kosovo War was just a dress rehearsal for one of the greatest humanitarian crises of modern times – the 2003 Iraq War. Amid some of the largest protests ever recorded, throngs ascended on capitals around the planet in a last-ditch effort to halt Bush and Blair’s march to war after accusing President Saddam Hussein – without a shred of evidence – of harboring weapons of mass destruction. In Rome, a crowd of three million gathered on February 15, 2003 to protest against the impending invasion, a feat that got the Italian capital entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for ‘largest anti-war rally’. Bush and Blair arrogantly ignored this display of democracy in action, however, commencing with a ‘shock and awe’ campaign against Baghdad on March 19, 2003. To paraphrase Mark Twain, truth was still lacing up its boots while the Iraqi people were dying from outright lies, no thanks to a corporate-owned media industrial complex that refused to challenge the WMD claims until much later.Responding to revelations that the American and British leaders had essentially lied their way into the Iraq War, the writer Michael Massing proposed a very good question to journalists after the dust had finally settled: Why didn’t the mainstream media tell us more “about these deceptions and concealments in the months when the administration was pressing its case for regime change – when, in short, it might have made a difference?”Not until the publication of the Iraq Inquiry in 2016, long after some one million Iraqis had been displaced, killed, and injured as a result of the illicit invasion, was it determined that “the UK chose to join the invasion of Iraq before the peaceful options for disarmament had been exhausted. Military action at that time was not a last resort.”In addition to finding that Blair had “deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by the Iraqi regime,” the Chilcot inquiry revealed a private letter sent to George W. Bush from the UK prime minister that stated, “I will be with you, whatever.” With those words it is a bit easier to understand why Blair was dubbed “Bush’s poodle” in less supportive circles.On a personal note, I believe that Russia, which has been forced to watch its ‘near afar’ transform practically overnight into a NATO training ground, is politically mature enough to discuss its controversial actions in Ukraine with just about anyone. However, when the conversation has all the hallmarks of a censored social media post, which permits pot shots and apparently even calls for violence against Russians, then the discussion will not get very far.At the same time, Western leaders, both present and past, are certainly in no position to lecture Russia on its current behavior, whatever one may think about it. In fact, Western leaders, who ignored Moscow’s warnings for decades, must take their share of responsibility for the turmoil that is now happening in Ukraine. Only once they admit that to themselves will Russia, Ukraine, and the West be able to turn the page on this horrible chapter in its relations and move on. "

Russia attacked Ukraine on February 24, advancing on Kiev and other cities.Appearing on CBS News’ Face the Nation on Sunday, Qin said China will not send weapons or ammunition to Russia or Ukraine. “We will do everything to de-escalate the crisis,” he added.Beijing has refused to condemn Moscow for its military campaign in Ukraine and, unlike many Western countries and some of their allies, did not impose any sanctions on Russia. Beijing’s defiant stance prompted the White House to warn of “consequences” should it help Moscow to bypass sanctions in any way.Qin noted that China continues to maintain “normal” economic relations with Russia in all spheres, including the economy. Condemning Moscow will not help to achieve peace, he argued.“On the one hand, China upholds the UN purposes and principles, including the respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including Ukraine,” the diplomat said. “On the other hand, we do see that there is a complexity in the history of the Ukraine issue.”“China has good relations with Russia, has good relations with Ukraine, and China keeps close communications with the United States and with Europe. They enable China to reach out to all parties concerned in a crisis,” Qin said, adding that Beijing’s “unique role” can help to resolve the crisis.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

Just 9% of Democrats were opposed to any involvement at all, compared to 14% in a survey just prior to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine. 40% say the U.S. should take a major role in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, up from 26% in February. https://t.co/Y83mcxvQu3pic.twitter.com/s17oit4ryZStill, GOP voters largely backed some form of American participation, with only 15% saying they are against all intervention, while 35% suggested a major role.Significant majorities said they favored the provision of humanitarian aid to Ukraine (82%), taking in refugees from the country (67%), as well as “providing weapons” to the government in Kiev (64%), even as 47% of respondents voiced “extreme” concern about the risk of direct conflict with Russia. The poll did not ask about other forms of intervention, however, including a US-backed no-fly zone – an idea repeatedly proposed by Ukraine itself – or a troop deployment.The survey indicated widespread support for retaliatory sanctions on Moscow, with 68% approving “sanctions in general” and an even greater number (70%) backing a full-blown ban on Russian oil imports. A majority (55%) said they favored the penalties even if they inflict “damage” to the US economy, though a large plurality of 42% argued that “limiting” such blowback should be a priority.While the White House has imposed a series of sweeping measures to “isolate” the Russian economy and approved hundreds of millions in weapons shipments for Ukraine in recent weeks, it has made efforts to avoid becoming a direct party to the conflict. US officials have repeatedly explained that a no-fly zone is liable to spark a third world war, and have been hesitant to openly support major arms transfers to Kiev, such as fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles, instead largely supplying shoulder-fired missiles, ammunition, and other forms of “lethal” aid.Moscow attacked the neighboring state in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

Biden earlier appeared to call for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s removal from power, before walking back the statement, then making it again.“A lot of times when you’re around somebody who’s in cognitive decline, you find yourself trying to help them with a sentence, trying to help them complete it,” Paul told Fox News host Jesse Watters on Monday evening, adding that “we shouldn’t have to do that for the commander-in-chief.”Earlier on Monday, Biden told reporters that he “was not articulating a change in policy” when he called Putin a “butcher” who “cannot remain in power” during a visit to Poland over the weekend. Despite assuring the press that he wasn’t demanding regime change in Moscow, Biden then said again that Putin “shouldn’t be in power.”Biden read from pre-prepared cue cards during the press conference.“It is actually a national security risk because he’s sending signals that no one in their right mind would want to send to Russia at this point,” Paul continued. “We aren't trying to replace Putin in Russia. We aren’t trying to have regime change. We’re not sending troops into Ukraine, and we’re not going to respond in kind with chemical weapons,” he stated, referring to two other statements that Biden made and the White House walked back.These statements involved Biden seemingly telling US soldiers that they would be deployed to Ukraine, and that the US would “respond in kind” to a hypothetical Russian use of chemical weapons on the battlefield. Both actions would result in open war between the US and Russia, something that Biden has repeatedly said he wished to avoid.“So I do think that it is a real problem, and there’s a humorous angle to this,” Paul said. “But it’s really not funny because we’re worried about what he’s saying, precipitating or escalating the conflict in Ukraine into a world war. That’s very serious.”While Paul has condemned Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine, the Kentucky Republican opposes any US involvement in the conflict. Prior to Russia’s attack, Paul insisted that Ukraine “should not and cannot be our problem to solve,” and that the country’s accession into the NATO alliance – which the US and her allies insist is its right –  would be “a recipe for war and disaster.”Paul’s plea for temperance echoes that of French President Emmanuel Macron, who said on Sunday that he “wouldn’t use such words” to describe Putin, and that his main goal regarding Ukraine is “achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of [Russian] troops by diplomatic means.”“If we want to do that, we can’t escalate, either in words or actions,” Macron told the broadcaster France 3."

He also expressed support for German companies still operating in the country.Hermes said, as quoted by Reuters, that there are a number of sectors “in which further economic activity is not only lawful but also legitimate.”According to him, “Russia, like Ukraine, supplies the world market with much-needed agricultural products such as grain… Sanctions in this area would lead to further shortages and price increases, and hit the poorest countries in particular.”The lobby group’s chairman noted that there is also the matter of German companies’ responsibility for their 280,000 employees in Russia.“A sale of production facilities is hardly possible at the present time and would play into the hands of market participants from countries that do not implement sanctions against Russia,” Hermes said.He explained that there are also threats ranging from contractual penalties to the complete loss of assets and legal consequences for senior employees. “We therefore firmly reject blanket condemnation of companies that are still active on the Russian market,” Hermes said.As part of Western economic sanctions, foreign companies have been pressured to leave Russia. However, some of them, including Germany’s Bayer, have decided to stay.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

Not one word referred to her actual tarnished record of promoting American imperialism and criminal wars.,"Now, of course, the Western media would never tend towards such truthful reporting and analysis. Its sanitizing role is constant and standard fare. That is why the Western public is caught up today in this insane moral panic and hypocrisy over the war in Ukraine where Russia is vilified as an unprovoked aggressor and the Kiev Nazi regime (with its Jewish puppet president) is lionized as some kind of innocent victim. The widespread Western public ignorance over what is happening in Ukraine – the violent background to the present conflict, the CIA coup in 2014, the Nazi paramilitaries attacking Russian-speaking people in the Donbass, the relentless NATO weaponizing of the Russophobic regime, training of its Nazi paramilitaries by NATO troops and so on – is largely due to the Western media’s systematic lying, omission, and distortion. However, the brain-dead function of the Western media is especially highlighted this week by the death of Madeleine Albright and the total silence about how her career is tightly entwined with today’s conflict. The war in Ukraine is but the front line of a wider proxy war between the United States, NATO and Russia. The former US Secretary of State was one of the main pushers in the American foreign policy establishment of NATO’s eastward expansion. Several eminent US thinkers such as Jack Matlock, the former ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Professor John Mearsheimer, have deplored that expansion as a treacherous, fateful act leading to today’s conflict between the West and Russia. When Albright was Secretary of State in the second Bill Clinton administration (1997-2001), she ushered in the eastward advance of NATO in spite of earlier American assurances to the contrary to Russian leaders. Her most salient “achievement” was to launch the US and NATO war on former Yugoslavia. That war was supposedly in defense of Kosovo-Albanians. But it was really an overture for US imperialism to bomb European countries into the geopolitical shape it desired. Albright died on March 23 at the age of 84 from cancer. The next day, March 24, marked the 23rd anniversary of the beginning of the US-led NATO blitzkrieg on Serbia and its capital Belgrade. Russia’s intervention in Ukraine is arguably founded on the principle of self-defense given the NATO-backed Kiev regime’s eight years of aggression. That military incursion has been going on for four weeks as of March 24. There have been reportedly 1,400 Russian aerial strike sorties in Ukraine. Despite Western media hysterical reporting about alleged indiscriminate Russian bombing against civilian centers, the Pentagon has quietly admitted and corroborated what Moscow has said, that the Russian campaign has been restrained in order to avoid civilian casualties, as reported by Joe Lauria for Consortium News. Contrast that with the US-led NATO attack on the former Yugoslavia. That war lasted for 78 days during which 10,500 strike sorties were carried out. Some 2,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed. Civilian infrastructure destroyed included 25,000 homes, 20 hospitals, 70 schools, 38 bridges, over 1,000 kilometers of road and railway, 14 airports, as well as water, sewage and power plants. Western media decry Russia’s intervention in Ukraine as the “worst” act of barbarity in Europe since World War Two. Clearly, that is a gross distortion. The barbarism of the US and NATO in Yugoslavia has been consigned to a memory hole, as far as Western media is concerned. Madeleine Albright paved the way for the 1999 criminal US war in Europe. The NATO operation did not have any authorization from the UN Security Council even for its pretense of “defending human rights”. The war against the former Yugoslavia was a naked act of aggression. Albright was the architect of that war. At another time she declared the US had the right to use violence unilaterally because it was “an indispensable nation”. The path to today’s dangerous proxy conflict between the US-led NATO alliance and Russia can be traced back to the policy formulated by Madeleine Albright and like-minded imperialists in Washington. The destruction of Yugoslavia 23 years ago under her watch has culminated in the present near-war situation between the US and Russia due to relentless and reckless NATO expansionism all the way to Russia’s borders, including the weaponization of a Nazi regime in Ukraine. It should be seen as incredible that her nefarious, paramount relevance for today’s crisis should be so blatantly omitted in Western media. All we can read about her this week were eulogies to Albright’s “brilliant” diplomacy and being an icon for female achievement. That such a glaring omission can be made at this critically important time just shows the noxious propaganda function of Western media. Totally brain-dead. Meanwhile, alternative critical media have been blacked out as “Russian propaganda”. The brain-dead function of Western media is what makes the danger of war even greater. "

In the second segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Kayla Popouchet, a Peruvian-Haitian worker, student, and anti-imperialist to discuss the release of former Peruvian dictator Alberto Fujimori from prison, the crimes against humanity that Fujimori carried out as president and was convicted of, the corrupt political games that were originally played with his release by former Peruvian officials have set the stage for this release, and how this fits into the right-wing assault against current Peruvian President Pedro Castillo. In the third segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Karleigh Webb, an athlete, activist, journalist, socialist, contributor to @Outsports and host of the TransSporter Room to discuss Lia Thomas’ historic victory as the first transgender athlete to win an NCAA championship in Division I history and the intense transphobic backlash that has followed her victory, how the demonization of Lia Thomas fits into the broader right-wing assault on LGBTQ people and the caricature they paint of transgender women, and how these transphobic attacks have already been used against cisgender women and how they will continue to be used to demonize cisgender women. Later in the show, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Dr. Gerald Horne, Moores Professor of History and African American Studies at the University of Houston, and author of dozens of books, including his upcoming piece “The Counter-Revolution of 1836: Texas Slavery &amp; Jim Crow and the Roots of U.S. Fascism” to discuss the reorientation of US economic imperialism following the consequences of its actions against Russia and what it means for the future of the global economic system, the censorship of anti-war voices and the 24/7 nature of the propaganda cycle pushing for further NATO aggression in Ukraine, and the bloodthirsty desire of the US and NATO to fight Russia down to the last Ukrainian.

So far, I think it’s not only confusing for me. No one knows what awaits us, so I will look at the situation,” said the Beijing gold medalist, who turned 18 on Monday. “For now, I just want to take a break from this season and recover, because although it was successful, with bright moments, it was difficult for everyone.“I want to take a breather, and then we will already make a decision closer to the new season.”When asked if the uncertain future for Russian participation at international events would be a factor in her decision, Shcherbakova replied: “Perhaps it will directly affect my decision, yes.”Should she end up retiring, Shcherbakova would do so as an Olympic and world champion, a three-time Russian champion, and a two-time European silver medalist – all of which she has achieved under the tutelage of the renowned Eteri Tutberidze.  Commenting on that possibility, veteran coaching icon Tatiana Tarasova said Shcherbakova was a “mature” skater who knows her own mind.“Anna is a smart and mature athlete. She knows what to say and how to behave. She speaks frankly. It’s up to her and her coach,” Tarasova told Championat.Those words were echoed by former world ice dance champion Ilia Averbukh.“Anna is a smart girl. She doesn’t speak lightly,” said the Olympic medalist-turned-trainer. “I’m sure she’s very tired after two seasons.“Shcherbakova has convincingly won all the tournaments there are in figure skating.“I don’t think these are [her] final words, but in any case, Anya is a great figure skater who has gone down in the history of figure skating.“If she continues to skate, we’ll be happy, if she finishes her career, we’ll always support her.”With her triumph in Beijing, Shcherbakova made it three successive Olympic women’s figure skating singles titles for Russian contenders.After claiming gold at the Sochi Games in 2014, Adelina Sotnikova formally announced her retirement in 2020, although she had not competed professionally since the 2015-16 season.Alina Zagitova won gold for Russia at the PyeongChang 2018 Games and went on to clinch the 2019 world title, before announcing a career hiatus in December of the same year.Zagitova, 19, has since concentrated on her studies as well as exhibition performances and various roles on Russian TV.  "

Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the Donbass by force."

Instead, Delhi has called for a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis.","Dozens of members of the Hindu Sena, a Hindu organisation, took out a march in the Gwalior district of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh on Thursday in support of Russia amid its ongoing military operation in Ukraine. Hindu Sena's national president, Vishnu Gupta, and other members criticised Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and said he is the enemy of his own country. Condemning Kiev authorities for handing out weapons to civilians ""to fight their fascist war"", Gupta said that Zelensky ""keeps asking for more and more weapons but not once has he appealed for humanitarian aid for the Ukrainians"". ""The Ukrainian military has killed Russian officers and their negotiator, and yet they call themselves the victims. So far, Ukrainians don't seem to show any intention of stopping the war,"" Gupta said. The members were holding placards in support of Russia and India-Russia relations along with the national flags of the two countries. Gupta blamed the US and his allies for escalating the situation ""by unnecessarily interfering in two countries' bilateral ties"". ""The western world and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) must stop their proxy war against Russia endangering the civilian population of Ukraine and Russia."" The Hindu Sena's national president also accused Ukrainian authorities of blackmail as India had abstained from voting on a US-sponsored UN Security Council resolution that condemned Russia's special operation in February. ""India or any other country abstaining from voting, as a sovereign nation, has every right to take a stand according to its interests and relationship and no country or its citizens have the right to humiliate and beat up other citizens. It was very disturbing to see the Ukraine representative at the UNSC meeting openly arm-twisting and blackmailing India by holding our students hostage, so we vote in their favour. Later, many media reports surfaced of discrimination and humiliation in the FACIST &amp; RACIST Ukraine. There are also reports of shooting foreign students trying to leave Ukraine,"" he said. Indian students that were stuck in different parts of Ukraine accused Ukrainian security forces and border officials of racist treatment as they attempted to flee the country. ""No media is talking about Ukraine changing its constitution to exclude the Russian-speaking population and is doing ethnic cleansing of Russians in Ukraine, something that western media has wrongfully accused India of doing in Kashmir for years."" Gupta said that western media has consistently spread pro-Ukraine propaganda and fake news against Russia. He also stressed that Russia has every right to take necessary action to safeguard its borders, adding that India will always support Russia, ""as Russia has always been a true friend of India"". On 24 February, Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine after the newly recognised breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian aggression. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had made the tough decision to start the operation to stop the genocide of the Donbass population which the Kiev regime had been waging for eight years. "

The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocols were designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Another goal of the military operation is to “denazify” the country, according to Moscow. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."

","Great Britain has imposed sanctions against the head of Sputnik news agency, Anton Anisimov. London has also slapped sanctions against the ""Rossiya Segodnya"" International News Agency. Sanctions have also been imposed against journalist and TV presenter Sergey Brilev, Managing Director of RT Alexey Nikolov, and former head of the Russian communications watchdog Aleksandr Zharov. ""Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has announced 14 new sanctions today (Thursday 31 March) on Russian propagandists and state media who spread lies and deceit about [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine,"" the government said in a statement. According to a document released by Britain, the head of the National Defence Management Centre of the Russian Federation Mikhail Mizintsev has been sanctioned as well.  Anisimov said he cheered up when he learned about the sanctions being imposed against him. Since the beginning of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, Britain has imposed several packages of sanctions against Russia, targeting the country's financial institutions and individuals' bank accounts in Britain. In addition to economic measures, London banned Russian ships from UK ports.  Russia started its special operation in Ukraine following calls from the country's breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk to protect their civilians amid intensified shelling by Kiev's forces. According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, another key goal of the operation is to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine, where numerous radical neo-Nazi battalions have been actively participating in the Donbass conflict, presenting a threat to the Russian-speaking civilian population.

","The relations between the United States and Russia are on the verge of rupture, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warned on Tuesday.  ""Yesterday, a note of protest, which stressed that what is happening has put the relations on the verge of rupture, was handed over to the American ambassador. There is nothing more than what was said there"", Ryabkov said. The diplomat emphasised that whether bilateral ties will be severed depends on the course Washington chooses. At the same time, he said that if Washington manages to have a positive impact Kiev, which he doubts will happen, ""then there will generally be a certain prospect for normalising relations"". The deputy foreign minister reiterated that sanctions or US pressure will have zero influence on Russia's determination to complete the special military operation in Ukraine and protect Donbass. According to Ryabkov, Washington is fully responsible for the current level of Russia-US relations. Moscow urges the US to stop demonising Russia, the diplomat added. Relations between Russia and the United States can no longer develop the way they used to. The Russian deputy foreign minister also criticised the US for refusing a strategic stability dialogue with Russia. ""They have not confirmed their readiness to continue the dialogue on strategic stability,"" Ryabkov told the Rossiya 1 broadcaster, adding that Washington in time will realise that it has ""shot itself in the foot."" On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry handed a note of protest to US Ambassador John Sullivan, stressing that President Joe Biden's ""unacceptable"" remarks about Vladimir Putin have pushed bilateral relations to the brink of collapse. Biden called his Russian counterpart a ""war criminal"" amid the ongoing special op in Ukraine, a comment which Moscow lambasted as ""unworthy of a statesman of such high rank"". Speaking with reporters at the White House last week, Biden was asked whether he considers the Russian president to be a war criminal. After initially responding in the negative, Biden returned seconds later and clarified: ""I think he is a war criminal"". The diplomatic breakdown comes as the United States along with dozens of European nations have imposed several batches of sanctions against Russia, targeting its economy, space industry, financial institutions, businesses, etc., in response to Moscow's special military operation to demilitarise and “de-Nazify” Ukraine. The operation was authorised by President Vladimir Putin on 24 February following a request from the newly-recognised Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. The president stressed that the decision, as tough as it was, was made in order to protect the Donbass population, which has faced continued attacks and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years. "

It is noted that the most receptive to the speeches of Russian President Vladimir Putin were supporters of the Jean-Luc Melenchon, the presidential candidate of the left-wing La France Insoumise party, and presidential hopeful Eric Zemmour. The poll by Ifop was conducted during this week. On 24 February, Russia began a military operation to ""demilitarize and denazify Ukraine"" after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian forces.

The party concerned should respond to questions, and offer timely and comprehensive clarifications to remove the doubts of the international community,” Zhang added.We do not consider it too much to ask. And, on this issue, no double standards should be applied.Friday’s UNSC briefing was called by Russia, which shared the evidence obtained from laboratories across Ukraine. Moscow’s permanent representative to the UN, Vasily Nebenzia, argued that if the dangerous pathogens the laboratories were working on had leaked, the impact on Europe would be “difficult to imagine” and could have been worse than the Covid-19 pandemic, in comparison.According to a briefing by the Russian military on Thursday, the Pentagon-funded labs were working on “biological weapons components,” and may have been connected to suspicious outbreaks of dirofilariasis, tuberculosis and avian flu over the past several years. If the pathogens had gotten out of the labs, Nebenzia told the UN Security Council, “the scale of impact, including among the population of European countries, in this case is even difficult to imagine. It is possible that even the coronavirus epidemic could pale [in comparison] to this.”Washington has for years dismissed as “disinformation” Russian claims of biolabs in Ukraine, and said the US was only funding peaceful medical research there. Earlier this month, however, senior State Department official Victoria Nuland admitted that the US was concerned about Russia potentially taking control of the labs and their contents.Meanwhile, the UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu said that the world organization has neither the authority nor the ability to verify the data provided by Russia on the alleged US military biological program in Ukraine."

Britain has already sent thousands of anti-tank missiles into the war-torn country.“There’ll be more lethal aid going into Ukraine as a result of today. A number of countries have come forward either with new ideas or indeed more pledges of money,” Wallace told reporters after a donor conference in London aimed at increasing arms shipments to Kiev.Wallace said that Britain’s latest cache of weapons would include longer-range artillery, ammunition, and anti-air missiles.The UK has already donated more than 4,000 NLAW anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, at a cost of £20,000 ($26,300) per disposable unit.Earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his cabinet that he wants to send Kiev “more lethal” weapons, reportedly mentioning artillery, anti-ship missiles, and more advanced air defense systems. It is unclear whether the air defense systems mentioned by Johnson and Wallace would be shoulder-fired missiles, like the ‘Stinger’ units already sent by some NATO countries, or larger vehicle-mounted missile batteries.Sending the latter into Ukraine would pose problems of its own, as Russia has declared convoys of military equipment to be “legitimate targets” once on Ukrainian territory.The effectiveness of the weapons already sent by the UK is hotly debated. The Ukrainian government claims to have destroyed far more Russian equipment than Moscow records lost, while the Russian government says that its military operation is proceeding according to plan. Russian troops have successfully tied down Ukrainian forces near Kiev, and are now being withdrawn to concentrate on “the final stage of the operation” – defeating the Ukrainian military in the Donbass region, Moscow insisted on Wednesday.For the Ukrainian military, foreign arms shipments are essential, as the country’s defense industry has been “practically destroyed,” an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Alexey Arestovich, said this week.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

At a UN Security Council meeting, the Russian envoy said there is evidence of ""dangerous military-biological activities"" in the centre of Eastern Europe. Nebenzia said that the aftermath of these activities could have ""splashed out"" beyond the borders of not just Ukraine, but the entire region. The Russian Defence Ministry earlier accused the Pentagon of funding biological research in Ukraine in order to create bioweapons and conduct studies on the spread of dangerous infections and viruses.  The United States has called claims of US-funded biowarfare programmes in Ukraine ""false pretexts"" that are created ""in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions in Ukraine"". The statements from Washington came after Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said there were biological laboratories in Ukraine and added that the US was concerned about Russians possibly taking control over them. The Russian Defence Ministry, however, rolled out a handful of documents that, it said, pointed to the fact that components of biological weapons were being created in Ukraine with direct US involvement and financing.   According to the released documents, several top Ukrainian biolabs had received tens of millions of dollars to study infectious diseases, particularly looking into pathogens of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, leptospirosis and hantaviruses. In light of the military-biological activities in Ukraine, Russia may establish a consultation mechanism under the Biological Weapons Convention, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova noted earlier.  Russia, Ukraine and the United States are among the 183 countries that are party to the BTWC, which prohibits the development, acquisition, stockpiling and use of biological and toxic weapons. "

According to Roskomnadzor’s statement, access to the utility was restricted following a decision by the Prosecutor General’s Office.The regulator claimed that the “American online news resource provided access to numerous publications and materials containing unreliable socially significant information about the course of a special military operation on the territory of Ukraine.”Roskomnadzor noted in its statement that, according to a new Russian law, the public dissemination of “knowingly false” information about the actions of the Russian army was a criminal offense.Several days ago, it branded Google-owned video service YouTube “a weapon in the anti-Russia information war” and called on the company “to immediately stop any restrictions” against Russian media outlets which have been imposed on the platform.Since the launch of Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine, both Moscow and Kiev have gone to great lengths in their crusade against what each side calls “fake news.”The new Russian law, cited by Roskomnadzor, could see those found guilty of disseminating “knowingly false” information about Moscow’s military operation imprisoned for up to 15 years.Earlier, Roskomnadzor blocked access to several foreign media outlets, as well as domestic operators such as Ekho Moskvy radio and the Dozhd TV channel.Ukraine’s government, meanwhile, has outlawed 11 political parties, including the largest opposition grouping, Opposition Platform – For Life, for its alleged “connections” with Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky also signed a law introducing a “unified information policy” that enables the merger of all national news TV channels into a single “round-the-clock information marathon.”Russia and Ukraine have consistently blamed each other for spreading disinformation amid the ongoing conflict.Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and Russia’s recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk.

Russia has designated it a ""foreign agent,"" citing the concern's ties to Western intelligence agencies and its funding from the US, British and Dutch governments. “Bellingcat can confirm that three members of the delegation attending the peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on the night of 3 to 4 March 2022 experienced symptoms consistent with poisoning with chemical weapons,” the Dutch-based outfit then said.  Grozev said he couldn't get German experts to analyze the samples in time to show any traces of chemicals, according to the WSJ.Others have been skeptical of the claim as well. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhail Podolyak, who is involved in the talks, told Reuters “there is a lot of speculation, various conspiracy theories,” while Rustem Umerov, allegedly one of the people affected, said people should not trust “unverified information” and that he was fine. Abramovich has yet to officially address the report.The Russian oil magnate who bought the football club Chelsea was rumored to be involved in a “back channel” between the Kremlin and Kiev to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, but was placed on the Western sanctions list anyway."

Performing as the last of my team, I understood, like yesterday, that I couldn’t let the team down, that I wanted to complete it all beautifully.”Shcherbakova brushed off the incident with her nosebleed during her free skate routine, which was later dabbed clean by coach Tutberidze.“Everything’s fine. I’ve had this problem in training since childhood, so it’s not a problem at all,” said the star, who celebrates her 18th birthday on Monday.Elsewhere, the Channel One Cup marked a return to the ice for fellow teenage star Valieva after her Olympic dream turned sour in Beijing.Valieva produced a simplified free skate routine on Sunday compared to the program which has previously earned her a world record score, and included just one ultra-C element.Nonetheless, Valieva said she had been pleased to return after her Olympic travails.“I’m happy that the Channel One Cup took place,” said the 15-year-old. “A full arena, it’s out of this world. Thank you so much, it’s really energizing, it helps when you’re already tired.”Shcherbakova summed up the festive mood which meant the rivalry between the two compatriot teams was good-natured rather than overly competitive.  “It seems to me I wasn’t in competition with anyone here. I just went out [and] understood that this was the last event of the season,” said Shcherbakova.“I wanted to give all the spectators and fans pleasant emotions, so that after watching our performances, they would just be happy.”"
a4929a8e-62d9-4007-8966-6a5e602b065c,https://www.rt.com/russia/552943-biden-russia-regime-change/,Regime change has been the US goal in Russia for years,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.03/xxs/62436f7e85f5402b763c77ea.jpg,"For all the damage control that followed Biden’s ‘Putin cannot remain in power’ remark, that’s exactly what Washington wishes for","It was the culminating event of a four-day trip planned at the last minute for the purpose of rallying Europe to the cause of standing up to Russia’s military incursion into Ukraine. Speaking before a large and enthusiastic crowd in the Polish capital of Warsaw, US President Joe Biden concluded his remarks by going off-script. After condemning what he called his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin’s “brutality” in Ukraine, Biden uttered nine words that, in a blink of an eye, made moot whatever else had been accomplished on this trip: “For God’s sake, this man [Putin] cannot remain in power.”Biden departed the venue and headed straight for Air Force One, which was standing by to fly him back to the US. Before his plane could get off the ground, the White House was scrambling to contain the damage done by Biden’s most recent gaffe. “The President’s point,” an unnamed White House official explained to the press, “was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change.”When Biden arrived back in the US, he was asked if he was, in fact, calling for regime change in Moscow. Biden offered a terse one-word answer: “No.”But the off-the-cuff statement continued to haunt Biden, who was compelled to later offer a more detailed explanation for his outburst, telling the press “I was expressing the moral outrage I felt…[at] the actions of this man [i.e., Putin],” Biden said. “I wasn't then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change.”Biden later added that “Nobody believes I was talking about taking down Putin. Nobody believes that.”Apparently enough people were concerned about that very issue to prompt diplomats in the US and Europe to go into overdrive to explain otherwise. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared that the US had “repeatedly” stated that “we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia–or anywhere else. For us, it’s not about regime change,” he explained. “The Russian people have to decide who they want to lead them.”Josep Borrell, the EU’s chief diplomat, also stepped up to explain away Biden’s remarks. “[In the EU] we are not after a regime change, that is something for the Russian citizens to decide, if they of course could decide that.”Unfortunately for both Blinken and Borrell, the evidence seems to suggest otherwise. According to British journalist Niall Ferguson, a senior Biden administration official was quoted as saying, prior to Biden’s slip of the tongue, that in the aftermath of the Russian military incursion into Ukraine, “The only end game now is the end of Putin regime. Until then, all the time Putin stays, [Russia] will be a pariah state that will never be welcomed back into the community of nations.”Neither the sentiment (i.e., Putin has to go) nor the mechanism of regime change (that the Russian people will force him out) represent new thinking in terms of the West’s approach to the current Russian government. In fact, both are well known to Russia. According to Michael McFaul, the US Ambassador to Russia from 2012-2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that the US works hard to foster regime changes around the world, including in Russia, through the vehicle of so-called “color revolutions” or mass civil uprisings.Back in 2005, McFaul himself wrote an entire paper on US efforts at regime change in the former USSR. This was one of the reasons that President Barack Obama’s decision to send him to Moscow proved so unpopular with the Russian side.The Kremlin accused the US of engaging in such action in Russia following the December 2011 Russian Duma election, narrowly won by then-Prime Minister Putin’s party. At a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton following the 2011 Duma election, expressed her “serious concern about the conduct of the elections,” and called for a “full investigation of all reports of fraud and intimidation,” adding “The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted. And that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them.”Putin in turn accused Clinton of giving “the signal” to opposition leaders to undertake mass unrest to undermine the Russian elections. “[Opposition leaders] heard the signal and with the support of the US state department began active work,” Putin said after Clinton’s comments. “We are all grownups here. We all understand the organizers are acting according to a well-known scenario and in their own mercenary political interests.”McFaul underscored the concern on the part of Putin when it came to Clinton’s remarks. “He was genuinely worried about this mobilization against him,” McFaul said later, “and that’s when he pivoted hard against us. For Putin, this was confirming his theory of US foreign policy.”McFaul would know, given the fact that he was the architect of the so-called 'Russia reset' policy undertaken by the administration of President Barack Obama in 2009. The real purpose of this reset policy, however, was regime change–to facilitate the empowerment of President Dmitry Medvedev, the former prime minister who had swapped places with Putin in 2008 due to the Russian Constitution limiting Putin to two consecutive terms in office (the Constitution has since been amended), to permanently replace Putin as president. Under McFaul’s influence, the White House limited contact with Putin, placing all its attention on Medvedev. This full-court press for preventing Putin’s return to the Kremlin as president extended to Joe Biden, who at the time was Obama’s vice president.During a trip to Moscow in March 2011, Biden allegedly urged Putin not to seek reelection, telling a group of Russian opposition leaders that it would be better for Russia if Putin did not run for re-election next year. “At the end of the meeting,” Boris Nemtsov, a leading opposition figure who was murdered in Moscow on February 27, 2015, noted in his blog, “Biden said that in Putin’s place he would not stand for president in 2012 because this would be bad for the country and for himself.”Putin, of course, ignored Biden’s “advice,” and went on to re-take the presidency in the March 2012 election.The Russian government has long held that Western intelligence services had been using “democracy promotion” as a front to organize political opposition to Putin with the goal of removing him from office–i.e., regime change. One of the most public aspects of this effort was the discovery by Russia of a so-called “spy rock” used by the British intelligence agency, MI6, to communicate with its agents in Moscow. At the same time this object (in reality, a covert electronic device used to facilitate communications) was in operation, the Russian intelligence services were accusing the British of secretly funding Russian political opposition groups.Incidents such as the ‘spy rock’ led the Russian government to crack down on foreign-funded non-governmental organizations (NGOs), first passing laws which compelled groups that receive foreign funding and are deemed to engage in political activities to register as “foreign agents,” before barring NGOs altogether if they were deemed to pose a threat to Russia’s constitutional order, defense or security. The list of banned organizations included USAID, prompting the Obama administration to withdraw from the Civil Society Working Group of the US-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission. Thomas Melia, the group’s American co-chair, observed that the “recent steps taken by the Russian government to impose restrictions on civil society…called into serious question whether maintaining that mechanism was either useful or appropriate.” His sentiments were echoed by State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, who told the press that “the working group was not advancing the cause of civil society in Russia.”Left unspoken was the reality that what the US called “advancing the cause of civil society in Russia” was seen by Russia as little more than thinly disguised efforts at regime change through foreign-funded “color revolution.”While the overt and covert efforts of the US and its western allies to undermine and overthrow the Putin government by facilitating internal political opposition inside Russia took a hiatus during the four years of the Trump administration, the election of Joe Biden in 2020, and the advent of the current Ukraine crisis, has led to the re-engagement by the Biden administration to attempt to weaken Putin’s hold on power and, ultimately, to remove the long-serving Russian president from office.The Biden administration has taken to the artifice of speaking to the people of Russia directly to foment internal unrest inside Russia. “We know many of you want no part of this war,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently said, addressing the people of Russia. “You–like Ukrainians, like Americans, like people everywhere–want the same basic things: good jobs, clean air and water, the chance to raise your kids in safe neighborhoods, to send them to good schools, to give them better lives than you had. How in the world does President Putin’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine help you achieve any of these things?”Left unsaid was what Blinken expected the Russian people to do about it.Blinken’s comments followed those made by Joe Biden in the days leading up to the Russian military incursion into Ukraine when, on February 15, the US president addressed the Russian people directly: “To the citizens of Russia: You are not our enemy,” Biden said. “And I do not believe you want a bloody, destructive war against Ukraine–a country and a people with whom you share such deep ties of family, history, and culture.”The State Department has taken to sending out tweets in the Russian language encouraging public demonstrations against the war. “The open protest of Russians against President Putin and his war is a very courageous act,” one such tweet declares. “As President Biden said, the people of Russia are not our enemy. We blame this war on President Putin, not them.”The Biden administration has gone out of its way to make sure that its program of communicating directly to the Russian people to promote domestic discontent inside Russia is part and parcel of an overall strategy to remove Putin from office. Biden himself underscored in his February 15 remarks that “We do not seek to destabilize Russia.”But some in the US elite are, in fact, calling for the removal of Putin from power. “Is there a Brutus in Russia?” Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican (from South Carolina) known for his anti-Putin sentiment, wrote in a March 3 tweet. “Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military? The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out. You would be doing your country–and the world–a great service.”When called out for his tweet, Graham doubled down. “He [Putin] needs to be dealt with by the Russian people,” Graham said. “I’m not asking to invade Russia to take him out. I’m not asking to send American ground forces into Ukraine to fight the Russian army. I am asking the Russian people to rise up and end this reign of terror.”The Biden White House was quick to push back against Graham’s March 3 tweet. “No, we are not advocating for killing the leader of a foreign country or a regime change,” White House spokesperson Jen Psaki noted. “That is not the position of the United States government and certainly not a statement you’d hear come from the mouth of anybody working in this administration.”Then Joe Biden, the president of the United States, gave voice to that very same sentiment during his Warsaw address: “For God’s sake, this man [Putin] cannot remain in power.”There simply is no other way to spin that statement. Whether spoken or unspoken, it is clear to all that the official policy of the United States is, and has been since 2009, regime change in Moscow, using the forces of so-called “democratic reform” (i.e., mass unrest) to oust President Putin.Unfortunately for Biden, Blinken, Graham and their fellow regime-change travelers, an opinion poll from Levada (recognized as a foreign agent in Russia) showed that the Russian leader’s approval rating was over 71%. The chances of their regime-change fantasy coming true at this stage in the game are exactly zero."

According to Russia's top diplomat, Kiev's readiness to ensure a non-nuclear and non-bloc status of Ukraine is significant progress. He stressed that the Ukrainian side has also confirmed its understanding that the issues of Crimea, which rejoined Russia in 2014, and Donbass, which declared its independence from Ukraine the same year, are a done deal. Lavrov made the statement shortly after Russia's chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said that Tuesday's talks marked the first time that Kiev authorities expressed their readiness to negotiate with Moscow. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian delegation handed written proposals over to the Russian negotiating team, confirming their readiness for ""a neutral, non-aligned and non-nuclear status, along with a refusal to produce and deploy all types  of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and bacteriological ones, and a ban on the presence of foreign military bases and foreign troops on the territory of the country"", Medinsky said. The list of other Ukrainian proposals goes as follows: Medinsky stated that Kiev's proposals will be reviewed by Moscow and presented to President Vladimir Putin. The Russian side will also come up with a list of counter-proposals to Ukraine.  Over the course of the previous rounds of talks, the Russian and Ukrainian delegations managed to agree on humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from Ukrainian cities where the country’s military and nationalist battalions were fighting troops of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and  LPR), as well as Russian forces taking part in the special military operation. However, Kiev and neo-Nazi regiments have repeatedly sabotaged the evacuation process.  The Russian special op was launched on 24 February in response to an appeal from the DPR and LPR to defend them against continued attacks by Kiev's forces. "

","Sputnik correspondents have published the first video of the Mariupol airport, which was earlier liberated from Ukrainian forces and nationalist battalions, as part of Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. The footage taken from a drone shows trenches and craters near a runway, as well as bas-reliefs with mosaic of Lenin's mausoleum inside a terminal with broken windows, and a demolished control tower. This comes as Mariupol is gradually coming under the control of Russian troops and forces of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). The Russian Defence Ministry said last week that the humanitarian situation in Mariupol had reached catastrophic proportions due to Ukrainian nationalist battalions, who do not want to lay down their arms and prevent tens of thousands of civilians from leaving the city. On 24 February, Moscow launched a special military operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine after weeks of escalating shelling, sabotage, and sniper attacks by Ukrainian forces against the Donbass republics, whose predominantly Russian-speaking population has been subjected to ""abuse and genocide […] for eight years"", according to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Moscow has repeatedly stated that the goal of the operation is to neutralise Ukraine's military capacity and not harm the civilian population of the country. In April 2014, Mariupol was the second-largest city in DPR after Donetsk, but in June of that year, the Ukrainian security forces regained control of the area. On 7 March 2022, Alexander Semyonov, deputy commander of the DPR's Vostok battalion, said that the cleansing of some of Mariupol's districts from Ukrainian forces and nationalist battalions, including the Azov Regiment, had begun as part of the Russian special operation.

He told reporters on Sunday that the strikes were conducted on 19-20 March as part of the ongoing special Russian military operation in Ukraine, which aims to obliterate the country's military infrastructure with high-precision weapons. The Russian Defence Ministry spokesman added that the Ukrainian military used the base to supply fuel for its armoured vehicles stationed in combat areas in southern Ukraine. Konashenkov noted that since the beginning of the special operation in late February, 207 unmanned aerial vehicles, 1,467 tanks, and 148 multiple rocket launchers of the Ukrainian Army have been obliterated. Russian troops also eliminated 573 field artillery pieces and mortars, as well as 1,262 units of special military vehicles, according to him.

Have you seen that?” Rogan said to comedian Monty Franklin on his popular 'Joe Rogan Experience' podcast.“I offered my services. I texted him. I said, 'Dude I will arrange all of your training'. I said, 'I will arrange all your training'. It would be so f**king epic.”Asked what he would envision a Vladimir Putin vs. Elon Musk fight looking like, Rogan said that it would most likely have to take place under the ruleset of mixed martial arts.“I would say martial arts. You'd have to do martial arts,” said Rogan. “You'd have to, like, an MMA fight. It's 2022. Y'know, f**k the boxing.”One man who is backing Putin in the hypothetical matchup is Ramzan Kadyrov, head of the Chechen Republic.“Elon Musk, a word of advice,” Kadyrov wrote via translation on Telegram. “Don't measure your strength against that of Putin's. You're in two completely different leagues.”He added that Musk was little more than a ""businessman and a Twitter blogger”.This prompted Musk to revise his initial challenge.“If he is afraid to fight, I will agree to use only my left hand and I am not even left-handed,” he wrote.Thank you for the offer, but such excellent training would give me too much of an advantage. If he is afraid to fight, I will agree to use only my left hand and I am not even left-handed.ElonaMusk has been vocal in his opposition to Russia's military operations in Ukraine and has made available his Starlink global communications system in Ukraine in the weeks following the onset of the operation.The Kremlin has not responded to Musk's Twitter callout."

We are currently counting a good 200 such crimes a week, the majority of which are anti-Russian,” Holger Münch, the president of Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office, said.“We will continue to experience new highs in the area of politically motivated crime in the face of new social challenges,” the police chief concluded, in the same interview with German newspaper RND.Since the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine, there have been numerous reports of hate crimes against Russians across Europe. The offenses vary from insults and threats to physical assaults. She Russian-owned businesses have been vandalized and destroyed. Previously, international human-rights group Save the Children called out the bullying of Russian kids in Denmark. The activists say Russian kids have been abused at school and online due to their ethnic origin.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two regions by force.The US and most EU countries have responded to Moscow’s military action with severe backlash and sanctions. EU leaders have accused Russia of “an unprovoked and unjustified military invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine.”"

On Thursday, Washington targeted parliamentarians, dozens of defense enterprises, and a number of individuals, including the CEO of Russia’s biggest bank.In the latest bid “to impose severe costs on the Russian Federation for its illegal, unwarranted, and baseless war against Ukraine,” the Treasury has published a list of targeted entities and individuals whom it considers to be the “key enablers of the invasion.”“This includes dozens of Russian defense companies, 328 members of the Russian State Duma, and the head of Russia’s largest financial institution. This action aligns with similar actions taken by the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Canada, and reflects continued unity to hold [Russian President Vladimir] Putin accountable for his war of choice,” the department said in a statement.The parliamentarians have been targeted by the US sanctions for their support of “the Kremlin’s efforts to violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” including recognizing the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics.“In addition to designating 328 members of the State Duma today, OFAC is also designating the State Duma itself as an entity,” the Treasury said.The companies on the list, as the department claims, produce weapons “that have been used in Russia’s assault against Ukraine’s people, infrastructure and territory.” The 48 sanctioned enterprises include Tactical Missiles Corporation, High Precision Systems, Techmash, Russian Helicopters, and other related entities.Personal sanctions have covered, among others, Herman Gref, who was targeted as the head of Sberbank and as “a close Putin associate,” billionaire Gennady Timchenko and his relatives, and 17 board members of Sovcombank.Sovcombank has already responded to the news, saying the sanctions target individuals and therefore would not affect the bank operations.Any transactions with gold from the reserves of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation have also become subject to sanctions. This was done “to blunt the Central Bank’s ability to deploy international reserves, including gold, to prop up the Russian economy and fund Putin’s brutal war.”“The United States, with our partners and allies, is striking at the heart of Russia’s ability to finance and carry out its warfare and atrocities against Ukraine,” Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said.On Thursday, the UK announced its own sanctions against Russia and the EU's fifth package of restrictions was expected to follow soon. In the month that has passed since the launch of Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine, the US, along with its allies, have introduced several massive sanction packages against Moscow. The restrictions already personally affect the president, several top ministers, officials and businessmen, as well as a number of major banks, including Sberbank and VTB. Washington also imposed an embargo on Russian oil and gas imports and restricted the export of microelectronics and luxury goods to Russia. The US, EU, and their partners have cut the country off from their financial systems, limited dollar and euro transactions, and frozen roughly $300 billion in Russian forex reserves abroad, among other measures.Moscow considers the sanctions unjustified, inappropriate, and illegal and has pledged to take robust measures to defend the Russian economy.Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid. Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two Donbass republics by force."

What's more, Hunter Biden, the US president's son, has been implicated in financing the DoD's military biological programme in Ukraine.","There are more than 300 US-funded biological laboratories across the world, Anna Popova, head of the Russian consumer watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, has stated. She also noted that countries are building more such facilities against the background of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The remarks followed Russia’s Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov saying last week that Russian experts had revealed new facts pointing to the direct involvement of the US Department of Defence (DoD) in the development of biological weapon components in Ukraine. The main goal of this project was to conduct a molecular analysis of especially dangerous infections endemic to Ukraine, according to Konashenkov. He added that it was also revealed that a pharmaceutical company contracted by the Pentagon worked with the Ukrainian Defence Ministry to develop tests of unregistered medicines on Ukrainian military personnel. The remarks came after Igor Kirillov, the head of radiation, chemical, and biological defence of the Russian Armed Forces, said earlier this month that the total amount of US funding for military biological work carried out in the laboratories of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence amounted to $32 million. In a separate development, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that Russia will demand explanations about the involvement of the son of US President Joe Biden, Hunter, in financing biological laboratories in Ukraine that were tracked by Russian forces in the course of their ongoing special military operation in the country. The Russian Defence Ministry previously said that Hunter Biden’s investment fund was participating in financing the Pentagon’s military-biological programme in Ukraine. According to the ministry, the fund has significant financial resources in the amount of at least $2.4 billion. Moscow’s special operation to demilitarise and de-­Nazify Ukraine, which has been under way since 24 February, only aims to destroy the country’s military infrastructure with high-precision weapons, according to the Russian Defence Ministry.

The allegations were “part of information warfare” and “were certainly not true,” Peskov said.The claim of a poisoning plot as peace talks were taking place was reported by the Wall Street Journal and Bellingcat. The newspaper’s sources and the “citizen investigation” outlet claimed Abramovich and Ukrainian officials suffered from similar symptoms, which could have indicated a chemical weapons attack – or possibly a microwave weapon attack. The culprits presumably were “hardliners” in Russia wishing to sabotage the peace process. The government in Kiev appeared to have tacitly endorsed the poisoning narrative – at least as a hypothetical threat when speaking to Moscow. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he would advise “anyone going for negotiations in Russia not to eat or drink anything and preferably not to touch any surfaces.”The reported incident happened in Kiev in early March during a discussion that did not involve any Russian officials. It was reported ahead of a new round of Russian-Ukrainian talks hosted by Turkey, which was announced days in advance. US officials told Reuters they were skeptical about the claim and intelligence available to Washington indicated that the symptoms were environmental."

Japan claims four of Russia's Kuril Islands as its territory.Russia announced on Monday that it was suspending the talks regarding the Kurils and canceling visa-free trips for Japanese citizens to the islands. Moscow also suspended the talks on the joint economic development of the disputed territories.“Tokyo bares full responsibility for the damage to the bilateral relations and the interests of Japan itself because it deliberately chose an anti-Russian course instead of a mutually beneficial partnership and good-neighborhood policies,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s ex-president and the deputy chairman of the National Security Council, said that the peace treaty talks have become largely “ritualistic.”“Obviously, we would have never reached a consensus with the Japanese,” he wrote on social media on Tuesday, arguing that Tokyo was well aware of the situation. Medvedev added that, after amendments passed in 2020, the Russian Constitution bans giving any land away to foreign states, with the exception of minor border corrections. “This issue is settled,” the former president declared.Japan was among many countries that imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in response to its military campaign against Ukraine, with Tokyo announcing additional restrictions last week.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreement and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

After initially responding in the negative, Biden returned thirty seconds later and clarified: ""I think he is a war criminal"".","White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that Biden ""was speaking from his heart and speaking from what he's seen on television"" when he accused President Putin of committing unspecified war crimes. However, media outlets, even including those which have been largely sympathetic to the official US perspective on Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, like the Associated Press, have expressed doubts about the value of such rhetoric. As the article's author points out, declaring someone a war criminal is not as simple as just saying the words, and there are set definitions and processes for determining who's a war criminal and how they should be punished. The exact definition of ""war criminal"" continues to be hotly contested. Any prosecution of such claims would likely take place under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, but neither the US, Ukraine, nor Russia is a signatory to the 1998 Rome Statute which established the body. Nonetheless, on 2 March, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced he was launching an investigation into allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide committed in Ukraine. The investigation will cover the events that have transpired since 21 November 2013, the first day of protests which would morph into the right-wing US-backed ""Maidan"" coup d'état of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych that ultimately resulted in the deaths of over 14,000 people. On 4 March, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution calling for the establishment of a commission of inquiry tasked with ""investigating all alleged rights violations and abuses, and related crimes, and making recommendations on accountability measures"", according to UN News. Beyond questions of legal jurisdiction, the history of many of the governments currently accusing Russia of war crimes points to another potential problem, however. There are a number of offences that have been carried out by US and NATO forces over the past three decades that were also televised and which, using similar logic, would likely fall under the ICC definition of ""war crimes"". Officials close to the current US administration are implicated in many — in 1998, for example, the bombing of the Al Shifa factory in Khartoum, which produced over half of Sudan's pharmaceutical products, and which was ""taken out on the direct orders of Bill Clinton"", according to Jacobin. Other well-documented NATO transgressions have frequently gone under the radar in the West, and those rare corporate outlets which do acknowledge them often paint the attacks as ""claims"" or something their victims merely ""say"" happened.  ""NATO Bomb Said to Hit Belgrade Hospital"", read a Washington Post headline when the Dr Dragisa Misovic Hospital was reduced to rubble just two weeks after a US B-2 bomber carried out an airstrike on the nearby Chinese Embassy, killing three officials and injuring over 20. Seven people killed in a NATO airstrike on a Zliten hospital were reduced to a ""Qaddafi Government Accusation"" in a headline from US state-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. More recently, in a military operation under the leadership of then-Vice President Joe Biden, a US airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Afghanistan on 3 October 2015, killed 30 medical staff and patients. A subsequent Doctors Without Borders inquiry found the ""US knew site was safe from Taliban* but bombed it anyway"", as one headline from The Independent put it. The deadly attack on health workers was closely followed up by the bombing of the Abs Rural Hospital in Yemen on 15 August 2016, when US-manufactured Paveway-series aerial bombs were dropped by the Saudi-led, US/UK-backed coalition in what Amnesty international called ""the fourth attack in 10 months on a [Doctors Without Borders] facility in Yemen"". US and UK involvement in the ongoing Saudi siege of Yemen, which UN experts estimate has killed 377,000 civilians — 70% under the age of five — has largely gone unmentioned amid widespread Western allegations of Russian ""war crimes"". But the Biden administration's insistence that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a ""war criminal"" faces another serious hurdle internationally – Biden's own complicity in the bloody US war in Iraq that saw millions of Iraqis killed over the course of two decades ""Joe Biden did so much more than vote for the war"", according to University of Illinois–Chicago history professor Dr Barbara Ransby, in a recent mini-documentary narrated by Danny Glover, ""Worth the Price? Joe Biden and the Launch of the Iraq War"". ""It's questionable whether the authorisation to start the war could have even passed Congress without all that Biden did to get it approved"", she explained. ""He really did play a major role in bringing us into the Iraq War… He bears much more responsibility than many other senators who simply voted for it"". Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Back in 2007, Russia’s then-ambassador to the Central European country, Aleksey Fedotov, bestowed the Medal of Pushkin on the Czech politician for “bringing nations closer together and preserving their cultural heritage.” Klaus was the first Czech citizen to receive this award.In an interview with Czechia’s Lidovky news outlet published on Friday, Klaus said he considered “it childish to return this medal to someone demonstratively,” adding that such a gesture was something he “would not lower [himself] to.” He went on to proclaim that he “would have to be taken to the execution site to do something like that.”According to Klaus, the award in question was not “Putin’s medal,” but rather “Pushkin’s medal.” He argued that it had not even been President Vladimir Putin who had initiated the medal, but then-president Boris Yeltsin, as it had come into being back in 1999.He referenced what he described as “the cheap Russophobia that still exists today,” and denounced the sweeping “cancelation” of “Russian culture.”Speaking of the effects the war in Ukraine was having on the Czech Republic, Klaus opined that the influx of refugees would cost both the state and taxpayers much more than the Covid pandemic did.Since February 24, when, acting on Putin’s orders, Russian troops crossed the Ukrainian border, the country’s Foreign Ministry and several officials have reported cases of discrimination against Russian citizens in Europe, including in Czechia. According to the Russian media, Russian nationals have been the target of verbal and even physical attacks in the country.In a post on its official Facebook page on Thursday, Russia’s embassy in the Czech Republic warned that the extent of Russophobia had become dangerous, and cited a growing number of crimes targeting Russians. The diplomats said they had contacted the Czech authorities to request that they take appropriate measures.On Saturday, Aleksey Paramonov, the head of the first European department of Russia’s Foreign Ministry, described the current anti-Russian sentiment in Europe as “bordering on racism.”"

In an article brazenly titled, “Don’t confuse patriotism and Nazism”, FT appears to be whitewashing the Nazi battalion, citing a Vienna-based Ukrainian expert who claims today's Azov is not the same it was before. But, ironically, its commander's words state otherwise. Judging by his claim, it is the Azov leader who confuses patriotism with Nazism, and blindly believes being a nationalist is the same thing as being patriotic. Biletsky said that the Azov, founded by white supremacists, was “the spine of Mariupol’s defences,” adding that there were about 1,500 nationalists in the city and thousands more in total within the National Guard of Ukraine (NGU), including more than 1,000 in Kharkov. He added that there are also foreign nationals who are also fighting in the regiment. There is evidence of Azov members, who have engaged in hostilities against the people of Donbas, committing outright war crimes, including kidnapping, torture and mass looting, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reported in 2016. It has also been one of the primary tools used by the Kiev government in its crackdown against anti-Maidan protesters, who opposed the US-backed coup in Ukraine. The Russian envoy to the UN called on the international community to address the shocking crimes committed by nationalist battalions against its own civilians in Mariupol, which include torturing captives to death in cellars and carving swastikas into their dead bodies. But Western media have chosen to “gracefully” sidestep this unpleasant reality. "

One recent appeal asked for 1,000 man-portable anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles per day.The new bid outlines 17 priority items, including Switchblade kamikaze drones. The UAVs were included in President Joe Biden’s $800 million military aid package announced on March 16.The military planes requested by Kiev are Sukhoi Su-25s – jets originally produced by the USSR and later Russia. Ukraine inherited dozens of that type of aircraft during the collapse of the Soviet Union, but reportedly had just 17 still operational as of last year.CNN said, among other things, that Kiev is now seeking artillery systems, anti-ship missiles, optical surveillance equipment and planes to transport weapons. It also wants neighboring countries to provide logistical support to its armed forces by treating its wounded and repairing its damaged military hardware.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

The new requirement concerns countries that have imposed sanctions against Russia over its military operation in Ukraine.On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said “unfriendly countries” would continue to receive Russian natural gas in volumes and prices fixed in contracts, but are now to pay for the commodity in the country’s national currency. In Asia, these countries include Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, which import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Russia’s Sakhalin-2 and Yamal LNG projects.Commenting on the development, Japanese Finance Minister Shun’ichi Suzuki said that Tokyo is confused about Russia’s demand.“Frankly speaking, we do not yet fully understand the goals and how this will be carried out… the government is currently in discussions with the responsible ministries and agencies to assess the situation,” Suzuki stated.Japan is the biggest importer of Russian LNG in Asia, purchasing 6.84 million tons of liquefied gas from the country in 2021, according to Refinitiv data, which is nearly 9% of its total LNG imports.Suzuki noted that Tokyo’s decisions regarding further sanctions against Moscow will be made with consideration to their possible impact on the Japanese economy and financial markets. A number of the country’s major gas suppliers told Reuters they have not received notifications on changes to the currency of payment yet.Meanwhile, South Korea, Asia’s third-largest importer of Russian LNG, said it expects to be able to continue imports. The South Korean Financial Services Commission said it would do whatever was necessary to facilitate further trade with Russia.Taiwan also said it has so far received “no news that the payment system will be adjusted.” The country’s upcoming gas shipment from Russia is due at the end of the month.Analysts say Russia’s call for payments in rubles is a way to support the national currency, which plunged to record lows amid Ukraine-related sanctions. The ruble has jumped to a three-week high against the US dollar since the plan was announced.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

The inhumane acts are often attributed to nationalist and Neo-Nazi groups.","""Probably as any sane person, I'm simply terrified to see these horrors – in terms of lynching people, kicking them, trying to somehow smash their identity through tying them to the lampposts and painting their faces in the colour of the Ukrainian flag,"" says Adriel Kasonta, a London-based foreign affairs analyst and former chairman of the International Affairs Committee at the Bow Group think tank. ""This is terrifying, that is beyond any human being’s dignity, it's really terrifying to see these pictures."" Many reported atrocities are being committed by Ukrainian nationalists and the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion. Being incorporated into the National Guard in 2014 the group is subordinate to the Ukrainian authorities. The Azov Battalion, which openly wears the neo-Nazi Wolfsangel insignia, is notorious for attacking and displacing residents in eastern Ukraine, as well as raping and torturing detainees in Donbass, according to a 2016 UN report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OCHA). Incidents involving taping and whipping of Ukrainian civilians occur in areas where Ukrainian nationalists are most active: particularly, in Kharkov, Lvov, Cherkassy, and Dnepropetrovsk. Civilians are tied to electric poles or trees with tape, sometimes their faces are smeared with paint or green antiseptic dye, they are whipped and left in the cold. Photos of the victims and footage of the punishment are widely shared on social media networks. Among those targeted are the Roma people, one of Ukraine's ethnic minorities. One photo shows a Roma family, including children, being tied to a pole with their faces painted with green dye in the city of Lvov. There is no evidence that these people committed crimes, nor is there any provision in Ukrainian legislation authorising the use of such brutal methods of punishment. The Western mainstream media either remains silent about the ongoing arbitrariness or tries to portray the instances of the human rights abuse as local civilians' efforts to fight ""looters and bandits by themselves."" However, the discovery of a torture chamber in the basement of a building previously occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the village of Kryakovka, Lugansk region, tells another story. ""In this basement there was, so to speak, an impromptu torture chamber, from where we took a local resident tormented to death,"" said Lugansk People's Republic militia serviceman. ""There are traces of blood on the floor. Judging by the state of the body, he was shot in the head during the retreat."" Yet another infamous torture site codenamed ""Library"" was located in the International Airport of Mariupol, the Donetsk region. Documentary evidence indicated that the site belonged to the Azov Battalion. Those who disagreed with the policies of the Ukrainian authorities after the 2014 coup were detained, tortured and even killed there. ""It is astonishing and saddened that these facts are not loudly condemned by the various humanitarian NGOs in the West,"" says Tiberio Graziani, chairman at Vision &amp; Global Trends, International Institute for Global Analyses. However, according to Kasonta, everyone in the West is perfectly aware of what is happening in Ukraine and how Ukrainian nationalists, the Azov Battalion, and violent mobs are treating regular citizens and ethnic minorities in Ukraine. Racism and xenophobia have long penetrated into the fabric of Ukrainian society, according to the analyst. Thus, it comes as no surprise that African students were turned back by Ukrainian border guards while attempting to cross into Poland. “They stopped us at the border and told us that Blacks were not allowed. But we could see White people going through,” a Guinea student recalled as quoted by France 24 on 28 February. Meanwhile, the nationalist agenda became part of the Ukrainian education system. According to Ukrainian outlet STRANA.ua, the nationalist projects received up to half of all the funds allocated by the Ukrainian government for children's and youth organisations in 2020 alone. In March 2014, CNN admitted that ""far-right, anti-Semitic, anti-Russian, and openly fascist groups have existed and do exist as a blight on modern Ukraine."" Two years earlier the European Parliament's resolution denounced ""the rising nationalistic sentiment in Ukraine."" The Guardian quoted the Azov commander, Andriy Biletsky, as saying in 2010 that ""Ukraine's mission was to ""lead the white races of the world in a final crusade…against Semite-led Untermenschen [subhumans]."" While human rights have been weaponised and monopolised by the West, ""now the so-called human rights watchers are blind to the fact that human rights are being violated in Ukraine by Ukrainians, they are only concentrated on alleged crimes committed against Ukrainians by Russians,"" according to the foreign affairs analyst. ""This is very disturbing because it shows that the double standard is very clear, that we are not living in a world where we can objectively condemn someone, if someone is committing human rights violations,"" he says. ""But we are only supposed to condemn those who are labelled by the United States or the collective West as the human rights violators. This is not human rights, if human rights and international law are used arbitrarily by one state to condemn its enemies, then the international law or law at large is not serving its purpose. This is the double standard."" Regardless of Kiev's dark record of human rights abuses and xenophobia, the EU – which applauded Black Lives Matter anti-racism marches in summer 2020 – is backing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski's bid for membership stressing that ""Ukraine belongs to our European family.""

Let’s bring football home,"" the tweet continued.Attempting to clear this up, Johnson's official spokesperson said the PM ""was making a moral point that aggressors such as Russia should not be given a platform on the international stage, never mind the prestige of hosting a world-renowned sporting competition."" The UK & Ireland bid for the UEFA Euro 2028 has this government’s full backing.Our world-class stadiums and passionate fans stand ready to host one of the world’s greatest sporting events.Let’s bring football home. https://t.co/QWTL3muayA""This suggestion is a brazen and sorely misjudged intervention from Russia given their appalling actions in Ukraine. But clearly, we remain entirely committed to the UK and Ireland bid for Euro 2028, which retains the government’s support,"" the spokesperson insisted.Pushed on whether Johnson backed the UK and Ireland's bid, the spokesperson suggested reporters should ""look at the full clip"" while arguing ""the question was posed in the context of Russia being awarded the championship.""""Yes,"" the spokesperson claimed, when asked directly if Johnson was aware of his country and Ireland's bid. As for Russia's hopes of hosting in either 2028 or 2032, the Russian Football Union (RFU) has reportedly been warned by UEFA that further sanctions could be forthcoming despite there being nothing to stop it from submitting a declaration of interest.The Telegraph has claimed that UEFA is set to hold 'crisis talks' on how it should respond to the Russian bid.The RFU defended its right to express an interest in hosting events after the highly-successful 2018 World Cup, with RFU Executive Committee member Rustem Saymanov saying: ""We are open and ready, we should not be closed to UEFA and FIFA."" “We've held lots of competitions at a high level… There’s a lot of time, the situation will change, we will study everything,"" Saymanov vowed."

US President Joe Biden this month acknowledged that domestic inflation is a direct consequence of the west’s economic retaliation against Russia. A UK parliamentary committee warned on Wednesday that the British public wasn’t immune to the economic consequences of sanctions against Russia. The concerns of inflation and effect on markets are even more pressing in the developing economies like India and China. Both the Hang Seng (Hong Kong) and the Shanghai Composite Indices dropped to a 20-month low this month on account of the uncertainty created by the Ukrainian crisis. Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar warned in Parliament this month that the “Ukraine conflict has major economic implications.” “Its impact on energy and commodity prices is already visible. The disruption of the global supply chain is expected to be significant,” stated Jaishankar. Sputnik caught up with eminent Indian economist Dr Arun Kumar, who is presently the Malcolm S. Adiseshiah Chair Professor at the Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi. Kumar has also taught economics at India’s premier Jawaharlal Nehru University for over three decades until 2015. Sputnik: How effective, in your view, are the western sanctions against Russia? Will Russia be able to weather these western sanctions? Dr Arun Kumar: One must look at the effects of these economic sanctions in the short, medium and long-term. When one looks at the immediate impacts, the open global economic architecture, which involves trade and financial transactions, has been disrupted. In the immediate aftermath of these western sanctions, we saw the Russian currency rouble trading at a lower value, Moscow Stock Exchange dropping as well as reports of shortages of certain products in the Russian market. Importantly enough, Russian energy exports, including oil and natural gas, have been kept out of these sanctions. It is clear by now that the European Union (EU) can’t do without Russian oil and gas. Then, we have the possibility of China increasing its energy purchases from Russia in the near-future, since it has a massive requirement. In the case of India, we are seeing that even it has taken up offers of cheaper crude offered by Russia. I also don’t see Moscow facing any balance-of-payments crisis due to these sanctions in the future. At the same time, Russia’s trade account surplus will also enable it meet to weather these sanctions without much difficulty. Then, if one looks at the freezing of Russian Central Bank’s overseas funds, a point to note is the current trade account surplus enjoyed by Moscow. Technically, the central bank will continue to accrue interest due to this trade account surplus. Lastly, the western companies who are threatening to leave Russia can’t withdraw their capital or dissolve their holdings easily. A big question for the western companies would be to find buyers for their stake in order to leave Russia (The Moscow Stock Exchage is all set to re-open for trading on 24 March). Sputnik: Could these sanctions also prove to be counter-productive for the west as well as affect other nations? Dr Kumar: Russia has been a major global supplier of oil and natural gas, fertilisers as well as critical minerals such as palladium and nickel (used as an ingredient in stainless steel).  We are already witnessing anxiety among commodity traders and market analysts who have been anticipating rise in prices of fertilisers, energy as well as certain minerals such as palladium. I also envisage serious bottlenecks emerging in global supply chains due to disruptions caused by these sanctions. Another implication would be that developing nations like India will increasingly feel the pressure of joining either of the bloc.  Sputnik: Will the global economic growth suffer? Could we expect a rise in inflation? Dr Kumar: The factors that I have mentioned—shortage of raw materials, increased prices and supply side disruptions—will lead to inflation across the world in the short to medium term. Inflation means that the purchasing power parity (PPP) of households will also take a hit. These factors have the potential to affect the growth rate across major world economies. Sputnik: How would India be affected in these emerging economic realities? Dr Kumar: There will be inflation in all the major economies in at least the short-term and India is no exception (The Indian government marginally increased the fuel prices on 22 March after a gap of 137 days on back of record-high crude benchmark costs). But, then, one must take into account the role of speculators in driving up prices. Even though India is well-placed in terms of stockpiles, the domestic speculators are bound to speculate on the commodities market as a result of global food shortages. The government must remain alert to check the level of speculation on the Indian market in order to prevent the prices from rising. Sputnik: How can India respond to the economic crisis? Dr Kumar: As a response to the global economic effects, the best option for India will be to continue staying neutral, since it has major commercial dealings with both Russia and the US. With Russia, there is a strong defence component to the relationship that’s crucial for New Delhi. But a major challenge for Russia to sustain these economic ties with India would be how China views these relations between Moscow and New Delhi. If there is any Chinese pressure on Russia in the future as a result of increased economic reliance of Moscow on Beijing is what one has to wait and watch. However, India is also a major partner for America, at least as far as the Indo-Pacific region is concerned. One can expect increased pressure from the west on India to draw down its defence and other commercial ties with Moscow, as we are already seeing now. Sputnik: What are your thoughts about the prospect of establishing a rupee-rouble trading mechanism between Russia and India? How feasible is the proposal, should India want to deepen its energy and commercial ties with Moscow? Dr Kumar: The rupee-rouble trading mechanism had been in existence previously (during the Cold War era). We can carry out trade in our own currencies by choosing a reference point. Now, the complexity involved is in choosing the reference currency. Another factor here would be about the relative strength of rouble in non-dollar denominators, since the rouble may further drop vis-à-vis the dollar.  So, both the countries will have to develop a parity in non-dollar denominators in order to re-engage in rupee-rouble mechanism. "

The United States, Turkey and Israel intervened in the conflict and have dropped tens of thousands of bombs on the Middle Eastern nation since 2014.","The Ukrainian National Guard’s official Twitter handle posted and then deleted a tweet claiming Syria has only been bombed with 100 missiles over the past five years, and that Ukraine, by comparison, has been hit by 1,100 Russian missiles in 22 days. “Realize the scale of the disaster,” the tweet, which was screengrabbed by Press TV journalist Richard Medhurst before being disappeared, read. “This is part of the same mentality that Ukrainian refugees are more ‘civilized’ than Syrian ones. Apparently they’re even more ‘Christian’ (as if Christianity didn’t start in Palestine/Syria). And now they act like the destruction is also worse. Y’all don’t know when to stop huh,” Medhurst suggested. The journalist pointed out that Syria has been in a state of war for more than a decade, and that large swathes of its territory remain occupied by the US, Turkey and Israel, with over 350,000 Syrians killed, and millions more injured or becoming refugees, and suffering from the destruction of key infrastructure and historical and cultural artifacts. “The West already supports Ukraine. I don’t even understand what the point of posting this garbage is, or [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky going around making absurd comparisons to the Holocaust. This is so uncalled for. If the goal is to garner sympathy, it failed. A lot of people are rightfully angry,” Medhurst added. It’s not immediately clear where the Ukrainian National Guard got its figures from to create its graphic. In 2018, the United States, France and the UK launched more than 100 air and cruise missiles at Syria in the aftermath of a false-flag chemical attack in Douma. A year before that, the United States launched 59 Tomahawk missiles into Syria at an airbase, “in response to” a separate staged chemical attack blamed on the Syrian government. The US-led anti-Daesh coalition in Iraq and Syria has expended nearly 120,500 missiles and bombs over the two countries, 15,184 of them over the past five years, and 554 in the first year of the Biden presidency. Separately, Israel has admitted to bombing targets in Syria “hundreds” of times, while Turkish air raids have targeted Syrian Kurdish militia positions in the country’s north repeatedly in the wake of Ankara’s incursion into the country in 2016 and then again in 2018 and 2019. A Russian Defence Ministry summary of the military operation in Ukraine indicated Thursday that since the beginning of the operation on 24 February, Russian forces destroyed 257 Ukrainian drones, 202 anti-aircraft systems, over 1,500 tanks and other armoured vehicles, 160 multiple launch rocket systems, 633 pieces of field artillery and mortars, and 1,379 military vehicles. The MoD does not keep (public) tabs on exactly how many missiles and bombs have been expended to date. * Terrorist groups outlawed in Russia and many other countries. "

For now, we can only hope for the best. It will be, as you said, a triumph of justice and common sense [if Russia are reinstated]. Ideally, we should get the right to [contest] playoffs for getting into the World Cup.""Poland were given a bye and will host Sweden in Chorzow on Tuesday to decide who reaches the final.Karpin accepted that it ""is not for me to decide"" how the situation might be resolved if Russia's qualification bid is allowed to resume despite the finals places being finalized in their absence. The former international, who has jointly returned to his job at former club Rostov while the national side are in limbo, was pleased with a training camp Russia held this month and said he could call up stars playing in other countries next time.""Any coach is, in fact, a teacher. Continuing the analogy, I would like to educate talented students, to lay down the qualities that, in the opinion of our coaching staff, are necessary for modern football players,"" he philosophized.""And, of course, we all hope that Russia will be returned to the international arena and we will also face sports [challenges].“I thanked everyone for their work and asked them not to forget about our requirements. And, of course, I wished for us to gather again soon and prepare for official matches.""They were ready for this – they looked not weaker, but even stronger than before.""Following his appointment in July 2021, Karpin was only denied automatic qualification for the finals by a late Croatia goal in Russia's final qualification group match in Zagreb.The former Spartak Moscow manager said that Russia will not look for opponents until the CAS has made a final decision.Poland and the two teams Russia could have faced in the playoffs had publicly refused to play against them."

At this moment, the needs which we reported to the European Commission have amounted to 2 billion 200 million euros,” the official said.He added that Poland is not only “a spokesman” for the Ukrainians in Europe but also a country helping the refugees “here and now,” and thus it has all the grounds to apply for funds from the EU.” According to Pobozy, only 16 million euros have been allocated for his ministry so far to deal with the crisis, which was obviously not enough.“So far, Poland has not received any money for refugees from the European Commission,” he said. The deputy minister believes, however, that eventually his country will receive the requested funds. He emphasized, however, that if Poland waited for money to arrive before providing help to the refugees, there would by now be “a gigantic humanitarian catastrophe.” According to the latest data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the total number of refugees having fled Ukraine since the launch of Russia’s attack on February 24 exceeds 4 million. More than 2.3 million are now in Poland.Russia attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

The race has been tight so far, with the latest polls suggesting that Orban’s ruling Fidesz party is only leading the six-party alliance of opposition parties, United for Hungary, by 41% to 39%.“Constant negotiations are underway” between the Kiev authorities and the opponents of the Hungarian government, the FM insisted. Among other things, the opposition has already promised Ukraine to “immediately make a decision to supply weapons” to Ukraine, he added.Szijjarto reiterated that, as long as the current Hungarian government remains in power, there would be no deliveries of “lethal aid” to the neighboring country.  Unlike some other EU states, Hungary has refused to either send weapons to Kiev during its conflict with Russia or let other states move such shipments through its territory. Budapest also refused to support the new round of sanctions against Moscow, especially in the energy sector, arguing that they would do more harm to Hungary than to Russia.Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko has denied Szijjarto’s accusations of election meddling, calling on Budapest to stop trying to “involve Ukraine in domestic political struggle” and to cease attempts to exploit ""the sorrow of the Ukrainians.”Instead of trying to gain Russia’s approval, Hungary should focus on promoting unity within the EU and NATO, as its security depends on it too, he added.Moscow sent its troops to Ukraine in late February, following Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

Before that, the State Department moved to expel Sergei Trepelkov, Russia's second-ranking diplomat in Washington. Trepelkov was expelled after Russia kicked out US Embassy second-in-command Bart Gorman in response to the expulsion of yet another Russian diplomat from Washington. The US and Russian governments have engaged in tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats going back to the crisis in Ukraine in 2014. The practice was also common during the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union in the 20th century. Commenting on the Russian expulsion notice later Wednesday, State Department spokesman Ned Price said that the US Embassy serves as a ""locus of coordination and communication"" between the two countries, and that Washington does not want to see it ""closed down."" Russian-US relations hit a lowpoint unseen since the deepest depths of the Cold War last month after Moscow began a military operation in Ukraine aimed at ""demilitarizing"" the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead on the operation after weeks of escalating shelling, sniper and sabotage attacks by Ukrainian forces against the self-proclaimed Donbass republics, whose sovereignty Russia recognized on 21 February. The fighting in Ukraine is the culmination of a security crisis which began eight years ago, when US and EU-backed political forces overthrew Ukraine's unpopular but democratically elected government and proceeded to try to drag the heavily divided nation into the West's orbit. The coup in Kiev prompted Crimean authorities to organize a referendum on the peninsula's status, and sparked a civil conflict in the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk which effectively continues to this day.

The Russian mission also emphasized that the military had set up checkpoints for civilians leaving the zone of active hostilities and added that the Russian military seeks to ""carefully inspect vehicles heading to safe areas"" as a means of avoiding sabotage operations by Ukrainian national battalions.

Mizintsev added that ""all [testimony] will be investigated in detail."" Mizintsev continued that Kiev had ordered those national battalions to leave Mariupol in small groups under the guise of civilians, after Ukraine refused the offer to conduct a humanitarian operation in the city, declaring that it would never surrender to the Russian army. Russia launched a special military operation on February 24 in Ukraine as a response to pleas for protection from soldiers of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics.

According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the two countries represent 53% of global trade in sunflower oil and seeds and 27% in wheat.UNCTAD earlier said that all countries would inevitably be impacted by the conflict-generated crisis. Increases in food and fuel prices “will affect the most vulnerable in developing countries, putting pressure on the poorest households which spend the highest share of their income on food, resulting in hardship and hunger,” the organization warned.Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two Donbass republics by force."

In response to Russia’s offensive, Ukraine had placed anchor mines along its coastline, but a number have since detached from their cables and are adrift at sea, it said.“The Armed Forces of Ukraine have once again demonstrated a complete disregard for international law and for human lives, including those of citizens of the European Union,” the FSB said in a statement.According to the agency, after Russia launched a large-scale military operation against the country in late February, the Ukrainian Navy created a minefield outside each of the Black Sea ports of Odessa, Ochakov, Chernomorsk, and Yuzhny. The FSB claims the mines deployed are for naval or river use and were produced by the Soviet Union in the first part of the 20th century.“With the onset of stormy conditions, the cables connecting the mines with their bottom anchors began to break. The mines are now drifting freely in the western part of the Black Sea,” it said.The situation is likely to get even more hazardous, given the southward trajectory of the surface currents in the area, the FSB has warned. “It is not possible to rule out that the detached mines will drift into the Bosphorus and further into the Mediterranean Sea,” it added.Moscow attacked its neighbor following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of the breakaway regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

That is our principle,” Scholz said, speaking at a debate in the Bundestag. “We have to be very clear: [the crisis in Ukraine] may turn out not be a short-term issue, but a long-term confrontation. And we all have to get through it together. Therefore, Germany’s position on this issue remains unchanged. It’s also a fact that many [EU] member states are highly dependent on imports of oil, gas, coal, even more so than Germany. And no one should be left out in the cold in this regard,” Scholz said, explaining his government’s opposition to a total ban on Russian energy imports, as has been proposed by some EU members. At the same time, Scholz boasted that Europe and its partners have adopted the “toughest sanctions ever applied against such a large country”. These restrictions, he said, will hinder Russia’s economic development dramatically, with the economy “faltering” and hundreds of foreign companies leaving. “But that’s just the beginning,” he promised, saying sanctions will continue to be tightened. Scholz’s coalition government reportedly agreed on relief measures aimed to ease biting energy prices for German consumers on Tuesday. The measures are said to include a fuel price discount, an energy allowance and a temporary transport allowance. German media also reported on “out of control” price rises at major food retailers, with sunflower oil doubling in cost, mineral water, coffee and toilet paper up 10 percent, and dairy products up by five percent. On Wednesday, the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research predicted that inflation would reach an average of 6.1 percent in 2022, with growth expected to slow to between 2.2 and 3.1 percent – below the 3.7 percent previously predicted as the country continues to recover from Covid lockdowns. Russia and Ukraine’s status as major exporters of wheat and grain also mean increased food costs, according to the institute. Ifo calculates that German consumers will lose some 6 billion euros in purchasing power by the end of March alone. "

Why Anti-Russia Sanctions Have No Effect But to Inflict Pain on Everyone,https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/img/07e6/03/18/1094159333_0:0:3258:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_1be9a3eb978e38510596c6194ff130d4.jpg?source-sid=ap_photo,"The cost of bread, cereal, pizza, pasta and other foods in the US could spike, the Hill warned, five days after Joe Biden admitted, while predicting food shortages, that the price of sanctions imposed by the West upon Russia will inevitably backfire on ""an awful lot of countries"" including the US.","According to CNBC, the US and its allies are planning new sanctions on more sectors of Russia's economy because of Moscow's special operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine even though the restrictions already imposed have hit supply chains, disrupted deliveries of raw materials, sent energy prices higher and dealt a blow to agriculture. Since 28 February, the West has doubled down on isolating commodity-rich Russia from global finance. By 4 March, major international shipping groups - including container lines - ""suspended almost all cargo shipments to and from Russia to comply with western sanctions,"" according to Reuters, thus bringing a halt to Russia's deliveries to the global market of critical commodities, including fertilisers and wheat. The US' Russia energy ban and the EU's pledge to cut supplies of hydrocarbons from Russia have put a rocket under oil and gas prices. ""We did talk about food shortages,"" US President Joe Biden said on 24 March at a press conference in Brussels. ""And it’s going to be real. The price of these sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia, it’s imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well."" ""At the end of the day, America and Europe will feel the pain of deprivation from energy, minerals and food,"" says US independent journalist and geopolitical analyst Max Parry. ""Americans have not even begun to feel the true financial effects of the sanctions on Russia and their impact on the US economy which was already ravaged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inflation has been at a rate not seen since the Eighties and supply chain shortages were hurting America's pocketbooks. But now the Biden administration has just poured gasoline onto the fire by placing the most draconian sanctions ever on the Russian Federation which is one of the top world suppliers of fossil fuels as well as base metals that are indispensable to global industrial output."" Now US business owners also have the perfect excuse to blame rising prices on consumer goods, according to Parry. Similarly, the Biden administration is clearly trying to use the Ukraine crisis as an excuse for its poor handling of the American economy, he notes. At the same time, it is difficult to understand the motivations and inner logic of the foreign policy establishment in Washington especially when you consider that sanctions have seldom resulted in the desired outcome at any time in history, according to the analyst. To illustrate his point, Parry cites the fact that western sanctions, slapped on Moscow since 2014, failed to reverse Crimea's reunification with Russia and to prevent Russia ""from continuing to return to the world stage and stand up for its own interests"". Likewise, he says, the US' ""maximum pressure"" on Iran and oil embargo on Venezuela have not resulted in regime change or stopped those nations from integrating with Russia and China's economic infrastructure. It's unclear what the western sanctions are designed to achieve apart from ""making Russia bleed"": the restrictions do not appear to be aimed at halting the conflict as the US and its NATO allies are continuing to send lethal weapons to Ukraine while Moscow is locked in peace negotiations with Kiev. According to US observers, the ongoing weaponry supplies and controversial speculation about putting US boots in Ukraine makes Kiev less willing to negotiate and reach a compromise. Little if any support has been voiced by the West with regard to Moscow's peace effort. The latest progress in the Russo-Ukrainian Istanbul talks was immediately thrown into doubt by the western press, and the Pentagon rushed to express scepticism about Russia's military de-escalation near Kiev. ""Nothing has changed, Russia is just buying time with negotiations,"" claimed CNBC. What stuns Max Parry is that the American Left are not challenging the US mainstream narrative and largely turning a blind eye to the potential negative consequences of anti-Russia sanctions for ordinary Americans. Parry notes that the only Democrats to vote against the US' Russia oil embargo were Cori Bush and Ilhan Omar. Moreover, those Democrats who dare to speak against the established narrative get smeared immediately: ""Just look at the way former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard became persona non grata,"" the journalist notes. New York Representative Jamaal Bowman voted against sending more lethal aid to Ukraine and now is suddenly going to face a primary challenger who is a Kosovar Albanian-American legislator that is extremely pro-NATO, according to Parry. ""Unfortunately, there really is no political opposition to represent the interests of the American people on Capitol Hill when it comes to rapprochement with Russia,"" he says. ""Instead, lawmakers only ensure that the defence industry will continue to make huge profits off tensions between the two countries. Sure, some of them may have voted against additional military aid to Ukraine but when they've even shown any slight deviation from the anti-Russian orthodoxy they open themselves up to attack and risk their political career.""

The facility was sheltering some 400 civilians, primarily women, children and the elderly, the city’s council alleged on Sunday in a Telegram post.“Yesterday, the Russian occupiers dropped bombs on an art school No 12,” the council claimed. “It is known that the building was destroyed, and civilians are still under the rubble.”The council did not estimate the number of potential casualties resulting from the alleged school bombing. No footage from the scene corroborating the claim has emerged either, while the Russian military has remained silent on the matter.Earlier this week, Ukrainian authorities accused Moscow of bombing the Mariupol Drama Theater, initially claiming that over 1,000 civilians sheltering there had been killed. The Ukrainian account of the events, however, promptly changed as it turned out that over 200 civilians were rescued from the bomb shelter under the destroyed building, while no one was apparently killed in the incident.The Russian military denied targeting the theater altogether, pinning the blame for the bombing on neo-Nazi fighters with the notorious Azov regiment. Russian military spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov said that “reliable information” from locals indicated that the militants blew up the building themselves to frame Russia.Mariupol became the site of intense urban warfare after the southeastern Ukrainian city was cut off and encircled by Russian regular troops and those of the Donetsk People’s Republic.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

Speaking in Sunset, Louisiana on Monday, Harris mentioned “the significance of the passage of time” four times in the space of thirty seconds. Harris’ comments immediately went viral, amassing over 4.5 million views on a GOP-affiliated Twitter account and tens of thousands more on others. Sensing red meat, Republicans had a field day attacking Harris in a series of sarcastic ways. Former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich suggested Harris’ appearances in public were a “strong reason” to pray for President Biden’s health, given that she’s just one heartbeat away from the presidency. “She’s not only totally incoherent – you know, he may or may not have cognitive decline problems at this age, but at her age, she’s just dumb”, Gingrich said. The politician suggested that Harris should be barred from trips abroad, and that she should consider “never leaving the Naval Observatory” – her formal vice presidential residence, to avoid embarrassing the administration. Former Republican Senate aide Matt Whitlock compared Harris’ performance to HBO’s political cringe comedy show VEEP, suggesting that her comments were “the most VEEP thing we’ve seen in at least a few weeks” and tweeting a clip of the vice president’s comments overlaid with the show’s credits. “Is she actually drunk?” one podcaster asked. “Kamala Harris Fact: The Passage of Time is Slower When You’re High”, another joker quipped. The Louisiana speech isn’t the first time that Harris has been called out for her awkward, rambling and incoherent remarks. Last week, she raised eyebrows after laughing uncontrollably at a press conference with the Polish president after being asked a question about the crisis in Ukraine. Before that, when asked to break down the crisis in simple terms on an Atlanta radio show, Harris used her von Clausewitzian wit to explain that “Ukraine is a country in Europe” that “exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine so basically that’s wrong”. Harris’ gaffes, goofs, and slips have become so commonplace that entire compilations have been created online. The vice president’s approval rating dropped to a historically unprecedented low of 28 percent in November, behind even that of Dan Quayle and Dick Cheney at their lowest points. Harris has accused the media and Republicans of treating her with excessive scrutiny because of her race and gender. Biden selected Harris as his running mate in August 2020. Harris herself dropped out of the campaign in December 2019, before any primaries or caucuses were held, and received zero delegates for the Democratic nomination. "

The US and its allies imposed sanctions on Russia in response to the military operation in Ukraine.,"India's ONGC Videsh Ltd. (OVL), with a 20% stake in the Sakhalin-1 project, has sold crude oil to state refiners Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) in a fresh tender issued by the company last week. This is the first time HPCL and BPCL have purchased Sokol crude from Russia. Sources in New Delhi told Sputnik that the firms secured the cargo at a discounted price. The payment will be made in Indian rupees to the OVL. The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL), the country's largest refiner, purchased six million barrels of Russian Urals in March alone. Moscow has offered a roughly 30% discount compared to international prices. Industry sources also told Sputnik that Nayara Energy, the country's second-largest refiner, has placed an order to purchase 1.8 million barrels of Russian crude oil. The delivery is expected in May this year. ""India has to keep focusing on the competitive energy source"", the Indian government conveyed last week. Sources also told Sputnik that a detailed discussion between the two countries related to a rupee-ruble payment mechanism would be held during Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's visit to New Delhi later this week. The rupee-ruble mechanism will boost energy ties between the two countries, as Russia could start offering steel-making and thermal coal at discounted rates. The Reserve Bank of India met three Russian banks — Sberbank, VTB, and Gazprom Bank — and more such meetings with officials of these banks will be held this week. Western sanctions against Russia for its special military operation to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine have hit Russian energy sales, resulting in deep discount offers to energy buyers such as China and India that are not following the unilateral sanctions. India and China have called for an end to the violence in Ukraine and urged that the Ukrainian issue be solved diplomatically. The Biden administration said on 14 March that New Delhi would not be violating US sanctions by purchasing discounted Russian oil, but warned that ""support for the Russian leadership is support for an invasion that obviously is having a devastating impact"".

Since Russia and Ukraine are key crop suppliers in the world, the G7 leaders have blamed Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine for a looming crisis and are now discussing a package of measures to prevent food shortages.Nevertheless, in Putin’s opinion, the West continues to make decisions that “are pushing the global economy towards crisis,” leading to the disruption of production and logistics chains, an increase in global inflation, and the aggravation of inequality, to a decline in the living standards of millions of people, and to mass famine in the poorest countries. Putin accused the US of trying to solve its own problems at the expense of other countries and to shift the blame for its own economic mistakes onto Russia. Moreover, in the president’s opinion, the US is going to try to cash in on the current global instability, for example, by attempting “to push Europe towards expensive American liquid natural gas.”Putin added that all the sanctions which are being imposed on Moscow now “have been prepared in advance” and “would have been imposed in any case.” They are poised, according to the president, “to curb Russia’s development,” to undermine its sovereignty and to weaken its “industrial, financial and technological potential.”Taking into consideration the fact that the West has been imposing the restrictions against Russia for many years, there is no point thinking that this approach would change any time soon, Putin emphasized.The West strongly condemned Russia’s military attack on Ukraine, calling it “unlawful” and “unjustified,” and slapped Moscow with hard-hitting sanctions, covering many sectors of the Russian economy. The restrictions include Washington’s ban on energy imports, an international ban for the use of the SWIFT interbank messaging system, and personal sanctions against Putin. Hundreds of companies have suspended or completely halted their operations in Russia. In response, Moscow has included most of the Western countries in its list of “unfriendly states.” All of these countries are now subject to various retaliation measures, restrictions, and specific requirements from Russia. For example, Moscow now wants all “unfriendly” states to pay for gas supplies in rubles. Another retaliatory initiative saw the Finance Ministry requesting that Russian companies that want to work with firms from countries on the list receive government permission first.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

According to the outlet's sources, Academy decision-makers are still deciding how Zelensky would appear on the show to address the audience and the world. It was also unclear to sources whether he would appear live or use a pre-recorded message. However, most observers of the conflict suggest that Zelensky would opt for a live video address.  The news comes as the age-old discussion again revolves in Hollywood about whether art should remain out of politics amid events taking place in the world and particularly, in Ukraine. Show broadcaster ABC is thought to support having Zelensky speak. It is also expected that Mila Kunis, a Ukrainian-born actress who donated $35 million for Ukrainian migrants alongside her husband, Ashton Kutcher, are reportedly expected to make an address during the awards presentation. The contributions of Kutcher and Kunis have been acknowledged by Zelensky. The Ukrainian president posted a tweeted an image of himself in a Zoom meeting with the couple on on Sunday. The Academy has been tight-lipped about how it will weigh in on the crisis. Earlier this week, the show’s executive producer, Will Packer, reportedly told media that in such a ""time in humankind history"" it would be the right move to ""find a way to respectfully acknowledge where we are and how fortunate we are to even be able to put on this show."" Last week, when the Ukrainian president addressed the Israeli Knesset, he reportedly tried to speak to the hearts of people, finding similarities between Russia's special military operation in Ukraine and the actions of the Nazis in World War II. Zelensky stated that the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin was pursuing a ""final solution"" against Ukraine and asked for assistance from Israel, just as the Ukrainians ""came to the rescue"" of Jews 80 years ago. Some Israeli politicians, including the country's prime minister, did not appreciate the comparison of the special military operation in Ukraine to the Holocaust, which killed at least six million Jews. Others commented to Zelensky that Ukrainian nationalist collaborators actively cooperated with the Nazi regime and were directly involved in acts of the extermination of Jews. A week prior, in a virtual address to the US Congress, Zelensky referenced Martin Luther King Jr.'s iconic ""I have a dream"" speech, asking lawmakers to instate a no-fly zone over Ukraine. This move to reach out to the hearts of lawmakers by citing the iconic American caused some criticism in the country, as Washington is generally opposed to the move, with some exceptions. Others have suggested that instituting a no-fly zone over Ukraine would cause the start of World War III. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

BlackRock, which manages $10 trillion in assets, has been accused of making home ownership unaffordable for millions of citizens.  “For the first time, this generation is going to go into a store and not be able to get what they want,” Kapito told a meeting of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association. “And we have a very entitled generation that has never had to sacrifice.”“I would put on your seat belts because this is something that we haven’t seen,” Kapito added, warning that Americans will soon face “scarcity inflation” – or rising prices compounded by shortages of everything from food and consumer goods to oil and gas.The Biden administration has blamed spiraling inflation on Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine, with White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield referring on Tuesday to “Putin’s price hike,” and Biden himself said earlier this month that “there will be costs at home as we impose crippling sanctions” on Russia.However, inflation in the US had hit a 40-year high weeks before hostilities erupted in Ukraine, and Biden’s opponents have warned since last year that his policies – which involved spending more in his first eight months than former President Donald Trump did in 2018 and 2019 combined, and throttling domestic energy production – would trigger price spikes for ordinary Americans.BlackRock, however, has added trillions of dollars to its portfolio in recent years. The firm managed around $1.3 trillion in assets at the time of the last financial crisis, which soared to $8.68 trillion in January 2021, and passed the $10 trillion mark this January. BlackRock’s top executives have been rewarded by the Biden administration too, and have helped shape its economic policies. Brian Deese served as the global head of sustainable investing at BlackRock, and now directs the National Economic Council. Wally Adeyemo is a former senior adviser at BlackRock, and now serves as deputy secretary of the Treasury Department. Mike Pyle used to be an investment strategist at BlackRock, and now serves as Vice President Kamala Harris’ chief economic adviser.The firm has grabbed headlines in recent years for buying up properties throughout the US and turning them over to the rental market. Although the UN has criticized BlackRock’s former owner, Blackstone, for “wreaking havoc with tenants’ right to security and contributing to the global housing crisis,” BlackRock has been hired by the US government to buy up mortgages on its behalf, bringing even more properties under its management.Americans are expected to bear the brunt of the inflation Kapito warned about in the immediate term. According to estimates published by Bloomberg on Tuesday, the average US household will have to spend an extra $5,200 this year for the same basket of consumer goods. Wages are unlikely to rise to compensate for this expenditure, Bloomberg predicted, due to more Americans entering the labor force."

Trump also claimed that Biden is ""crawling around the globe on his knees"" to find alternative oil supply sources after the US banned all energy imports from Russia over its special military op in Ukraine.","Ex-POTUS Donald Trump has launched yet another attack on US President Joe Biden, accusing the latter of destroying ""the American dream"" within a year. Speaking at a ""Save America"" rally of his supporters in Commerce, Georgia, on Saturday, the 45th American president berated the Biden administration over the Ukraine crisis, high inflation, and soaring gasoline prices, slamming at some point of his speech NBC journo Chuck Todd as a ""sleepy son­-of-a-b**ch"".  Trump has repeatedly described Todd, moderator of NBC News's Meet the Press programme, as “sleepy”, also slamming NBC as “fake” news channel. Trump has had a longstanding feud with NBC News and Todd, whom he considered to be biased against his administration. The 45th president first used the word in April 2017, when he questioned why Todd and NBC News were not covering his claim that the Obama administration illegally spied on his campaign. ""When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and NBC News start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story?"" Trump tweeted at the time. It remains unclear why the former US president singled out the moniker during the Commerce rally. He then went further by asserting that the US president ""has been one train wreck after another"" and accusing Biden of ""disgracing"" the nation with ""his humiliating surrender in Afghanistan"" and skyrocketing inflation, which is the ""highest in over 40 years"". Trump also pointed the finger at Biden over soaring gas prices, the migration gridlock, and Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. Trump argued that ""[the] Ukraine [crisis] would've never happened"" had he been president of the US now. According to him, America currently has ""a president that has no idea what the hell he's doing and has no idea even where he is. The fake news, they're trying to say he's acting brilliantly […]"". The remarks followed the 45th president accusing Biden of failing to tackle Russia's special military operation in Ukraine due to Washington's concern over Moscow's nuclear potential. He told a rally of his supporters in Florida last week that POTUS is now afraid of attacking a ""nuclear power"", in an apparent reference to Russia, and yet again trotting out his claim that on his watch, the Ukraine crisis would have never taken place, alleging that Moscow's special operation came after Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly saw Washington's ""weakness"". ""It was my personality that kept us out of war. I was the only president in four decades who did not get America into any conflicts, except I totally defeated ISIS [Daesh*]"", the former US president claimed. Moscow's special operation, which has been underway since 24 February, was launched after the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for help in defending themselves against Kiev's forces.  Russia said that the goal of the operation is to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine and that only the nation's military infrastructure is being targeted. The Kremlin has repeatedly stressed that it has no plans to occupy Ukraine. According to President Putin, the operation's goal is to protect the people of Donbass, ""who have been subjected to abuse, genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years"".

He said that the ruble will be used for the sale of Russian natural gas to, what Moscow considers to be, “hostile” countries.“During the last few weeks, as you know, several Western countries adopted unlawful decisions to freeze Russian assets,” Putin outlined during a government meeting held via video link. “The West has de facto destroyed the credibility of its currencies.”The United States and the EU have practically defaulted on their obligations before Russia.

The response can be attributed to the negative attitude of the general population in the country towards the US and NATO, experts believe. ""Indeed, Indonesian public actively support the special military operation led by Russia in Ukraine,"" Vorobyova said. The ambassador noted that several factors account for this. Another critical aspect is the personal authority of the Russian president, according to the ambassador. ""The president’s actions aimed at building a fair multipolar world are frequently compared in Indonesia to the politics of the first president of Indonesia Sukarno, who had an anti-west stance and did a lot to establish close relations with the USSR,"" the ambassador added. Moreover, for Indonesians, Russia serves as an example of a country on a path to reaching inter-ethnic and inter-faith harmony, Vorobyova stressed. ""We often see local news outlets extensively cover the development of Islam in Russia. In this context, the participation of the Russian Muslim military including those from the Chechen Republic is met with great approval,"" the official noted. On 24 February, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian provocations. In response to Russia’s operation, Western countries have rolled out a comprehensive sanctions campaign against Moscow. "

The German and French brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.A number of countries around the world have since imposed severe sanctions against Russia. The US, EU, and their allies have cut off the country from their financial systems, limited dollar and euro transactions, and frozen roughly $300 billion in Russian forex reserves abroad, among other measures.In response, Russia is now demanding that “unfriendly” European nations pay for gas using rubles – a demand that the G7 countries and other buyers which are still heavily reliant on Russian energy have rejected. Nevertheless, Russia says it will not be giving away gas for free, and has given the countries until March 31 to begin switching to payment in rubles."

The videos are so extremely graphic that RT is unable to share them. The footage shows multiple people, apparently Russian prisoners of war, lying on the ground. All of the servicemen appear to be heavily beaten and have leg wounds.The injured soldiers are interrogated by armed men, many of whom are wearing blue armbands commonly used by Ukrainian units. Some of the wounded personnel apparently died during the interrogation. Footage also shows three other prisoners ordered out of a van and shotin their legs at a point-blank range.The extreme cruelty displayed in the videos has garnered condemnation, even from pro-Ukrainian figures. The founder of the US-government funded Bellingcat “investigative journalism” outlet Eliot Higgins, for instance, has described it as “very serious incident” and called for a “further investigation” of the disturbing imagery.Moscow attacked neighboring Ukraine last month, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

Most of the projects are in the fields of science, engineering, and technological development, the minister said.Wu also praised Russia’s science and space technology as being “very good” and said that bilateral cooperation has benefited Taiwan as it develops its own space capabilities, especially in small satellites.Taiwan is the unmatched leader of the global semiconductor industry, accounting for 92% of the world’s manufacturing capacity. The government has pledged to support international sanctions against Russia, with its chip producer giant TSMC having stopped the production of Russian microprocessors at its plant. Experts have warned, however, that a ban on tech sales to Russia could spark a global microchip war. Sanctions could backfire on manufacturers of computer processors and semiconductors, as many crucial components for their production are sourced exclusively in Russia, they said.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

He was joined at the Hiroshima peace memorial and museum by the US envoy to Japan Rahm Emanuel, a former White House chief of staff perhaps best known for his maxim “never let a good crisis go to waste.”Kishida himself spent some of his childhood in New York. Washington and its allies have made much of the fact that Vladimir Putin, last month, ordered Russia’s nuclear forces to be placed on “high alert.” However, Moscow’s stance on the use of such weapons has not changed, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.He reminded CNN, during an interview earlier this week, that his country's “concept of domestic security” is publicly viewable and lists any reason nuclear weapons might be used, such as “an existential threat for our country.”“There are no other reasons that were mentioned in that text,” Peskov pointed out.At the same time, US President Joe Biden has clung to the “right” to use nuclear weapons in a first-strike scenario despite having promised to change that same policy during his election campaign. Current US policy allows the use of nuclear weapons in response to “extreme circumstances,” a vague term that includes an invasion, chemical or biological attacks. Washington has repeatedly suggested Russia is planning to deploy chemical weapons in Ukraine, something Moscow denies.Japan is the only country to have been the victim of a nuclear assault, with the US bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki, during World War II. Kishida told the public broadcaster NHK that “When the possible use of nuclear weapons by Russia is increasingly real, I believe Ambassador Emanuel’s visit to Hiroshima and his experience of seeing the nuclear reality will become a strong message to the international society.”"

Russia is an important member, and no member has the right to expel other countries,” the spokesman said during a regular press conference.Wang said that at the moment, the global economy is at a critical stage, recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, while instability and uncertainty are rising. According to the spokesman, the G20 countries are responsible in particular for the world’s economic “stability and recovery.”Wang suggested that the G20 countries should work on multilateralism, solidarity, and cooperation to address the harsh economic and financial problems, as well as making “positive contributions to the realization of strong, green and healthy global development.”On Tuesday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the question of Russia’s membership in the G20 would be discussed with Western allies, adding that “it cannot be business as usual for Russia in international institutions.”The comment was made in the context of US President Joe Biden’s trip to Brussels for an emergency NATO summit on Thursday.Beijing has called for a de-escalation of the Ukraine crisis, but refused to condemn Moscow for its military campaign and, unlike many Western countries and some of their allies, has not imposed any sanctions on Russia. Beijing’s defiant stance prompted the White House to warn of “consequences” should it help Moscow bypass sanctions in any way."

Leaders in Berlin have been less enthusiastic about sanctioning Russian energy than some of their EU counterparts, with Scholz describing Russia’s energy as “essential” for the survival of Germany’s economy, and Economy Minister Robert Habeck urging citizens this week to reduce their consumption amid the growing likelihood of rationing.Nevertheless, Germany has sent shipments of arms to Ukraine and backed EU sanctions on Russia. It has therefore been labeled an “unfriendly” country by Moscow, meaning it will be affected by the Kremlin’s policy that it pay for gas in rubles. This policy is set to come into effect on April 1, with Russia warning that those who refuse to comply will see their gas supply cut off.Scholz rejected Putin’s gas-for-rubles demand last week, but Wednesday’s call suggests a softening of his position. According to readouts from both sides, Scholz demanded written information explaining how the switchover would work, while Russia said that “experts of the two countries would discuss this issue further.”According to Berlin, Putin told Scholz that payments could still be made in euros or dollars to Russia’s Gazprombank, which is not subject to EU sanctions. Gazprombank would then convert the payments into rubles.“Scholz did not agree to this procedure in the conversation, but asked for written information to better understand the procedure,” said a German spokesperson.Though the Group of Seven major Western economies have collectively agreed to reject Moscow’s demand for payment in rubles, Putin has fielded calls from individual leaders whose countries are still dependent on Russian energy. As well as speaking to Scholz, Putin talked to Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi on Wednesday and French President Emmanuel Macron the day before."

So, they moved all these threatening and dangerous activities to other countries,” Lavrov claimed.“More and more they concentrate their research and experiments around the borders of the Russian Federation and China,” he remarked.Lavrov was referring to biolabs funded by the Pentagon’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the existence of which was highlighted during Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The Russian military claims it has discovered evidence that the work in Ukrainian labs funded by the US Department of Defense had military applications.Washington has denied the claims, which had reiterated Russia’s previous suspicions about research undertaken on foreign territory in return for American grants. The US government said the labs existed to study emerging infections throughout the world and served as an epidemic early warning system.US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland last week testified under oath that there were “biological research facilities in Ukraine,” and that the US was assisting Kiev in destroying research materials so they would not get into Russia’s hands.In his interview with RT, Lavrov said that, in his assessment, there were more than 300 biolabs worldwide involved in research for the Pentagon. Such facilities should be subject to international monitoring for compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, which bans any work related to germ warfare. There is no verification mechanism for the treaty – a lapse Moscow wants addressed, Lavrov said.The UN Security Council is to convene later on Friday at Russia’s request to discuss a legally binding protocol to the convention, “which would require obligatory transparency measures by any participating state,” the minister said. The US stonewalled attempts to implement such a protocol throughout the 1990s before blocking it in 2001, therefore “the Americans … will be against it,” Lavrov predicted, branding the obstruction “not defensible.”Beijing has previously supported calls for greater transparency about American bioresearch, arguing that Washington would have nothing to hide if all work carried out in foreign labs was as benign as it claimed."
b4aa3103-91f3-49b3-b0c0-f0794ae8cafc,https://www.rt.com/news/552426-federal-reserve-interest-rates/,No ‘soft landing’ likely for US economy – Fed chairman,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.03/xxs/6238d6712030275f2b42b1fd.jpg,"Federal reserve will aggressively raise interest rates, but balancing this against inflation could prove “challenging”","Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Monday that the central bank will raise interest rates “more aggressively” in order to get spiraling prices under control. However, he acknowledged that doing this without crashing the economy would prove “challenging,” and cautioned that a “soft landing” is not guaranteed.Powell made his comments in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics, which was reported by multiple US news outlets. “We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability,” he said. “In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so.”A single basis point is equal to 0.01 percent. Last week the Federal Reserve increased its rates by 25 points, or 0.25%, raising the cost of borrowing from where it had sat near zero for the last three years to 0.5%. Fed officials predicted another six such increases over the remainder of 2022 and at least three in 2023.The Federal Reserve controls the short-term borrowing rate for commercial banks, which then pass this rate on to their customers. Higher rates make borrowing money less viable, which contracts the economy and lowers inflation. This method of reining in inflation was practiced most dramatically in the 1970s, when the Fed hiked interest rates to over 20% and stopped all bond purchases.Under both the Trump and Biden administrations, interest rates have been kept at rock bottom, while both presidents flooded the economy with money: Trump by overseeing the creation of a quarter of all the dollars ever created in 2020 and Biden by spending more in the first eight months of his presidency than Trump did in 2018 and 2019 combined, according to Fox News.Powell cautioned that readjusting the American economy downwards will not be a simple task. “No one expects that bringing about a soft landing will be straightforward in the current context,” he said on Monday, adding: “Very little is straightforward in the current context.”Monetary policy – the discipline of economic management that interest manipulation falls under – is a “blunt instrument, not capable of surgical precision,” he continued, adding that “My colleagues and I will do our very best to succeed in this challenging task.”Core inflation – a metric often cited by the Fed which excludes food and energy costs – rose 5.2% in January, the sharpest increase in 38 years when compared with the preceding January. Separate metrics by the US Department of Commerce showed the cost of goods and services up 7% in the fourth quarter of 2021, with food prices up 9% and energy costs up 34%. Far sharper increases in the cost of certain items, such as meat, have been reported by American shoppers, too.Once described by the Biden administration as “transitory,” inflation has been compounded by coronavirus-related supply chain disruptions, and shocks to global energy, grain, and fertilizer markets following the outbreak of war in Ukraine. "

The new policy came into force immediately after the president’s approval.Russia and Ukraine have consistently blamed each other for spreading disinformation amid the ongoing war.The implementation of the “unified information policy” came on the same day that Zelensky, also citing martial law, announced a move to outlaw 11 political parties, including the parliament’s second-largest group, Opposition Platform – For Life, for their “connections” with Russia.Earlier this month, Russian lawmakers approved legislation banning the dissemination of ‘fake news’ about Moscow’s military operation. Those found guilty under the law could be placed behind bars for up to 15 years. Russia’s media regulator Roskomnadzor also blocked access to several liberal news outlets, including Ekho Moskvy radio, Dozhd TV channel, and the Latvian-based Russian-language website Meduza.Responding to Ukraine’s banning of political parties on Sunday, Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin accused Kiev of trying to “shut the mouths” of people who disagree with it. Meanwhile, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev remarked sarcastically that Zelensky had “taken another step towards the Western ideals of democracy.”Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

However, it was noted that sea storms in the area caused the cables connecting the mines to bottom anchors to break, thereby resulting in the bombs drifting freely in the sea. The fact that the cables broke points to the ""unsatisfactory technical condition of the mines"". Russia's military operation in Ukraine began on 24 February, with the Kremlin citing the goal to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" the neighbouring country. According to Russia's Defence Ministry, Russian forces only target Ukraine's military infrastructure and pose no threat to civilians. Russia launched its military operation to support the breakaway People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. Western countries have strongly condemned the operation, calling it an invasion and imposing harsh sanctions on Moscow. "

The International Ski Federation (FIS) announced on March 1 that “no Russian or Belarusian athlete shall participate in any FIS competition at any level through the end of the 2021-2022 season,” acting on recommendations from the International Olympic Committee (IOC).Vyalbe, who is head of the Russian Cross-Country Skiing Federation, has said those guilty of “Russophobia” in the current climate would come to regret it.“The question of the attitude of foreign athletes to Russian ones is quite individual. All athletes, by and large, are dependent people,” the 53-year-old was quoted as saying on TV channel Rossiya 24.   “If their leaders tell them that they need to speak so that the Russians will not appear any further at the World Cup, then sooner or later they will do it. “I understand that politics and sports have been together for a long time, but everyone should still do their own thing,” added the three-time Olympic champion.“If an athlete trains and competes, a politician deals exclusively with politics... then there will be order everywhere in the world.“This general Russophobia, which, unfortunately... We just need to get through this time. I am sure that we will see how these people will apologize. “They will say: ‘Yes, guys, we didn’t know much, they didn’t tell us much, we now learned and, of course, we are ashamed of our actions.”Skiing star Alexander Bolshunov – a three-time gold medalist at the Beijing Games – spoke this week on how he felt threatened ahead of a planned event in Norway before Russian athletes were barred.   One Norwegian sports official, Oyvind Watterdal, resigned in protest at the decision to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes, saying: “It is a decision that is in sharp conflict with my values ​​and perception of what sports should be.”Russian officials have consistently decried the bans as “politicized,” claiming they undermine the notion that sport should be separate from politics.IOC chief Thomas Bach has dismissed that line of thinking, stating it is a “cheap argument” to claim that the current sanctions are unjustified. “Whoever so blatantly violates the Olympic Truce with political and even military means cannot denounce the consequences as being politically motivated,” Bach has asserted."

Without them, there is less tension,” said Cizeron in comments to RTL.Rodina, who won successive golds at three editions of the Olympic Games from 1972 to 1980, said those comments betrayed the notion that it would inevitably be easier for Russia’s rivals in the current climate.“It is easier to perform without Russians or other athletes. This is a fact,” said the 10-time world champion, who now serves as a State Duma Deputy.The World Championships in Montpellier saw the absence of Russian women’s stars such as Olympic gold medalist Anna Shcherbakova, world record holder Kamila Valieva, and ‘quad queen’ Alexandra Trusova.Cizeron and partner Gabriella Papadakis and partner broke the world record to clinch the ice dance title, adding to the Olympic gold they won in Beijing last month ahead of Russian duo Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov, who were also missing in France. Former Olympic ice dance champion Tatiana Navka said rivals were already fearful of the prospect of Russian skaters returning once the current ban has been lifted.   “Of course, competing at a tournament without the strongest is much calmer, there is no tension. Without our skaters, the World Championships lost a lot in class and entertainment,” said Navka.  “I am 100% sure that if our guys went to the World Cup in France, they would occupy the whole podium there. “I think everyone understands this. They understand, realize and are already afraid of the return of Russian skaters to the international arena,” Navka told Sport-Express.After being forced to miss the World Championships in France, Russian stars appeared at an alternative domestic event, the Channel One Cup, which was held in Saransk at the same time.The exhibition competition featured Olympic queen Shcherbakova and fan favorite Elizaveta Tuktamysheva, and marked a comeback for Valieva after her Olympic dream turned sour in Beijing.EDITOR'S NOTE: This story has been corrected to note that the original comments were made by Guillaume Cizeron, and not his partner Gabriella Papadakis.  "

According to the tabloid, the soldier had been “bored” with the ceremonial role of his regiment and wanted to see some real action as his promised tour to Afghanistan hadn’t happened, apparently due to the hasty withdrawal of the Western coalition forces from that country last year.The soldier opted to return to Britain after his superiors and fellow British fighters managed to persuade him that the longer he stays AWOL the worse the potential repercussions would get for him, the newspaper reported. Three other active-duty soldiers of the Guard are reported to have gone alongside him to Ukraine are still believed to remain in the country.“The Guardsman seems to have seen the error of his ways while he was in Ukraine and everyone is hugely relieved about that,” the source told The Sun.“He was in touch with his chain of command, who told him that he had to return. He knew he would be in trouble but was also told in no uncertain terms that it would be worse the longer he stayed out there,” the source added.The Guardsman is believed to have been detained by military police for questioning immediately after he touched down on British soil. He now could face a jail term for desertion. Earlier this month, the UK’s Ministry of Defence explicitly warned active-duty soldiers against going to fight in Ukraine on their own.“All Service Personnel are prohibited from travelling to Ukraine until further notice. This applies whether the Service Person is on leave or not. Personnel travelling to Ukraine will face disciplinary and administrative consequences,” a MoD spokesman said at the time.Moscow has repeatedly warned foreign nationals against going to Ukraine to try and help fend off the so-called Russian “military operation” launched there in late February.Over the weekend, the Russian military reinforced its point with a missile strike on the Yavoriv polygon in Ukraine’s west, where foreign fighters have amassed, claiming that “up to 180 foreign mercenaries” were killed in the attack. Moscow said on Sunday that it had conducted another such strike against foreign fighters, targeting a special-forces training center near Zhytomyr. Some 100 servicemen, Ukrainians and “foreign mercenaries” alike were killed in the fresh strike, according to Russian military.Moscow attacked its neighbor last month, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

No one will openly support Russia in the current situation…“Now there will be a chain of suspensions for international federations that look more at the political component than at sports or human factors,” added the former RBU chief.The current head of the RBU, Viktor Maygurov, suggested the organization would appeal any suspension of its membership with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland, having already launched an appeal against the ban placed on Russian athletes.Elsewhere, Russia is awaiting the outcome of a FIFA Congress in Qatar on Thursday, which could see the Russian Football Union (RFU) suspended from the global organization."

Referring to Moscow's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, the French president also said that he sees his task as ""achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of [Russian] troops [from Ukraine] by diplomatic means"". He spoke after Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters last week that Biden's statements are already becoming personal insults aimed at Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last Wednesday, when asked whether he would call Putin a ""war criminal"" Biden first responded in the negative, but after a pause changed his mind. In another development last week, POTUS did not think twice before calling the Russian president a ""murderous dictator"" and ""a pure thug"". Peskov described the remarks as unacceptable and unforgivable for the president of a country that had killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world with its bombs. According to him, the Kremlin puts Biden's words about Putin down to the irritability and forgetfulness of the US president due to exhaustion. ""Given such irritability of Mr Biden, his fatigue, sometimes forgetfulness, which leads to aggressive statements, we will not give sharp assessments so as not to cause more aggression"", Peskov said when asked whether the Kremlin regarded it as a prerequisite for breaking off diplomatic relations with the United States. The Russian president ordered the start of a special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February following a request from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) to protect them from intensifying attacks by Ukrainian forces. Putin stated that Russia was left with no other choice but to intervene to help the newly-recognised Donbass republics. He described the goals of the operation as the demilitarisation and de-Nazification of Ukraine, with Russia's Defence Ministry pledging that the Russian armed forces will only be targeting Ukraine's military infrastructure with high-precision weapons strikes.

Much of the world is looking to bolster oil reserves amid what the International Energy Agency warned on Wednesday could be ""the biggest supply crisis in decades"", as evidence mounts that US and EU efforts to keep Russian gas out of Western vehicles and residences may ultimately backfire. Sasse, who demanded on Fox that the US ""rearm"" the Ukrainian regime ""constantly"", and insisted that ""defeating Vladimir Putin"" is the only way to stop China from being able to ""displace the dollar"", is just one high-ranking American politician expressing alarm over the continuing de-dollarisation process encouraged by the wide-ranging sanctions on Russia. But outside the confines of Europe and the US, calls for global financial and oil distribution systems to move beyond the US dollar have grown louder since Washington effectively banned Iranians and Venezuelans from international trade over the last 4 years. The US dollar has served as the global benchmark for international oil sales since the 1970s, when the United States struck a deal with Saudi Arabia to standardise oil prices in dollar terms, an arrangement which led to the creation of the so-called ""petrodollar"". Per Quartz, 80% of global oil transactions are currently denominated in US dollars. Now, it seems the American push to eliminate Russian supplies from global oil markets may have finally been a bridge too far for a number of influential nations in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Regional powerhouses like India, South Africa, and Mexico have all issued public statements declining to take the West's side regarding Moscow' special military operation in Ukraine, indicating a growing willingness among rising Global South nations to finally take the plunge and look past the US monopoly on global trade relations. On Thursday, South African President Cryil Ramaphosa openly declared his support for the Russian Federation's denazification and demilitarisation efforts, noting that the current situation ""could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region"". But that could just be the tip of the iceberg. Arguably more distressing for Western governments are the potential economic ramifications of pushing traditional non-NATO allies away. ""Russian oil exports to India have quadrupled this month"", the Financial Times wrote Friday. The fact that the world's third-greatest oil producer and third-greatest oil consumer are pursuing their own trade relations, outside of the realm of potential Western interference, is ""a sign of the vast reshaping of global energy flows"" they say has taken place since the beginning of the Russian special operation in Ukraine. And it's now looking increasingly likely that Russia and India will go beyond a mere expansion in volume of oil sales, and move towards dropping the dollar together. For much of the so-called ""Third World"", official statements indicate the value of pursuing their own strategic interests now outweighs the risks of potentially jeopardising relations with the West. In such countries, where the ongoing de-dollarisation process inspires more relief than hysteria, long-standing anti-colonial grievances are reemerging. Still, there's little evidence that Washington's war hawks have gotten the memo. Sasse told Fox that ""we need to demonstrate"" that ""freedom-loving peoples around the world would rather have US leadership than Chinese oppression"".  So far, at least, it's unclear how his professed desire to ""cut the Russians off from the global economy"" might benefit the rest of the globe. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

In 78 days, NATO jets conducted 2,300 sorties, dropping 420,000 missiles and bombs, including cluster munitions and depleted uranium rounds. Up to 5,700 people were killed, with tens of thousands more diagnosed with cancers in the years that followed.","Before entering the Oval Office as Barack Obama’s vice president and then as president himself, Joe Biden served as a United States senator for over 30 years. Ahead of, during and after the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Biden was consistently one of the top hawks in Washington pushing for the conflict to be expanded into a full-on ground invasion. “Look, you have probably the only three people in Washington here who think we should go straight to Belgrade and arrest [Yugoslav president Slobodan] Milosevich,” Biden said in a May 1999 appearance on Meet the Press alongside the now late Republican senator John McCain. “But let’s not kid each other. We’re the only three people. The rest of this is malarkey. The Republican Congress won’t even vote for the bombing. The NATO forces won’t even go along with the idea of ground troops. And whether or not the president will or will not is not relevant. The question to me is: What is the definition of victory?” Biden complained.  In a second video, dated 1998, before the NATO air campaign began, Biden sparred with Republican lawmaker Joe DioGuardi about the Kosovo crisis, boasting that he had called for Belgrade to be bombed and for US pilots to destroy all bridges on the Drina River during the NATO intervention in Bosnia in 1995, which killed over 150 Bosnian Serbs, destroyed critical civilian infrastructure, and irradiated the region with DU munitions. In a third video, from an April 2002 gala dinner of the Albanian American Civic League in New York City, an apparently inebriated Biden vowed to continue to support having US troops “on the ground with loaded rifles and drawn bayonets” in the Balkans until US objectives were accomplished. “Why some of you ask have I been so relentless on Serbia and [post-Milosevich President Vojislav] Kostunica who I do not trust? Why have I been so reluctant, so persistent in not providing aid to the people of Serbia who are many good people – why? Because until they look in their hearts they can never cure themselves of the disease that they are the oppressed. And as long as they operate on that standard, this cycle will continue and continue and continue. So that’s why, not for vengeance, but for release - that it’s necessary for them to look the devil in the eye,” Biden said. Grim Anniversary NATO began a campaign of air and cruise missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 23 March 1999. The operation, cynically dubbed ‘Operation Noble Anvil’, continued until 10 June 1999, with a total of about 22,000 metric tonnes of bombs dropped on the country. The use of cluster bombs (37,000 of them) and depleted uranium constituted a violation of the laws of war, and Serbian doctors have reported a dramatic spike in oncological diseases, including juvenile cancers, in the wake of the conflict. In 2017, Serbian scientist Ljubisa Rakic calculated that the amount of DU dropped on Yugoslavia was equivalent to about 170 Hiroshima bombs. The bombing is estimated to have caused up to $100 billion in economic losses, destroying or damaging some 25,000 residential buildings, 470 km of roads, 595 km of railway infrastructure, 14 airports, 19 hospitals, 20 health centers, 69 schools, 18 kindergartens, 176 cultural monuments and 38 bridges. This included a raid on Radio Television of Serbia, which claimed 16 lives, and the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, during which three Chinese nationals were killed. All told, Serbian officials estimate that over a third of NATO’s targets were civilian. NATO’s formal justification for the attacks was a desire to “protect” Kosovar Albanians from ethnic cleansing and a “humanitarian catastrophe.” Before the conflict began, Albanian separatists allied to radical Islamist forces clashed with Serbian army and police forces in Kosovo and attempted to drive ethnic Serbs out of the region. After the bombing campaign was completed and NATO troops entered the breakaway region, separatists continued their campaign of violence against Serbs, with NATO breaking its promise to disarm the Kosovar militants – who have subsequently been accused of a series of grim war crimes ranging from killings of civilians to organ harvesting. In 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia, forcing over 200,000 ethnic Serbs to leave their homes. Washington established Camp Bondsteel – the second-largest American military base in Europe, and has kept “boots on the ground” in the region ever since. "

When it comes to Moscow and Kiev, this balance is yet to be determined.As of now, the hostilities continue and no political settlement has been worked out, so it’s hard to say whether the parties can achieve their political objectives, for which a huge price has already been paid in human lives and economic damage of colossal proportions. The prospects for other global and regional players – the EU, the US, China, Japan and Iran, among others – are much clearer.The European Union is sustaining damage and losses due to numerous severed trade and economic ties with Russia. The key challenge is to find alternatives to Russian oil, gas, metals, and other commodities on the European market. This will require a great concentration of resources and political will. It will affect the growth of the EU economy and determine how competitive its industry will be in the coming years.Nevertheless, however painful it may be, Russian raw materials can be replaced. For oil, it won’t take long, while Russian gas is a bit harder to cut. The situation will be different from nation to nation within the bloc, as their levels of dependency on Russian resources vary. Still, a range of Russian goods can likely be replaced within a few years.Regardless of the developments on the Ukrainian front and Russia’s foreign policy, pushing Moscow out of the common market will be a long-term process.The EU has to take care of Ukrainian refugees. This is not an easy task. The situation is changing rapidly, making an accurate assessment impossible, but we are clearly talking about millions of people. The EU nations need to accept these refugees and help them to adapt and even integrate. Many European countries will have to spend more on social programs. At the same time, this will benefit the EU in the medium term. It has extensive experience dealing with migrants. Germany especially excels at this. Unlike migrants from Islamic countries, Ukrainians aren’t that different from EU Europeans in terms of culture. They are better educated, adapt and integrate faster, and don’t tend to form closed communities. For the economy, this will be a great demographic injection.Most EU countries will vigorously increase defense spending. This will not necessarily correspond to growth in the bloc's political clout, however. It will still remain a junior partner within NATO. However, the political and military role of certain member states will become much more significant. Germany comes to mind again, since it has great capacity to increase its defense spending, modernize its army, and develop its defense industry. For the advanced military-industrial complexes of European countries, this will yield long-term benefits.It will also be a win for the European project as a whole. Russia has become a major consolidating factor for the EU, improving its internal discipline, strengthening its self-identity, and solidifying its Eastern flank.   On the surface, America’s expenses are not as significant, although banning Russian oil may cause some difficulties domestically, in the form of soaring gas prices, for example. However, Washington’s main problems are found elsewhere. The sharp escalation in the confrontation with Russia is a distraction from the Asia-Pacific region. The US will have to build up its military presence in Europe, which leaves fewer capabilities for containing China.America is also concerned about the possibility of the Ukrainian crisis turning into a war between NATO and Russia. If taken to the extreme, this could lead to nuclear escalation. Washington will have to contain Moscow but act within certain boundaries in order to avoid escalation here and now. It would appear that the current priority is to manage the intensity of the conflict and make sure it doesn’t boil over.In other aspects, the US is definitely set to make gains.The new level of confrontation with Moscow is helping NATO strengthen internal discipline and encourage European members to contribute more to common security.Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush were not able to achieve this. Now it’s being done with no difficulty at all. As a matter of fact, NATO may expand even further. Membership for neutral Sweden and Finland is now up for discussion, and support for this idea is growing in both countries. If Helsinki joins NATO, the bloc’s power will be projected over Russia’s northwestern areas.In theory, the United States could also use the need to divert resources to Europe to its advantage. Washington and its allies are now free to arrange an unprecedented hit on Russia’s economic and technological potential. Russia will undoubtedly remain a major military challenge for America and the West. However, they will be able to undermine the economy that this military potential is based on, and then redirect their attention to Asia. The US energy sector has a lot to gain from the crisis. Before long, it will take over a sizable chunk of the European market. It will also now be easier for the Americans to squeeze Russia out of the world’s arms markets. While China and India will remain major consumers of Russian weaponry, Moscow will find it more difficult to compete in other markets due to strong pressure from the US.Over the years, the US has accumulated a host of domestic issues. The ‘Russia factor’ could help both Congress and American society to regain a sense of unity and cohesion, however short-lived. That said, the degree to which the ongoing crisis could affect the 2024 presidential election remains unclear.Meanwhile, China gains a lot of room for action. Unlike the EU and the US, the PRC stands to lose very little due to the current crisis. Washington’s military and political pressure on Beijing is waning. With an extensive package of anti-Russian sanctions now in place, China can lay claim to a significant share of the Russian market, which has now been vacated by the collective West. While there may be infrastructural and logistical hurdles to overcome, Russian energy resources will become more accessible to China at lower prices than before. Furthermore, China is set to become Russia’s key financial partner – a partnership that will be skewed heavily in China’s favor. Thus, Beijing is further strengthening its positions on its northern and northeastern borders.There seem to be no alternatives to Russia partnering up with China.China will soon enjoy new opportunities to exert influence in Central Asia. As it learns from Russia’s experience with sanctions, Beijing will tighten its own economic and financial security to withstand a similar confrontation with the West. That said, current developments are unlikely to result in a full-fledged Russian-Chinese military and political alliance. It appears that China will maintain its distance and try to remain as flexible as possible.For Japan, in the short term, losses will most likely outweigh benefits. The prospect of signing a long overdue peace treaty with Russia is becoming very dim. Even before this new phase of confrontation, it was clear that Russia and Japan had reached an impasse in negotiations. While there wasn’t even a hint of progress on that track, at least the theoretical possibility of it remained. After the events of 2014, Tokyo pursued a balanced and pragmatic foreign policy, imposing mostly symbolic sanctions on Russia, while remaining active in the Russian market and maintaining constructive relations with Russia’s leadership. After February 24, 2022, Japan abandoned this approach and chose to stand with the US and the EU.Tokyo will sustain some costs as a result of withdrawing from the Russian market and having to find substitutes for Russian commodities, but these will not be critical. The main consequence is that the escalation of relations with Russia, just as we saw with Germany, will provide a strong incentive for a definitive review of the post-WWII national security paradigm when it comes to the use of armed force. Japan will now have the confidence to begin reclaiming its status as a full-fledged political and military power in the region. As a result, the solution to the ‘Northern Territories’ issue will be viewed, more and more often, from a military perspective.India will be barely affected. New Delhi will maintain dialogue with Moscow and thwart anyone’s attempts to hinder military and technical cooperation between the two countries. Still, lobbyists for Western arms manufacturers might find themselves in a more favorable position. China’s growing strength resulting from the crisis is a problem for India, but it’s nothing new.The Ukrainian crisis might also benefit a number of countries that are currently suffering from punitive US sanctions. First and foremost, this concerns Venezuela and Iran. Washington might lift some penalties to compensate for losses arising from the ban on Russian oil imports. Politically speaking, this is easier to do in Venezuela’s case, since the issue there is ultimately about the governmental system – something the US could turn a blind eye to for a time. Venezuela’s heavy oil could replace Russian imports on the US market, while Nicolas Maduro’s regime would be able to breathe a little easier and secure some profits in foreign currency.It’s trickier with Iran because of the country’s military nuclear program and the new version of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The latter is a multilateral process that also involves Russia. Technically, the US could let Iran resume trading oil on the global market without a nuclear deal in place. For example, the Biden administration could bring back the waivers that Donald Trump scrapped, which had allowed a number of European and Asian countries to import crude oil from Iran. The problem for the US here is that Tehran would also get a reprieve and strengthen its negotiating position, which would lead to pressure from Republicans who are against deals with the country. In light of pushing back against Russia, however, these differences might end up on the backburner. In any case, Iran would get the chance to benefit from this. This would also prevent the sanctioned countries from forming a coalition that could theoretically include China, Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. China will trade with the other three, but not at the expense of its ties with the West.All in all, the new stage of the Ukrainian crisis will have repercussions on a global scale. For some countries, it will entail losses in the short and medium term – and significant losses at that – but for many others, it will open new opportunities for extending their influence in the long-term.This article was first published in Russian on kommersant.ru"

The woman was eventually approached by officers and driven away in a service car, with police saying it was the only arrest at the event.On March 16, the Latvian Anti-Nazi Committee usually holds counter-events as well. Law enforcement authorities believe the potential meeting of people who hold opposing views creates a risk of provocation and tension. This year, Riga City Council did not approve the application of the Latvian Anti-Nazi Committee to hold a demonstration. Taking into account the situation in the world, in order not to aggravate conflicts, the organization decided against appealing the decision of the city council, said Andrey Pagor, a representative of the committee. Instead of holding a full-scale demonstration, committee members laid flowers at the monument to the victims of the Nazis.The controversial march honoring Latvian members of Waffen SS units had been suspended for the last two years as public gatherings were banned in the Baltic state as part of anti-coronavirus measures.The Latvian authorities had urged the organizers to refrain from staging it this year too. The chairman of the parliament’s National Security Committee Maris Kucinskis argued that the march should be called off to avoid provocations amid the tensions caused by the conflict in Ukraine.Remembrance Day of the Latvian Legionnaires is the day when the soldiers of the Latvian legion, which was a part of Waffen SS, are commemorated. It has been held in the EU country annually since the 1990s, facing condemnation from Moscow, but being largely overlooked by Brussels.Latvian authorities argue that while the legion did, in fact, technically fight on Hitler’s side, most of its members understood their role as fighting to regain independence for Latvia. Being part of the German military forces was the only way of preventing the return of Soviet occupation, Latvia says."

Fuel prices are revised on a daily basis and they vary from state to state depending on local taxes such as Value Added Tax (VAT) and freight charges,"In India's fight against inflation, the Congress Party has announced a three-phased nationwide protest campaign against the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government over rising petrol and diesel prices. The campaign titled ""Mehngai-Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan"" (Inflation-Free India Campaign) will kickstart on 31 March and will last until 7 April. Protesters, party politicians, and volunteers are expected to take to the streets across India and beat drums and bells to draw the government's attention to the issue. ""On 31st March at 11 a.m., people will protest outside their (BJP politicians') homes and public places with garlanded cooking gas cylinders and beat of drum-bells, other instruments to draw the attention of the deaf BJP government against the insurmountable increase in prices of gas, petrol, and diesel"", Congress General Secretary and Chief Ppokesperson Randeep Surjewala said. With Saturday's increase, petrol in Delhi will now cost INR 98.61 ($1.29) per litre, while diesel rates have gone up to INR 89.87 ($1.18). In Mumbai, petrol and diesel prices are INR 113.35 ($1.49) and INR 97.55 ($1.28) per litre, respectively. In Kolkata, petrol and diesel cost INR 108.01 ($1.42) and INR 93.10 ($1.22), while prices in Chennai were INR 103.68 ($1.36) and INR 93.73 ($1.23) on Saturday. Randeep hit out at the PM Narendra Modi-led government and said, ""The people of India have been betrayed, duped, and deceived by the Modi government"", ""Every day, increases in the prices of petrol and diesel as the also cumbersome increase in prices of LPG, PNG and CNG, has proved the dictum for the Modi government, which is to fleece the people, fill the coffers"", Surjewala said. Between 2 and 4 April, protesters will hold marches and sit-in demonstrations outside BJP politicians' offices at every district level and will culminate with similar protests in state capitals.  Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi took a dig at the BJP government sworn-in in Uttar Pradesh and said, ""The king prepares for a palace, while subjects reel under inflation"". Meanwhile, federal Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and federal Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari linked the surge in prices to the Russian special operation in Ukraine to demilitarise and de-Nazify the country, which Moscow started on 24 February. The launch of operation followed appeals for help made by authorities of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics that had been under shelling by Ukrainian forces. Sitharaman on Friday said: ""Fuel prices are surging because of supply chain disruptions due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Oil marketing companies are procuring crude oil on a 15-day average rate, which is higher because of the Russia-Ukraine war. The impact of that is on all the countries"".

Reimbursement of expenses incurred is not a one-step process,” Sorokin told TASS.“We have no doubt that all obligations will be fulfilled, but it isn’t easy to calculate everything in detail. We have sent all the information to UEFA.“I don’t know [how long it will take], but I think in April all this will be completed,” he added.The Champions League final had been due to take place at the 68,000-seater Gazprom Arena on May 28. The venue is home to Russian champions Zenit St. Petersburg, and hosted matches at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, 2018 FIFA World Cup, and 2020 UEFA European Championship.The 2022 Champions League final was set to be the second held in Russia, after Moscow hosted the 2008 edition between Manchester United and Chelsea.The removal of the final is one of numerous sporting showpieces that the country has lost since the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended sanctions against Russia in the wake of the military offensive in Ukraine.Among other events, Russia has lost the 2022 World Men’s Volleyball Championship and the 2023 Junior World Ice Hockey Championship. The 2023 Men’s World Ice Hockey Championship is also under question.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko has estimated that Russia will save more than 8 billion rubles ($79.5 million) by not hosting international showpieces, funds which he says will be redirected into the development of domestic sport.Russia surprised many this week by formally submitting a declaration of interest in hosting either the 2028 or 2032 editions of the UEFA European Championship.The move comes despite all Russian teams currently being suspended from UEFA and FIFA competitions – a decision which the Russian Football Union (RFU) has unsuccessfully appealed with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). "

According to him, the Ukrainian authorities ordered the nationalist battalions to use all available means to leave the city in disguise and dressed in civilian clothes, including via humanitarian corridors. He went on to reveal that more than 60,000 Mariupol residents have been rescued and, after getting to Russia, these people ""openly talk about all the mass atrocities and crimes perpetrated by the nationalists"". Earlier, on Sunday, the top military official said that Russia was urging Kiev to cancel its orders to the nationalists fighting in Mariupol to sacrifice themselves and become ""martyrs"". According to Mizintsev, the nationalists were given the green light to use more than 200,000 of the city’s residents as ""human shields"". Mizintsev noted that the Russian troops are aware of the ""human shield"" tactics and are acting carefully, avoiding the use of heavy artillery and clearing the city block by block. The Kremlin called on international organisations to put pressure on Kiev to demand that the nationalists do not hide behind people as human shields and release them through organised humanitarian corridors. Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine with the goal to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" the neighbouring country. Moscow underlined that its troops are targeting military infrastructure only and do not pose a threat to civilians. According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the goal is to protect the people of Donbass, ""who have been subjected to abuse, genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years"". "

Countries across Europe are making similar moves to cut Russia’s presence in their capitals.The latest news comes two days after Russia removed three Slovakian diplomats from Moscow, a tit-for-tat response to Bratislava expelling three of their Russian counterparts earlier this month. Moscow called the move “unjustified,” while the Slovaks claimed the envoys were involved in espionage.Since Russia launched its military offensive in Ukraine last month, European governments have responded by whittling down Russia’s diplomatic presence in their countries. Belgium, Ireland, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands on Tuesday expelled a combined 40 Russian embassy staff members, citing similar accusations of spying.  Russia has responded in kind. In a statement on Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said it had expelled ten embassy staff from Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, a week after these Baltic countries declared several Russian diplomats persona non grata.Russia has fiercely protested the expulsions. Responding to Ireland’s decision on Tuesday, Russia’s embassy in Dublin slammed the move as “arbitrary” and “groundless,” adding that it would “only deteriorate further Russian-Irish relations, already damaged by the Irish participation in illegitimate EU sanctions against Russia.”"

In the fall of 2020, Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a relatively short, but bloody, war over the territory. It ended with Baku making gains and Russia brokering a peace agreement, which saw Moscow send peacekeepers to the area. Pashinyan cited Baku’s claims that Yerevan had not responded to its five-point peace settlement proposal, sent via the Minsk Group - established in 1992, by the OSCE –  on March 10. According to the Armenian prime minister, his government responded on March 14.Speaking on Thursday at a government meeting, Pashinyan said that Baku “first dumps theses on a diplomatic or public platform,” and “ascribes some promises to Armenia,” claiming later that Yerevan is not complying with the agreements.Pashinyan believes that “Baku is trying to legitimize a large-scale attack on Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.” There is considerable concern in Yerevan that the Azeris might take advantage of the current situation where Russia is embroiled in the Ukraine conflict. Nevertheless, the prime minister expressed hope that, despite rising tensions in bilateral relations, his upcoming meeting in Brussels with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and European Council President Charles Michel on April 6 will bear fruit.“I once again express Armenia’s readiness to sign a peace agreement with Azerbaijan. Armenia is ready for the immediate start of peace negotiations,” Pashinyan said.On Thursday, Azerbaijan’s leader also expressed support for a peace agreement as soon as possible.The last few weeks have seen a significant escalation in tensions around Nagorno-Karabakh – a region populated with ethnic Armenians, but internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan – with the international community expressing concern over the developments.Armenia has accused Azerbaijan of seizing two villages, Khramort and Parukh – which the Azerbaijanis call Farukh – located on the armistice line which was established in 2020 between Azerbaijan and the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR). Armenian media claims that the ensuing firefight, which allegedly involved Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 combat drones, resulted in more than a dozen wounded and three killed on its side, as well as an unspecified number of Azerbaijani casualties.Baku denied the accusations, saying its troops were simply “continuing the process of clarifying their locations and positions without the use of force.”However, on March 26, Russian peacekeepers, who are currently patrolling the NKR, reported that the Azerbaijani military had violated the ceasefire, launching airstrikes against forces of the breakaway region. Baku then accused Russia of taking a “one-sided” view of the events. Blaming Armenia for the escalation, Azerbaijan claimed that it was responding to a “covert attack” by the “illegal Armenian forces.”"

The game is due to be played on the weekend of April 16.It’s ridiculous that we face the prospect of a half full Wembley for the Chelsea Vs Palace FA Cup semifinal. The FA must be allowed to sell tickets to Chelsea fans with all money going to the people of Ukraine.""The FA must be allowed to sell tickets to Chelsea fans so long as all money goes to the people of Ukraine,"" argued Julian Knight, the Tory Member of Parliament for Midlands town Solihull.""It is ridiculous that we face the prospect of a half-full Wembley for the Chelsea versus Palace FA Cup semifinal.""Chelsea is more than just its owner – it’s a living organism with huge importance to its fans and community.""Only season-ticket holding fans are able to attend Chelsea home games at Stamford Bridge under restrictions which also mean the club cannot sell merchandise, tie players to new contracts, make signings or spend more than $26,000 on travel to away games.The curbs have been implemented under a government licence Chelsea are operating under while potential buyers prepare bids for the third-placed team in the English top flight.When Abramovich stunned football by announcing that he wanted to sell the club on March 4 – six days before the sanctions were introduced – he said in a statement that he wanted the proceeds after legal fees to be used ""for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.""The billionaire has since been barred from making any sale, although the government is said to be keen to give special dispensation for a deal if suitable owners can be found.Chelsea's ticketing predicament came sharply into focus ahead of their FA Cup quarterfinal at Championship club Middlesbrough on Saturday.A controversial club statement on Tuesday asked for the game to be played behind closed doors in the interests of preserving the integrity of the competition.The second-tier side swiftly responded, calling the request ""bizarre and without any merit whatsoever"" before Chelsea withdrew the much-maligned proposal.Around 600 away fans who had bought tickets before they were taken off sale because of the restrictions placed on Abramovich are said to have traveled to Middlesbrough, with around 3,200 tickets returned by Chelsea and put on sale to home fans.I support the sanctioning of Ambramovich. However, we need mechanisms put in place to ensure fans can still watch Chelsea, the club can trade and ultimately be sold with cast iron assurances that not a rouble goes back to Russia in any form.Chelsea have won the FA Cup eight times and lost to Leicester in the final at Wembley last season.Knight has shared a message saying Putin ""must fail"" and said he supported the sanctions on Abramovich shortly after they were imposed.""However, we need mechanisms put in place to ensure fans can still watch Chelsea, the club can trade and ultimately be sold with cast-iron assurances that not a rouble goes back to Russia in any form,"" he added.Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech sealed Chelsea's place in the final four by scoring in a comfortable 2-0 win at Middlesbrough.Thomas Tuchel's team have won their last six games in all competitions ahead of their return to action at home to Brentford on April 2 following the international break.Premier League leaders Manchester City and second-placed Liverpool will meet in the other semifinal."

The Russian deputy prime minister and former energy minister, Alexander Novak, said that “some see it possibly reaching $500 a barrel.”Prices for Brent crude have more than doubled compared to this time last year. They climbed as high as $139 a barrel at the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the subsequent sanctions against Moscow. On Thursday, Brent was trading at $120 a barrel, while US WTI crude’s price stood at $114 per barrel.Meanwhile, the national average price for gasoline in the United States hit historic highs after Washington banned Russian oil imports. The price is currently up 71.5 cents per gallon from a month ago and $1.37 per gallon higher than a year ago, according to GasBuddy.The sharp rise has hit consumer confidence, raising concerns of a spending pullback which could lead the economy into a recession. President Joe Biden has claimed that Moscow is entirely to blame for surging US gasoline prices, conceding that he won’t be able to do much about runaway inflation at the pump.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

It’s because they wanted to be free, to do things differently, and for this country to be able to run itself,” he insisted.The ill-considered statement didn’t go unnoticed and shocked many, with the PM’s critics saying the comparison was inappropriate for several reasons.They pointed to the fact that the two events were extremely different in nature and scale. It was noted that – whereas Britain voted to quit the European Union in 2016 – Ukraine has just applied to join the bloc after Russia sent its troops into the country. Johnson was also criticized for implying that the EU wasn’t about freedom.“Boris, your words offend Ukrainians, the British and common sense,” former president of the European Council and an ex-prime minister of Poland Donald Tusk remarked. “I can still remember the enthusiasm of Putin and Trump after the referendum.”The European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator and former head of the Belgian government, Guy Verhofstadt, said the UK PM’s words were “insane.” He went on to clarify that “Brexit was about undoing freedoms and leaving the EU. Ukrainians want more freedom and to join the EU.”Johnson was labeled a “national embarrassment” by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey. “He is no Churchill: he is Basil Fawlty,” Davey said, referring to a misanthropic hotel owner portrayed by John Cleese in the popular 1970s British sitcom ‘Fawlty Towers’.Even the PM’s fellow Conservatives were angry, with former deputy prime minister Lord Michael Heseltine accusing Johnson of “cynical exploitation of the incredible bravery of the Ukrainian people.”Lord Gavin Barwell, who served as Theresa May’s chief of staff, also pointed out on Twitter that “apart from the bit where voting in a free and fair referendum isn’t in any way comparable with risking your life to defend your country against invasion and the awkward fact the Ukrainians are fighting for the freedom to join the EU, this comparison is bang on.”Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the breakaway Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."

The demonstrators were protesting against rising prices on fuel, energy and food, and called on the government to help the sector, to stop speculation, and adopt new laws to regulate supply chains.“The countryside has come to say ‘Enough of the government pimping us and putting the food and work of many people at risk,’” said Pedro Barato, head of the agricultural employers’ association ASAJA, adding that if the protesters’ demands were not met, it would demonstrate the “irresponsibility” of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.As many as 150,000 farmers, ranchers and hunters marched Sunday through Madrid to protest the Spanish centre-left government's failure to tackle soaring prices exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukrainehttps://t.co/Xh3WWyGiTrpic.twitter.com/UgE1z7ovjT“Today is the start of looking for solutions… Enough is enough, let the head of government stop traveling and start acting,” he told journalists during the march. Official sources estimated that 150,000 people attended the “20M Rural” mass protest in Madrid, which was organized and promoted by Alianza Rural, COAG, ASAJA and other agricultural worker’s unions. However, the organizers reported more than 400,000 people took part. The demonstration successfully concluded on Sunday afternoon without incident.The mass protests were backed by leaders of opposition parties Vox, Partido Popular and Ciudadanos. Santiago Abascal, the president of the far-right Vox party, reportedly demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.A spokesman for Citizens in the Congress of Deputies, Edmundo Bal, hinted that the PM’s actions were insulting to agriculture workers.“He treats us like idiots. And he wants us to believe that Putin is to blame for this situation,” he claimed, as quoted by the Spanish news outlet Vozpopuli. The unprecedented economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the international community in retaliation for the country’s attack on neighboring Ukraine in late February. The sanctions included such measures as asset freezes affecting an extended list of Russian officials and businessmen, as well as the closure of airspace over most European countries and curbs on exports and imports of certain goods, raw materials and energy sources. These sanctions have already had an impact on the global economy, as many countries are now experiencing rising prices on energy, gas and other commodities due to the disruption of supply chains."

Zakharyan is certainly one, and we hope he has a great future.""""However, in support of FIFA and UEFA’s ban of Russia from club and international competitions, we do not want to endorse or validate the teams Zakharyan plays for. We have therefore decided to leave 11th place vacant.""Reacting to the news, Zakharyan's club Dynamo Moscow called Goal's decision ""strange"" and ""frankly, the weirdest thing ever"".""We knew about the inclusion of Zakharyan in the list a month ago,"" Dynamo explained to Sports.ru.""A week ago, our club prepared an interview with a player on Goal issues,"" Dynamo added, while stating a representative assured them that, ""figuratively speaking"" football would be kept out of politics and that their prodigy would be on the list – claims which the club say they can prove.Dynamo then said that they were not notified of Zakharyan's expulsion, which is ""frankly,  the weirdest thing ever"" in their view.""We have no right to influence other people's awards, and for us it is not so important – well, they chose or did not choose. But the attitude itself is very surprising,"" the club said.""Note that before the strange decision, Zakharyan was the only player from Russia who was so high in this award. This year he was the only one from Russia,"" Dynamo went on.""At the request of Goal, we did an interview with him, and he was supposed to be delivered a prize: in fact, this is an entry into the top 11 team of the best young players in the world.""Once again we want to say: it was a complete initiative of this site – to establish an award and include anyone in it. We are glad that Zakharyan objectively deserved this result with his game, work, dedication – according to experts. It is not clear for what reason it should be excluded,"" the club concluded.This summer might indicate whether potential suitors have been put off by Zakharyan's nationality amid previous reported interest from the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona.In the upcoming transfer market window, his release clause will allegedly rise to €20 million ($22 million) and then €30 million ($33 million) the following year, but it is only valid for clubs playing in one of Europe's top five leagues in England, France, Spain, Germany or Italy.Before the championship was paused, Zakharyan had scored five goals and provided seven assists across 21 appearances in the 2021/2022 Russian Premier League season. "

The Russian Football Union has appealed that decision at the CAS [Court of Arbitration for Sport], they are awaiting the result of these deliberations,” said the FIFA chief.“I sincerely hope the conflict can end and we’ll be there the first day to play football again.“That’s what is needed in these countries. Russia as a football union, like any other federation, has not been suspended as such by FIFA, and has been participating in this congress as well.    “If we don’t have occasions to bring people together like a congress, then we’d rather stop and go home.”Infantino was asked if the suspension handed out to Russian teams would set a precedent, and that any nation perceived as an aggressor in future would automatically be slapped with a similar ban.“FIFA is acting everywhere in the world. We have to treat the same situations in the same way, and different situations in a different way,” Infantino replied.“We have to analyze every situation in the same way. You say we acted swiftly, I also heard we acted slowly. Any decision you take may be the wrong one, we will know with time.“We analyze every situation on its own merits, and based on our conscience, we try to take the decision we feel is the right one in these particular circumstances.”Infantino appeared to suggest there were double-standards in how the Ukrainian crisis had been treated compared to other conflicts around the world.  “Of course there are other situations of conflict, there are others suffering… It’s great that Europe welcomes Ukrainian refugees,” he said.“But a couple of months ago, we helped a couple of hundred Afghanis, mainly women and girls, with the help of Qatar, to come out of Afghanistan.“I was, we were, begging all countries to open up their doors, few opened their doors. Albania did, not the richest country in the world, but they did.“Many other countries didn’t. How can you treat a girl or a woman differently based on where they are from?” Infantino asked."

Lawyer Oleg Bydanov, who presented two weekly Russian language programmes on Melbourne's 3ZZZ station as an unpaid volunteer, was accused of airing ""offensive"" content. 3ZZZ manager Jon King claimed some listeners had complained that Bydanov was broadcasting ""offensive material, in conflict with our codes of practise."" The ""offensive"" content included an excerpt of Russian President Vladimir Putin's speech announcing Moscow's recognition of the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (the DPR and LPR). Bydanov also pointed out that the Russian forces in Ukraine were not targeting civilians, major cities or non-military infrastructure. In another programme, the presenter played a a satirical song that ridiculed the 2014 Maidan Square coup against elected president Viktor Yanukovych. And he informed listeners that he once worked for Alexander Bastrykin, chairman of the Investigative Committee of Russia and former prosecutor general. Bastrykin is one of numerous Russian officials and private citizens now subject to Western sanctions. Bydanov also opined that Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky was more intelligent than many Western politician, including Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. King said that because the station's presenters were all volunteers, ""we don't get to do as thorough a vetting process as a recruitment for a salaried position as, say, SBS would do with their broadcasters."" 3ZZZ president George Salloum said in a statement that the station condemned ""all acts of war and violence."" ""3ZZZ promotes harmony and diversity and contributes to an inclusive, cohesive and culturally-diverse Australian community, the first guiding principle under our community radio broadcasting codes of practice,"" Salloum said. Russian TV news channel RT has already been taken off air by Australian satellite operator Foxtel. "

The French government owns a 15% stake in Renault. In addition to halting production, the group also said it was exploring the ways to sell its stake in the biggest Russian automaker, AvtoVAZ.Renault owns almost 67% of AvtoVAZ, having bought out stakes held by Nissan in 2017 and General Motors in 2019. The company had initially suspended operations at its Moscow plant at the start of the conflict, but had resumed production since.Another French company named by Zelensky, home improvement chain Adeo, said it would not close its operations in Russia because that would be considered a premeditated bankruptcy and could open its assets up to expropriation, which would only strengthen the government in Moscow. The company said it had “suspended new investments” in Russia at the start of the conflict.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday thanked the foreign companies that continued working in the country “despite the brazen pressure from the US and its vassals. They are sure to find additional opportunities for growth in the future,” he added.Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.

However, there have been reports that mercenaries are fleeing to neighboring Poland in large numbers. Russia has said that it has struck at least two military training facilities in Ukraine where mercenaries were being hosted."

No China? No problem"".""The Russians subsequently were banned from the worlds, not because of the state-sponsored doping that produced the Kamila Valieva scandal in Beijing, but because of their nation’s invasion of Ukraine,"" Brennan added.A frequent Russia critic, she claimed that the Russians' absence resulted in the pairs title being ""there for the taking"" as the Americans ""rose to the occasion, scoring personal bests in both their short and long programs.""No Russia? No China? No problem. Americans Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier win USA’s first pairs skating world title since 1979. Meanwhile, the other US pair withdraws due to injury in the middle of their performance. My @usatodaysports column: https://t.co/Vk8JO6T4SwIn another column previewing the tournament, Brennan repeated her line as to why Russians wouldn't be present and sniped that ""few will miss them.""""Their absence means the women’s event will be wide open without the first, second and fourth-place finishers from Beijing, giving at least two women the opportunity to make the podium who did not have that chance last month,"" Brennan noted.""It also means the second and third-place finishers are out in the pairs event, as well as the silver medalists in ice dancing."" Brennan's remarks come after ex-Globe and Mail reporter Beverley Smith reacted to Kaori Sakamoto topping the women's short program in Montpellier with a score of 80.32 – which is far inferior to the world record 90.45 tally Valieva produced at the European Championships in January, and her previous world best of 87.42 before that at November's Rostelecom Cup.""There were no triple Axels to be seen, but what a sane women's event this was, compared to the crazy drama at the Olympics,"" Smith said, in a nod to Valieva's failed December 25 doping sample from the Russian Championships that didn't emerge until the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) had won already clinched the team event in Beijing.""Sigh of relief: no Russian skaters or judges. Love it. It wasn't the skating or sport world that really made this happen: it was the war in Ukraine,"" Smith finished.There were no triple Axels to be seen, but what a sane women's event this was, compared to the crazy drama at the Olympics. Sigh of relief: no Russian skaters or judges. Love it. It wasn't the skating or sport world that really made this happen: it was the war in Ukraine.Legendary Russian coaching icon Tatiana Tarasova has already responded directly to Smith through Sport-Express, saying: ""I want to upset Beverley: we will only be gone a year, and we will return with even greater strength.""Elsewhere, to RBC-Sport, Tarasova gave her thoughts on the decline in quality at the world championships that the North American journalists have also so brazenly praised.""Among those who skated, the Japanese skater was the best,"" Tarasova began. ""But we have the experience of the Olympic Games. If our girls took to the ice, she would have no chance of winning first place.""Tarasova accepted that Sakamoto ""did everything cleanly"" to lead with her short program, but scoffed that her routine was like a ""skate from 20 years ago.""""All the elements were done, but there were no elements of the highest complexity, and our girls strive and do the highest complexity, [to] develop in technical perfection,"" Tarasova went on, saying that though the ""Japanese [girl] skated well"", it was not at ""a high level, of course.""Had Russian skaters been allowed to compete, Tarasova noted, they would have been ""the first everywhere.""The World Figure Skating Championships are set to conclude on Sunday in Montpellier.Absent Russian stars including Valieva and Shcherbakova will instead take part in the domestic Channel One Cup in Saransk, which gets underway on Friday.  "

The nonbinding resolution calling for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine was endorsed by 141 UN members, with five voting against and 35 abstentions – including 17 African countries.Mpango said that the African continent is going through a “momentous time” and seeing “a transformation of trade routes from the established colonial ones to Africa doing more business with the eastern world.” This is an opportunity for the continent to make progress, by diversifying its culture and using technology to better interact with the world, he added.“We are witnessing the shifting of tectonic plates, particularly with the rise of China and India on the global economic stage,” Mpango said.The changing global circumstances are an opportunity for African nations to forge a new path for themselves, Mohamed Beavogui, the prime minister of Guinea, said.“We are at a crucial turning point as the world is in crisis,” said “For years people said don’t worry about war ‘it’s only in Africa’. Now it is in the middle of Europe and we are suddenly asked to choose,” he said in Dubai. “We want to see if it is possible to get people around a table to talk to each other.”Africa has troubles of its own that require government attention, Uganda’s prime minister, Robinah Nabbanja, said. “We have more problems and abstaining is the way of diplomacy,” she said.I joined a panel on ""The Rise of Africa: Dynamics and Strategies"" @WorldGovSummit in Dubai where I emphasized the opportunities of investment, a growing population,skilled labour force& need to access markets for our produce.

As Congolese troops and the rebels fought, a UN peacekeeping mission helicopter went down in the area, killing all eight officers on board.That is not to say that the conflict between Moscow and Kiev is not affecting the continent. Much of Africa imports grain from both Russia and Ukraine, but the trade has been disrupted due to military operations as well as Western sanctions. “We have already seen rapid increases in food prices, we’re also seeing fertilizer costs rise and steel prices are going up,” Mpango said.Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.

It is the culmination of a 12-year process by which Canada has sought to replace its outdated CF-18 jets.In its successful 2015 bid to oust Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper from power, the Liberal party of current PM Justin Trudeau campaigned against a controversial 2010 deal to acquire F-35s, vowing to instead pursue “open and transparent competition” as Canada updates its air force.“They clung to an aircraft that does not work and is far from working,” Trudeau reiterated in 2016, bashing the Conservatives for their plan to procure F-35s. His government nevertheless eventually chose Lockheed Martin as the preferred bidder, with Procurement Minister Filomena Tassi claiming on Monday “We’re in a different place today.”While Washington and US-based arms dealer Lockheed Martin have touted the F-35 as one of the most advanced fighter jets ever developed, the project has been a costly one for US taxpayers, who've footed the bill for a long series of delays, malfunctions and cost overruns. Nonetheless, a number of American allies have lined up to buy the plane.Earlier this month, Berlin announced the decision to replace its fleet of outdated Tornado fighters with up to 35 US-made F-35 stealth aircraft, with the local press saying it is an “open secret” that Germany needs modern aircraft to carry US nuclear bombs stored in the country in case of a conflict.In February, Finland also penned a multibillion-dollar deal to purchase 64 F-35 jets to replace its current Hornet fleet, rejecting alternative options from other planemakers including Dassault Rafale of France and Eurofighter Typhoon in the UK.Multiple European countries have pledged to significantly boost their defense spending amid the ongoing Russian military campaign in Ukraine. Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

Responding to two recent public scandals, Alexey Arestovich called on Ukrainians to respect the Geneva Convention and laws of war.“We must not go beyond the Geneva Convention, which allows the destruction of the enemy on the battlefield, but does not allow us to mock prisoners of war, and even more so to make calls for revenge on civilians, children, and prisoners of war,” Arestovich said in a video posted on Facebook.Such calls severely harm Ukraine’s public image, Arestovich added, reminding Ukrainians that they also run afoul of international and domestic laws. The presidential adviser specifically referenced two on-air outbursts by public figures that have done the rounds over the past week. On Sunday, doctor Gennadiy Druzhenko told the Ukraina 24 TV channel he had ordered his volunteer unit to castrate all male Russian prisoners of war, “because they are cockroaches and not people.”Druzhenko apologized on Monday, saying he had got carried away by emotion and that neither he nor his colleagues have ever maimed anyone or had any plan to do so.Earlier this month, Ukraina 24 presenter Fahruddin Sharafmal repeatedly cited a Nazi war criminal to urge his countrymen to “kill at least one Moskal” – a derogatory term for Russians – each and exterminate Russian children so the Russian nation itself would perish.Sharafmal later apologized that his calls for genocide had damaged the reputation of Ukraine, saying he had become emotional because a friend of his had died during the offensive. Ukrainians would “never be inhuman, unlike the Russians,” he said in his apology video.Arestovich, a psychologist and public relations expert, has been giving daily briefings on the conflict with Russia. On Monday, he claimed Ukraine had so far destroyed four out of 10 Russian forces – three on the ground and one in the air.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

However, both dynastic political families have skeletons in their closets, says Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel.","""Having run and lost twice, Hillary Clinton and her team are more likely to try orchestrating a 'Draft a Savior for the Democrat Party' movement and then, reluctantly accept this mantle once it becomes clear that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are not viable as standard-bearers and as opponents against the eventual Republican ticket in 2024,"" says Wall Street analyst and investigative journalist Charles Ortel. Joe Biden's odds of winning a potential re-election bid are waning: the president's approval rating plummeted to 40% this week, according to a Reuters-Ipsos poll. At the same time, the survey indicated that 54% of Americans disapprove of the president's work amid skyrocketing inflation and US-Russia tensions over Moscow's special operation to de-militarise and de-Nazify Ukraine. To complicate matters further, scandals surrounding his son, Hunter, are continuing to hunt Joe Biden. Thus, the New York Times suddenly acknowledged last week that a trove of bombshell documents discovered on Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop almost a year and a half ago were ""authentic."" The story was first broken by the New York Post in October 2020. Following the release of the NYT's article former Attorney General Bill Barr on 21 March told Fox News that Joe Biden ""lied to the American people"" during a presidential debate when he called The Post’s exposure of Hunter's emails ""a Russian plant."" On top of this, Jack Maxey, a political activist and former Steve Bannon podcast co-host, who provided several mainstream media with copies of a hard drive from Hunter's laptop, vowed earlier this week to make the content of the device public. After that Maxey was banned by Twitter. However, on 24 March, in an interview with American journalist Chase Geiser, Maxey said that he is in Switzerland releasing an indexed version of the laptop. However, Hunter Biden's scandals are not limited to the infamous laptop. On 20 March, Dmitry Rogozin, former deputy chairman of the government of the Russian Federation and incumbent director general of Russian space agency Roscosmos, suggested on Twitter that Joe Biden has resorted to the arming of Ukraine in order to ""burn down all possible evidence of his family's corruption"" in the Eastern European state. Following the 2014 coup in Ukraine, Hunter Biden had served on the board of directors of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma despite having no experience in the energy business. Rogozin also tweeted that Russian law enforcement authorities ""might be interested in thoroughly investigating"" the Biden family's alleged misdeeds in Ukraine to understand the American elite's motives and reasons behind the US-backed coup d'etat in Kiev in February 2014. Meanwhile, on 24 March, Chief of Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defence Troops Major General Igor Kirillov told journalists that Hunter Biden's Rosemont Seneca investment fund participated in the financing of the Pentagon's military biological programme in Ukraine. Kirillov noted, citing a trove of documents obtained by the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD), that Rosemont Seneca maintained ""close ties"" with the US defence contractors, including Metabiota and Black &amp; Veatch (B&amp;V), which reportedly supplied equipment for Pentagon bio-labs across the world. Following Kirillov's briefing, Sergei Tsekov, Russian senator and former head of the Supreme Council of Crimea, called for a parliamentary investigation into Hunter Biden's apparent participation in the Pentagon's military biological programme in Ukraine. Washington continues to deny that it has ever been involved in the development of bioweapons in Ukraine. However, Victoria Nuland, US under secretary of state for political affairs, admitted under oath that there are some ""biological research facilities"" in Ukraine apparently overseen by the US. While Team Clinton may indeed capitalise on scandals haunting the Biden family, Hillary and Bill have as many skeletons in their closet as the Bidens, Ortel notes. The Clintons' major problem is their charities which have never been properly organised and managed, according to the Wall Street analyst, who suspect that the Clinton Foundation is mired in a huge charity fraud. Ortel has been investigating the foundation for several years and believes that it was used as a ""vehicle"" for enrichment and pay-to-play schemes by the Clintons. The Clinton family has recently announced the revival of its Global Initiative, which is seen by some observers as yet another signal that Bill and Hillary are returning to big politics. Still, the Clinton Global Initiative appears not to be operating lawfully, according to Ortel. Ortel notes that after holding meetings that arguably served as business development and political advancement forums from 2005 through 2008 in New York and then in Hong Kong during the Obama-Bush transition, the parent and a new ""Clinton Global Initiative, Inc."" tried but failed to reorganise and to operate lawfully from September 2009 through 2013. ""So, whatever 'CGI' the Clintons believe they might launch again is radioactive, unless NY and federal authorities remain in the tank protecting the Clintons at all costs,"" the Wall Street analyst warns. There is yet another problem on the Clintons' horizon, namely Special Counsel John Durham ""spygate"" investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe. Two indictments released by the special counsel late last year indicate that the Hillary Clinton campaign played a significant role in peddling uncorroborated information about Trump's alleged ties with Russia's Alfa Bank and the Kremlin.  Both claims turned out to be bogus. What's more, at least one participant of the anti-Trump fishing expedition, named Tech Executive-1 in Durham's court filings, bragged that he was offered a position in the Hillary Clinton administration should she won. Even though Hillary Clinton continues to portray the Durham investigation as a right-wing conspiracy, the American public is unlikely to ""fall for yet another Clinton family ruse,"" concludes Charles Ortel.

Putin has demanded that, as of Friday, “unfriendly” countries – those who “illegally” sanctioned Russia’s central bank in response to the conflict in Ukraine – will have to pay for Russian gas in Moscow's currency or have their supply cut off.However, Habeck told reporters that existing gas contracts between European nations and Russia, which were negotiated in euro, “must be observed.” Habeck reiterated an earlier statement from the Group of Seven major economies, which read, “We will under no circumstances accept paying for gas deliveries in a currency other than the contractually agreed currency.”Putin spoke by phone with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanel Macron on Wednesday, and outlined a system whereby both countries would continue to pay in euros, which would then be converted to rubles by Russia’s Gazprombank – which has not been sanctioned by the EU – upon receipt. “Scholz did not agree to this procedure in the conversation, but asked for written information to better understand the procedure,” a German official said, while a French official said, “France is against paying in rubles.”It is unclear whether Habeck and Le Maire’s insistence that the original contracts in euros be honored extends to an outright rejection of the euros-to-rubles deal proposed by Putin on Wednesday. As Putin’s deal would involve interacting with Russia’s central bank, European leaders have been reluctant to agree. However, Habeck said that Germany is prepared for Russia to potentially cut off the flow of gas should a deal not be reached. The Kremlin has threatened to shut off the gas flow to countries who refuse to pay in rubles, and Russian newspaper Kommersant reported on Thursday that energy giant Gazprom is currently “considering the possibility of a complete halt in gas supplies … and is assessing the consequences of such a step.”Germany is heavily dependent on Russian energy, with Russia providing more than half of its gas supply, and a third of its imported oil. France counts on Russia to provide around a third of its gas and around 10% of its oil. Habeck already urged citizens this week to reduce their consumption amid the growing likelihood of rationing, and on Wednesday told German broadcaster ZDF that Germans “will be poorer” as a result of the sanctions placed on Russia. "

The incident occurred in the middle of service and was captured on video by stunned churchgoers. The footage quickly made its way across social media, with many reporting it as Ukrainian nationalists assaulting and kidnapping a pro-Russian priest. In the video, alleged members of Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Forces can be seen assaulting and forcefully dragging away the priest, as well as another man who was reportedly trying to aid him in the confrontation.The incident occurred at the Church of the Intercession, which is part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is still loyal to the Moscow Patriarchy. It comes amid an ongoing rift between Ukrainian churches. Since the early 1990s, some clerics have been breaking away from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) and joining the independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine under the Kiev Patriarchy (OCU), rejecting historic ties with Russia. In recent years, the rift has been characterized by forceful takeovers of some temples in Ukraine by Kiev-allied worshipers and activists, which the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) has decried as “wild.”Last week, Ukrainian lawmakers introduced a bill to parliament calling for the complete ban of the Moscow Patriarchy on the territory of Ukraine and the seizure of all its assets within the country.A representative of UOC-MP, Archpriest Vasyl Vozniuk, who is the secretary of the Cherkasy Diocese, issued a statement regarding the kidnapping, saying the provocation was carried out at the behest of a group of local priests, led by Father Nikolai Seredich, who has been inciting “schismatic actions” by demanding the temple break away from its Russian counterpart and join the OCU. “In recent weeks, several priests from Smila, without consulting or informing their colleagues – most of the clergy of the Smila denomination and their own parishioners, began to incite each other and readers from the internet to schismatic actions,” he said.Vozniuk claims that the church tasked Father Vasyl Miroshnychenko with quelling the discord in the Smilan church, however, the insurrectionists apparently accused him of harboring pro-Russian sentiments and invited a group of armed men to forcefully remove Father Vasyl. Some of these “people with weapons” are reportedly still “on duty” near the temple.The statement from the secretary goes on to claim that Father Vasyl is currently “alive and well” and “continues the service and confession of the clergy of the Smilansky denomination,” while Seredich, who has been accused of inciting armed people to use violence against the priest, has been banned from the priesthood pending an investigation into this incident.Nevertheless, the video of the incident has quickly gone viral, and many have been expressing outrage over the actions of the Ukrainian territorial defense forces members. The head of Russia’s Investigative Committee, Aleksandr Bastrykin, has issued an investigation into the matter, which has been declared a kidnapping, with the goal of “identifying the persons involved.”The incident comes as Moscow is currently carrying out a military operation in Ukraine. However, the village of Smila has not seen any combat during this period, although some parts of the Cherkasy region have experienced shelling from both Russian and Ukrainian forces.Russia’s operation was launched last month, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French- brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military alliance. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the Donbass by force."

Instead, Lavrov said, Russia would wait and “see how they will be finding a way out of this dead end they have driven themselves into.”On top of that, Russia’s top diplomat argued that “even regardless of the situation around Ukraine and sanctions, the West’s behavior just goes to show that it is an unreliable partner.” The recent freezing of Russia’s central bank’s assets, according to Lavrov, illustrates that other countries’ reserves could potentially be “simply stolen” too.Lavrov also claimed that Western companies that have pulled out of Russia have done so under immense pressure from their governments. He added that Moscow would solve all the economic problems it was facing.The Russian official went on to argue that “in NATO, it is of course the US that calls the tune.” According to Lavrov, “now the European Union is being trampled on by NATO,” with “countries that are not NATO members – neutral nations – Sweden, Finland, Austria – joining in the cooperation called collective mobility.” Lavrov noted that the latter term effectively stood for those countries’ consent to the military alliance moving its hardware and troops through their territory “when NATO needs to move its military infrastructure eastward.”Speaking of NATO and the EU, Lavrov claimed that “there is little democracy in the Western structures,” adding that consensus in both NATO and the EU was a “fiction.” He referenced the Western sanctions imposed on Russia following 2014 when, as Lavrov put it, “you would think everything had already happened: Crimea, the Donbass, the Minsk agreements.” Russia’s top diplomat noted that the West kept introducing new batches of punitive measures every six months regardless. Lavrov said that in private conversation, many European colleagues had told him that they realized that sanctions were a road to nowhere. Yet those European officials supposedly also told their Russian counterpart that there was such a thing as the European consensus. Lavrov claimed that no one in Europe apparently had the guts to make their true feelings regarding anti-Russian sanctions known.Following February 24, when Russia launched a military campaign against Ukraine, the US, Canada, the whole of the EU, Australia, Japan and several other nations slapped crippling sanctions on Moscow, targeting, among other things, the country’s central bank’s assets, a number of major commercial banks, as well as Russia’s top officials, including Putin and Lavrov."

She had taken to Twitter on Sunday to make it clear that Biden has “no plans to travel into Ukraine.”The spokesperson said that, for any president, traveling into a war zone requires not only security considerations, but “an enormous amount of resources on the ground which is always a factor.”“But also the president felt and the security team felt that he could have the most effective and impactful trip by convening these meetings with NATO leaders, the G7, the EU in Brussels to determine both the continued military coordination, humanitarian and economic coordination, as well as by going to visit Poland right next door to talk about everything from refugees, refugee assistance and continued assistance we can all provide together,” Psaki said.Biden is scheduled to take part in the NATO summit and other meetings in Brussels on March 24. The following day, he will go to Warsaw for a meeting with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda to discuss the response to the “humanitarian and human rights crisis” created by the conflict in Ukraine, according to the White House.Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson allegedly plans to make a “lightning” visit to Kiev, even though his own security services are advising him against the trip, amid the worsening security situation in the Ukrainian capital. This is according to the Daily Mail, which has cited a ""Whitehall source.""Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

Chelsea have lobbied for terms of the special licence to be amended and have received some dispensations from the UK government, but restrictions on travel budgets remain in place. The club are also not allowed to sell tickets or merchandise, a move which forced the closure of Chelsea's club store.Several of the bids are understood to be under serious consideration. The Ricketts Family's experience in guiding the Cubs to the 2016 World Series crown is thought to have demonstrated a measure of expertise in how a sports franchise can be successfully operated, while Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly is also thought to be at the top of the queue.British property investor Nick Candy has also pledged to ""give football back to the fans"" should his bid prove to be successful, and has also confirmed that he will oversee a much-needed redevelopment of the club's Stamford Bridge stadium. Candy has also stated he will give a ‘golden share’ stake to fans, meaning that supporter groups will have a say in Chelsea's future plans. ""Chelsea is one of the most iconic and successful professional football clubs in the world, with a rich heritage, global following, and a highly valuable brand,"" Candy said. ""Football clubs are vitally important community and cultural assets, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to give football back to the fans and put them at the heart of the operations and strategy of a leading global football club.""I believe Chelsea has all of the fundamentals to become the most valuable and respected sports club in the world and a force for the greater good in everything it does.""It is also understood that there were more than 20 parties interested in bidding, with around 10-15 official bids submitted.Chelsea and the Raine Group will whittle the contenders down to a shortlist next week, with the successful bidder then requiring approval from the government as well as being required to show the source of their funds.The successful bidder will also be required to pass the Premier League's owners' and directors' test.It is thought that Abramovich values Chelsea at around £3 billion. He has also loaned the club £1.5 billion - a sum which he says he is happy to write off. Chelsea, though, will be hoping that any proposed deal will progress without any further snags as the sanctions against Abramovich have left them mired in financial turmoil, and as they struggle to contend with a £28 million per month wage bill."

The measures cover 33 entities, including most of Russia’s banking sector and all institutions responsible for the country’s sovereign debt.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

The combat medic, whose volunteer team has been described as “medical angels” by the Western media, said “cockroaches” don’t deserve the right to procreate.The shocking confession came from Gennadiy Druzenko, a constitutional lawyer-turned-volunteer frontline medic in Ukraine. Speaking to Ukrainian media in a live interview, he condemned the US for its reluctance to go to war with Russia on Ukraine’s behalf, before commenting on the Russian military.“Trust me, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s military hardware burns well. The corpses of ‘putinoids’ may stink, but they become unthreatening,” he said.Druzenko said that, during the conflict, he had diverged from the principle that requires an injured enemy combatant to be treated as a regular patient.I gave my doctors … a very strict order to castrate all men, because they are cockroaches and not people.He further implied that, at the hands of his unit, Russian prisoners of war “will die in very large numbers” so that surviving Russians remembered Ukraine with terror “like the Germans remembered Stalingrad.”At this point, the host cut the interview short, stating that Russian soldiers would be “held accountable.” Her co-host reminded the audience that Russia was being investigated for alleged war crimes in Ukraine.On Monday, YouTube blocked the entire livestream segment, which included the interview, after it drew public attention.Russia has launched a criminal investigation into the threats.Druzenko heads the Pirogov First Volunteer Mobile Hospital, a unit of civilian medics that has been providing services to Ukrainian troops since 2014, when post-coup authorities in Kiev sent the Ukrainian military to quash a rebellion in eastern Ukraine. He is an acclaimed figure at home and has received numerous awards for his work from the Defense Ministry and the National Security Council.A darling of the Western media amid the Russian attack on his country, Druzenko is fluent in English and has been readily speaking to the likes of CNN and the New York Post about the work of what these outlets have dubbed the “medical angels.”As Ukrainian civilians join the fight, well-known intellectual Gennadiy Druzenko has fired up an ambulance corps.Our conversation, from today’s GPS: pic.twitter.com/lQh98Xo2BRBefore the conflict, Druzenko undertook several stints at various Western institutions, serving as regional director for a USAID-funded project in Ukraine in the early 2010s, according to his CV. He also worked as a researcher at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, in the US, from 2009 to 2010, and at the Max Planck Institute, in Germany, in 2010.During his interview with Ukrainian TV, Druzenko acknowledged that his unit had a “military wing” composed of ex-commandos, and that his team had been jokingly calling themselves the “First Volunteer Mobile Storm Unit” because of it.“We treat ours and turn theirs into fertilizer. Unwelcome guests have never been loved on this soil,” he said. He claimed Americans had been telling him they were jealous of Ukraine because they were “afraid to fight against the Russians and we are not.”He also touted his long experience fighting for the Ukrainian cause, saying that, since 2014, “the enemy has not changed and the means of war have not changed.”Earlier in March, Amnesty International called on the Ukrainian government to protect Russian POWs from public humiliation, as obliged by the Third Geneva Convention. Its statement was released in response to numerous videos of prisoners on social media and to Kiev’s policy of bringing them to press conferences to speak about their roles in the Russian offensive and to plead with their family at home not to support it."

However, prices refuse to come down for those in California.","On Tuesday, the average cost of gas per gallon reached $6.01 in Los Angeles, the highest number in the nation. Surrounding counties in the Golden State include costs of $5.97 in Orange County, $5.95 in Ventura County, and $5.90 in Bernardino County. The average for the rest of the state comes to $5.86 per gallon. Industry watchers suggest that the drastic spike is due to flaring at PBF Energy refineries located in Torrance, Martinez, and Valero outside of San Francisco. Flaring is a safety device used by refineries to prevent “overpressure” of equipment. Planned flaring is scheduled, but unplanned flaring is used for emergencies caused by equipment failure or other unexpected events. According to Patrick De Haan, head analyst at GasBuddy, the California refineries could be experiencing computer or valve issues which have caused them to use flaring as a safety solution, but that is reportedly just a guess, as refineries do not willingly release that kind of information. Even if refineries in California get their safety issues under control, De Haan says it’s not certain that will bring the costs of gas down, considering other global issues such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic. California is also known to have higher gas costs on average, considering their strict environmental laws and taxes on motor fuels as a means of curbing CO2 emissions and protecting the environment as humanity continues to avoid addressing its climate crisis. A decrease in California’s gas supply would likely affect other states on the West Coast, such as Oregon and Washington, as the two Pacific Northwest states may soon see the same price gouging by the fossil fuel industry in Los Angeles. An increasing number of Californians may be turning away from gasoline as an option. “Demand destruction” is when prices are so high that consumers choose to do away with their purchase of that product. ""Above $4 per gallon, you do see the American public change their driving habits. And we do actively see demand destruction,"" says Regina Mayor, global head of energy at KPMG. Californians have been turning toward electric vehicles to avoid price spikes at the pump. And while some EVs are more expensive, such as Teslas or BMWs, other brands, including Volkswagen, are more affordable due to monthly rebates that the state offers consumers, like the California Clean Fuel Reward, as well as federal rebates. Michael Macias, who became California’s millionth EV owner in December 2021,  said the cost of gas played a major role in his decision to purchase an EV. Macias used $9,500 in state rebates, $750 from the California Clean Fuel Reward, $7,500 in federal rebates, and, because he is a resident of San Joaquin Valley in Central California, he gets $3,000 rebates from the Air Pollution Control District to purchase his electric Volkswagen. Macias says that after he factored in the cost of gas compared to the monthly car payments for his new EV, for him, the choice was clear. “So those are the two things that I was thinking about, along with the fact that I am committed to being a good steward of the land,” Macias said. “This is part of me living into those principles and values.” Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Albright, the 64th U.S. Secretary of State and the first woman to hold that position, passed away earlier today. The cause was cancer,” said a statement posted on Albright’s Twitter account by her relatives.The family called Albright a “tireless champion of democracy and human rights” and a refugee “who rose to the heights of American policy-making, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012, the nation's highest civilian honor.”At the time of her death, Albright was a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, head of the consulting firm Albright Stonebridge Group, and chair of the National Democratic Institute and the US Defense Policy Board, a civilian Pentagon advisory group.Albright served as the US secretary of state – the first woman ever to hold the job – during President Bill Clinton’s second term, 1997-2001. During the Democrat’s first term, she represented Washington in the UN.As the ambassador, Albright infamously defended the US-led campaign of sanctions against Iraq, telling Lesley Stahl of ‘60 Minutes’ in May 1996 that “We think the price is worth it” when asked about half a million children that reportedly died as a result.In February 1998, she defended Clinton’s bombing of Iraq by calling the US “the indispensable nation” that has the right to use force, adding, “We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future, and we see the danger here to all of us.”She was born Marie Jana Korbelova in Czechoslovakia in 1937. Her father Josef worked as a diplomat at the Czech embassy in what was then Yugoslavia. After Nazi Germany occupied Czechoslovakia, Korbel fled with his family to the UK and renounced his Jewish faith to become a Catholic. He returned to Belgrade as an ambassador in 1945, but sent his daughter to a boarding school in Switzerland, where she was nicknamed “Madeleine” – reportedly after the tea biscuit. By 1948, Korbel and his family once again fled to the West, this time to the US.Madeleine became a naturalized US citizen in 1957, and married Joseph Medill Patterson Albright – scion of the Medill Patterson publishing empire – in 1959. They had two daughters, but divorced in the 1980s. In the late 1960s, Albright attended graduate school at New York’s Columbia University, where she studied under Zbigniew Brzezinski – who later recruited her for the White House when he became President Jimmy Carter’s national security adviser. "

US officials have denied claims that Ukrainian research labs were working on biological weapons, contradicting documents published by Russia. However, American officials did confirm the labs' existence.Beijing has refused to sanction Russia over its actions in Ukraine. The Chinese government has publicly affirmed Ukraine’s right to territorial integrity, but has highlighted NATO’s continued expansion into Eastern Europe as a key factor behind the current conflict.Stoltenberg said that NATO leaders will “address the role of China” during Thursday’s conference, and will ask the Asian superpower to “live up to its responsibilities as a member of the UN Security Council” and “refrain from supporting Russia’s war effort and join the rest of the world in calling for an immediate, peaceful end to this war.”China’s diplomats have already called for a negotiated settlement to the war, but are unlikely to join NATO in outright condemning Russia. Beijing has already rejected similar demands by Stoltenberg last week, citing NATO’s bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Serbia in 1999 as one reason it won’t listen to a “lecture on justice from the abuser of international law.”Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng declared last week that NATO could have averted war in Ukraine by pursuing a different path after the fall of the USSR. A simple “commitment of no eastward expansion could have easily ended the crisis and stopped the suffering,” he said, reiterating an argument made repeatedly by Moscow in recent years.China, India, Pakistan, South Africa and 30 other countries abstained from a United Nations General Assembly resolution earlier this month condemning Russia’s offensive in Ukraine. Since opting for neutrality, some of these countries have come under pressure from the US to reverse their decision and back the West."

The ambassador also said Russia is asking Ukraine not to attack any critical infrastructure objects or place any heavy military equipment in residential and densely-populated areas to ensure the protection of humanitarian and medical personnel, the wounded and the ill, and of civilians, as well as ensure the humane treatment of detainees. In addition, Nebenzia said that Moscow calls on all parties not to politicize the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. On Wednesday, the UN Security Council rejected a humanitarian resolution from Russia that called for a negotiated ceasefire in Ukraine. Only Russia and China voted in favor of the resolution, while 13 members of the UN Security Council, including the US, the UK and France - abstained from voting on Russia's draft resolution, and no countries voted against. The resolution condemned all of the violations of international humanitarian law and human rights, including the Geneva Conventions. It also demanded respect and protection for the medical and humanitarian personnel on both sides of the ongoing conflict who are exclusively engaged in medical and related duties in Ukraine. Chinese envoy Zhang Jun stated after the vote that the failure of the UNSC vote for a Russian-drafted resolution regarding the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine is regrettable. The UN Security Council has recently held a series of discussions about the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine to demilitarize and de-Nazify the country after the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics requested military assistance to defend themselves from the intensifying attacks from Ukrainian troops in the regions.

However, he told Belarusian TV he soon came under surveillance there and opted to move on.The former handbag manufacturer was detained by border guards upon trying to cross into Belarus in August, and subsequently requested asylum. Belarus does not have an extradition treaty with the US.Neumann made a memorable (and possibly tongue-in-cheek) appearance on state media in November describing the difficulties of his voyage, from the “very challenging” process of escaping from the “quicksand” he’d supposedly fallen into, to the “swamps, boars, snakes, quagmires” he’d had to dodge in the course of his journey on foot through Pripyat, the Chernobyl exclusion zone – all of which was “new to me, of course.”While the indictment against Neumann claims he was captured on video assaulting a law enforcement officer outside the Capitol, Neumann has maintained his innocence throughout, calling the charges – especially the accusation of hitting a police officer – “offensive”. He was reportedly identified in the footage by a “family friend,” who called an FBI tip line to report his name and hometown of Mill Valley, California.During his appearance on Belarusian state TV, he claimed he would face torture at the hands of the authorities, arguing he needed “government protection” and praising Belarus for “resist[ing] the West.” He promised at the time to be a “productive and good citizen,” suggesting he might get a job in IT and lamenting that both Belarus and Russia were being demonized by western media, calling the sanctions on both countries “a form of terrorism.”"

The initiative is meant to deprive Moscow of the opportunity to mitigate the effects of Western sanctions on its economy by monetizing other assets, in an effort to punish the Kremlin for its military action in Ukraine.“Russia’s massive gold supply is one of the few remaining assets that Putin can use to keep his country’s economy from falling even further. By sanctioning these reserves, we will further isolate Russia from the world’s economy and increase the difficulty of Putin’s increasingly-costly military campaign,” King explained.The American politicians behind the initiative believe that Moscow is using gold to hinder the devaluation of its national currency, the ruble. Washington is concerned that vast gold reserves allow the Kremlin to purchase other currencies on the international market.“Secretary Yellen regularly meets with members of Congress to discuss legislation. Additionally, Treasury staff frequently provide technical assistance on sanctions bills,” a Treasury Department spokesperson said.On March 8, the same group of US senators introduced a bill designed to close this loophole in the sanctions that allows Russians to trade gold. The bill is titled “Stop Russian GOLD,” which stands for “Stop Russian Government and Oligarchs from Limiting Democracy.” If adopted, the legislation will allow the US government to apply secondary sanctions to anyone selling or buying the gold that belongs to Russia’s central bank.Russia’s Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov has previously declared that Moscow has lost access to nearly $300 billion worth of its reserves because of US and EU sanctions. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia Sergey Lavrov said that freezing the assets of the Central Bank amounts to “theft”. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has described anti-Russian sanctions as “a total undisguised aggression” and “a war waged by economic, political, and informational means.”"

It's time to understand that our country, unlike the United States, is doing everything to stop war crimes,"" Antonov said, answering media questions published by the Russian Embassy in the US on Telegram. Commenting on allegations by US Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland on the responsibility for the deaths of tens of thousands of Ukrainians and Russian soldiers, the ambassador said that ""such cynical rhetoric of the US Department of State representative is unacceptable."" Earlier in the day, commenting on new sanctions imposed on Russia by the US, which included sanctions against members of the Russian State Duma, Antonov said that the actions are ""another example of obscuring the reality."" According to Antonov, the new sanctions are aimed to ""destroy the economy and undermine the political situation"" in Russia. ""Trampling on their own slogans about freedom of speech and democracy, the US authorities want to gag all dissenters,"" he added. The ambassador promised that ""serial sanctions strikes"" will ultimately fail at achieving their goal. Antonov called on America to solve its own problems, and not to assert themselves at the expense of Russia. A number of countries around the world have introduced new sanctions against Russia due to the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. According to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, Western sanctions are very serious, but Moscow knew they were coming and prepared in advance. He added that retaliatory measures are being developed in close coordination between various government departments to meet the national interests.   Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the policy of containment and weakening of his administration is a long-term strategy of the West, and sanctions have dealt a serious blow to the global economy. According to Putin, the primary goal of the entire culture and society of the West is to worsen the lives of millions of people.  Putin also said that the US and the EU had defaulted on their obligations to Russia by freezing its foreign exchange reserves. He added that current events underline the West's global dominance in politics and finance. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

He specified that the areas that could be targeted include Russia's banking sector, as well as oil and gas. Asked about what Putin could do so that the US lifts its sanctions, Singh said that it does not appear likely in the foreseeable future. ""Well, we're nowhere near that point. The first thing he has to do is to stop - a reckless and barbaric attack on the civilians of Ukraine. That's not happening,"" Singh said. He projected that Russia’s economy ""is gonna be half of its size that it was before"" the start of the special military operation in Ukraine. Asked about whether the true purpose of sanctions is to force a change of power in Russia, Singh said that ""our purpose, is to make sure that Putin's actions are remembered as a strategic failure."" Nonetheless, he said that US officials are ""not cowboys and cowgirls pressing buttons to destroy an economy,"" although the White House does want ""to demonstrate resolve, that sanctions should have the power to impose overwhelming costs on your target."" Singh refused to give any details on how the White House could react if Beijing starts to actively support Moscow. In the early hours of February 24, Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine after the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for help in defending themselves against the Kiev forces. Russia said that the aim of its special operation is to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine and that only military infrastructure is being targeted. Moscow has repeatedly stressed that it has no plans to occupy Ukraine. In response to Russia’s operation, Western countries have rolled out a comprehensive sanctions campaign against Moscow, which includes airspace closures and restrictive measures targeting numerous Russian officials and entities, media, and financial institutions.

The release will last for the next six months, totaling roughly 182 million barrels of oil.  The reserve's capacity is 727 million barrels, according to the US Department of Energy, spread out in storage facilities across the United States. The decision comes as petroleum prices on international markets remain at elevated levels, with Brent Crude trading at $108.6 per barrel on Thursday. In the US, gasoline prices have also spiked, averaging $4.26 per gallon across the United States on Thursday, according to the American Automotive Association (AAA). On March 8, US President Joe Biden announced the US would boycott Russian petroleum in response to Russia launching a special ""neutralization"" operation in Ukraine. Oil prices had already risen sharply in anticipation of the operation, the disruption it would cause to Russian gas exports, and the retaliation threatened by the West if the operation went ahead. The US has already released a considerable amount of oil from its reserve in recent months in response to rising gasoline prices, which have helped push inflation to its highest level in 40 years. However, after announcing the boycott, Biden announced a massive release of 30 million barrels of oil from the reserve. "

Both Gordon Brown and John Major are among some 140 high-profile signatories to a declaration calling for a ""special international war crimes tribunal"" to be set up to ""arrest Putin and bring him to trial"". Signatories include Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Benjamin Ferencz, a 102-year-old Hungarian-born jurist who was chief prosecutor for the US Army at one of the post-WWII trials of Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg. In a column for Saturday's Daily Mail, Brown claimed ""Such a tribunal would show we are serious and close off a loophole in international law that Putin could use to dodge justice"" — although he did not explain how it could arrest the sitting head of state of a country which did not recognise its jurisdiction. A recent online petition demanded the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecute the Putin ""regime"" for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, ""as well as Russia’s oligarchs and his enablers"". But, like the US and Israel, Russia is not a party to the Rome statutes that recognise the authority of the ICC, a court that has famously only ever prosecuted African leaders. Over the past two weeks, the Ukrainian government has accused the Russian Air Force of bombing a maternity hospital and theatre in Mariupol, a city in Donetsk oblast occupied by the neo-Nazi Azov battalion of the Ukrainian territorial army, killing and injuring civilians.  The Russian Ministry of Defence has insisted it carried out no strikes on the city on the days in question and accused Ukraine of staging ""false flag"" bombings as a provocation. It pointed to media reports from February that Azov militants had evicted patients and staff from the hospital and turned it into a military strongpoint. Brown drew a direct parallel with the Nuremberg tribunals, where Soviet military prosecutors led the charge against Hermann Goering and other surviving Nazi leaders. ""From Britain — which rightly prides itself on democracy and the rule of law — the message must go out. At Nuremberg we held the Nazi war criminals to account"", Brown wrote, skipping over Russia's role in de-Nazifying Europe. ""Eight decades on, we must ensure there will be a day of reckoning for Putin"". Before becoming PM in 2007, Brown served as chancellor and effective number two to his predecessor Tony Blair from 1997 onwards. He budgeted funds for Britain's participation in three unprovoked military offensives: the 1999 bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, and the invasions and occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq. Major was prime minister during Britain's participation the 1991 Gulf War. During that conflict, a US-led coalition air raid targeted the Amiriyah civilian bomb shelter in Baghdad, killing 1,500 civilians, mostly women and children. The coalition forces also left Iraq strewn with toxic depleted uranium munitions. Neither former PM has ever been charged with or even investigated for war crimes. "

His most recent book is Decolonising the University: The Challenge of Deep Cognitive Justice and he is the recipient of the 2022 Frantz Fanon Lifetime Achievement Award to discuss Europe’s complicity in the crisis in Ukraine by ignoring the longstanding problem of NATO aggression against Russia and the weaponization of Ukraine, the prioritization of financial interests by European governments over their people in failing to take any action to prevent conflict on the continent, the United States use of Europe as a junior partner and its historic domination over European affairs, and how the US rivalry with China factors into the US domination of Europe. In the second segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Brian Mier, co-editor of Brasil Wire and author of Year of Lead: Washington, Wall Street and the New Imperialism in Brazil to discuss the history of Nazi ideology in Brazil and the effort to “Ukrianize” Brazil by increasing the influence of neo-Nazis in the country, the communication and assistance that Ukrainian neo-Nazis provide to Brazilian neo-Nazis and Jair Bolsonaro’s connections to the ideology, and what this “Ukrainization” effort might mean in Brazil’s upcoming presidential elections. In the third segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Justin Williams, co-host of Red Spin Sports to discuss Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred’s comments admitting that he failed to build relationships with players and his efforts to change baseball and “fix” the game to make more money for the team owners, what Manfred’s many failures including the lockout mean for his future as the MLB commissioner, Lia Thomas’ historic victory in NCAA swimming and the transphobic discussion around her that has grown more vitriolic over time, and Red Star Belgrade fans holding a banner highlighting NATO interventions amid the current crisis of NATO aggression and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Later in the show, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Chuck Modiano, justice journalist and Sports writer for Deadspin to discuss recent protests at Howard University by non-tenured and adjunct faculty calling for better pay and how it connects to recent student protests over housing conditions on campus, the extremely bellicose rhetoric of the mainstream media toward Russia and its pushing of a no fly zone over Ukraine, and the weaponization and fake concern for women’s sports only when transgender women win.

The crash itself, from what we know so far, also seems weird. We only have initial reports, but the local emergency management department said it lost contact with the plane at 2:15. Five minutes later, the plane went into a deep dive at its cruising speed, AP says, “The data suggests the plane crashed within a minute and a half of whatever went wrong.” Next, Nicolas Davies, independent journalist, a researcher with CODEPINK, and the author of Blood on Our Hands: The American Invasion and Destruction of Iraq joins the show to talk about how Saturday marked the 19th anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq, a war that technically ended in 2017, but in reality is still ongoing. More than one million Iraqis were killed and there was barely a mention of it in the US media. Also, over the weekend, Yemen’s Houthis launched missile attacks on Saudi oil installations in Yanbu and elsewhere, damaging facilities, but causing no injuries. And, the US announced that it would send Patriot surface-to-air missiles to Saudi Arabia to protect it against future Houthi attacks. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad made a surprise trip to the United Arab Emirates. It was his first visit there since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2009 and Assad’s third trip abroad in that period. He met with the Crown Prince and leader of Dubai. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky remotely addressed the Israeli Knesset to ask for Israeli assistance and for the Israelis to impose sanctions on Russia. He received a polite response but no promises. Later in the show, Kimberly Dvorak, investigative journalist and political analyst covering foreign policy joins the show to talk about the split in the Republican Party between anti-war conservatives and neoconservatives. Senator Liz Cheney was on one of the Sunday morning talk shows calling for a No-Fly Zone. The Misfits talk about whether the rift is going to be a political problem for the Republicans campaigning in the 2022 midterms. Then, Daniel McDaniels, Executive Director of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity. He has advised members of congress on foreign affairs, civil liberties and defense/intel policy calls in to talk about President Volodomyr Zelensky announced yesterday that 11 political parties would have to cease activity in the country. Most are small, but one is the country’s largest opposition party. The parties are accused of having links to Russia, though the new leader of the largest party, Opposition Party for Life, earlier this month called for an immediate ceasefire and for Russian troops to leave the country. For the last segment, Kim Keenan, adjunct Professor at George Washington University and Former General Counsel of the NAACP joins the show to talk about an interesting opinion piece in the Washington Post last week which presented two important cases before the Supreme Court that could affect the power and impunity of law enforcement. As it summed up, In one case the court will consider whether federal law enforcement agents who clearly, knowingly and willingly violate someone’s constitutional rights can even be held financially liable. In the other, it will decide whether two doctors should be held criminally culpable and imprisoned for 20 or more years based on law enforcement officials’ opinions about proper medical treatment — even if the doctors believed they were acting in their patients’ best interests. So we have a case about how law enforcement can be punished for brutality and how law enforcement should be involved in the opioid crisis.

A leading factor behind this is the one-sided coverage of the crisis by the country's main news outlets. ","Israel hasn't taken an official anti-Russian stance since Moscow began a special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February. Although it has so far absorbed thousands of Ukrainian refugees, set up a makeshift hospital in western Ukraine, and provided its people with humanitarian assistance, Israel has refrained from joining Western sanctions. Tel Aviv's also not agreed to provide Kiev with military equipment. But that isn't the case with Israel's media. Local newspapers and channels have bashed the Russian operation, presenting it as President Vladimir Putin's desire to resurrect the past glory of the Soviet Union. The press has portrayed the Ukrainian government as victims and its armed forces as a strong army, fighting for its survival. Russia's position is never heard. This biased coverage of the conflict has done the trick. According to a poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute, 67 percent of Israelis felt Russia was responsible for the situation in Ukraine. But Guy Even-Tzur was not one of them. Even-Tzur, who has been following the situation for years, says he is well aware of the atrocities the Ukrainian Army perpetrated against its own people in Donbass, a region in the east of the country, bordering Russia. He is also aware of the Ukrainian government's ambition to join NATO, an organisation that has been challenging Russia for years, and says he understands the logic behind Putin's actions. His sympathy, however, doesn't lie with the Ukrainians for yet another reason - the Holocaust. On the eve of World War II there were 2.7 million Jews in the Soviet Republic of Ukraine. Between June 1941 to May 1945, some 1.5 million were murdered. Many at the hands of Nazi collaborators, including Ukrainians. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who spoke to Israeli parliamentarians a week ago, was trying to tell a different story. He claimed his people were helping Jews during the Holocaust, and he has called on the Israeli government to follow suit and extend a helping hand to Ukrainians, who are fighting ""Russian aggressors"". His comments were slammed by many Israeli politicians and individuals, and Even-Tzur says he shares their criticism. But what he also says is that Israel should not be going the extra mile to help Kiev, especially because it might jeopardise the Jewish state's relations with Moscow. Aside from enjoying stable cultural and economic ties, Israel and Russia have also been cooperating on a number of security projects. Moscow has played a pivotal role in the mediation between officials in Jerusalem and those in the Gaza Strip, and it has also coordinated actions on the Syrian front to avoid potential collisions over Syrian skies.

The products affected will also include pet food and coffee, making up the “vast majority of volume and sales” in Russia, which totalled $1.82 billion in 2021, a company spokesperson confirmed.Nestle noted it will not slash activities in Russia completely, but it will only focus on basic products, such as baby food and medical nutrition, “and not on making a profit.”The company explained the move is a response to Russia’s ongoing military operation in Ukraine. The US and its allies are pressuring global firms to cut ties with the country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and a number of Ukrainian politicians recently criticized the firm for its continued presence in Russia, while hactivist group Anonymous called for a Nestle boycott. It remains unclear how barring chocolates and cat food will pressure Moscow stop the conflict in Ukraine.Earlier this month, Nestle had halted deliveries of some non-essential products to Russia, ceasing investments and advertising campaigns in the country. The company said it will donate all profits from Russia to Ukrainian relief efforts.Nestle has seven production sites in Russia, including confectionery factories, a pet food factory, baby food site and a coffee factory. The firm said it will continue to pay its roughly 7,000 Russian employees.On March 11, US company Mars, which also makes confectionery goods and pet food, announced it will suspend activities in the country. Overall, some 400 companies have halted work in Russia since the start of the operation in Ukraine, including food, beverage, household chemicals and clothing manufacturers.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

They have rejected Kiev’s repeated pleas to provide it with aircraft, however, or to implement a no-fly-zone, which would mean shooting down Russian warplanes flying over Ukraine.Another reported subject of internal debate is direct dialogue with Moscow. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have held several phone calls with Putin since the start of the Russian offensive in Ukraine on February 24. Some NATO members believe these efforts to mediate for peace are “counterproductive and could play into Putin’s hands,” Bloomberg said, citing a document.The UK, Poland, and many Central and Eastern European countries were described as being “skeptical” that Russia was seriously pursuing peace. Some were also quoted as believing that a deal without the full withdrawal of Russian troops would “serve Putin.”Two officials, meanwhile, were quoted as saying that Scholz had cautioned other NATO members against abandoning the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act. Berlin is of the view that the channels of communication between NATO and Russia outlined in the document “could still be needed some day,” according to the report.Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are meeting for a new round of peace talks in the Turkish capital, Istanbul, on Tuesday.Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev says the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the Donbass by force."

Do you know about this? You don’t. But I can tell you that such an option is being considered,” Rogozin told journalists on Saturday.However, he said one shouldn’t “get too nervous” were Washington to make such a move, as Russia has its own GLONASS positioning system, which is connected to every smartphone and remains operational.No officials in Washington have yet publicly mentioned the possible disconnection of Russia from GPS as part of restrictions against the country.Sanctions pressure on Moscow by the US, EU and their allies has been further intensified in the wake of the military operation in Ukraine. Among other things, the drastic new curbs have seen Russia being excluded from the global SWIFT payment system, having a huge portion of its foreign exchange reserves frozen, and witnessing numerous foreign brands leaving the local market.Moscow sent its troops into the neighboring country in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the breakaway Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

This adds to over 4,000 anti-tank weapons, including Javelin and NLAW missiles, already sent to Kiev.The BBC, meanwhile, will receive an extra £4.1 million ($5.4 million) for its Ukrainian and Russian language services, and to “counter disinformation about the war in Ukraine.” Russia’s media regulator, Roskomnadzor, accused the BBC of spreading misinformation about the Russian military campaign in Ukraine and blocked access to its website in early March.The UK will work to “step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defenses as they turn the tide in this fight,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. “We can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world.”NATO member states will meet on Thursday to discuss further responses to Russia’s campaign in Ukraine, including more lethal aid. Swedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist said that his country will provide 5,000 anti-tank weapons, while Deutsche Presse-Agentur reported on Wednesday that Germany plans to send an additional 2,000 anti-tank weapons.Western countries, however, have so far rejected Ukraine’s repeated pleas to shoot down Russian warplanes flying over the country, fearing direct confrontation with Moscow. The US also declined Poland’s offer to supply Kiev with Soviet-era combat aircraft.Moscow attacked Ukraine exactly one month ago, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

They also asked city officials to assess the value of the material the monument is made from, and see if it can be used “for the benefit of the victims of the Russian attack on Ukraine.”“It’s unsettling that, in the heart of Berlin, we’re honoring a person who was antidemocratic,” David Paul, a spokesman for the local CDU branch, said. “It’s also about the fact that now we have a war in Europe led by a man who uses democracy as a fig leaf,” he added, apparently referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Paul said the monument was “not entirely worthless,” because, according to him, the sale of bronze could bring between €1.5-2 million ($1.6-2.1 million).A former leader of the German Communist Party, Thalmann was imprisoned in the Buchenwald concentration camp and executed by the Nazis in 1944, reportedly on Adolf Hitler’s personal order. The monument by Soviet sculptor Lev Kerbel was unveiled in 1986. The bronze sculpture stands on a massive pedestal made of marble that was mined in Ukraine.The idea to do away with the monument received a mixed response. Hannah Wettig from the Green Party backed the move, arguing that a site dedicated to Thalmann would only make sense “as a part of a memorial that clearly names the crimes of Stalinism.”Berlin Deputy Mayor and Senator for Culture Klaus Lederer, who is a member of the Die Linke (The Left) party, however, told Berliner Morgenpost that “there are better ways of helping Ukraine, without the destruction of cultural property.” He added that Soviet-era monuments remain under state protection.Felix Reifschneider of the liberal Free Democratic Party accused Paul of “populism,” while his colleague, Thomas Enge, said that the questions surrounding the monument should not be mixed with the “suffering in Ukraine.”The memorial has long been an issue of debate. In 1993, city officials voted to demolish it, but the decision was never carried out due to the estimated high cost of the removal of the 50-ton structure.Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two Donbass republics by force."

Skyrocketing commodity prices are sending the costs of consumer goods, energy, and food ever higher, giving rise to fears of a possible recession in many countries and even hunger in some parts of the world.Russia’s decision to switch payments to its domestic currency has been made in response to the unprecedented penalties imposed by the US and its allies on the country’s financial system.The ruble plummeted to record lows after Western nations and Japan blocked Russia’s access to some of its international reserves. Since last week’s currency-switch announcement, the ruble has reached its strongest level against the US dollar and the euro in nearly a month.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

After detailing such perils as civilian casualties and struggles to evacuate the wounded, he noted that German soldiers killed during World War II are buried in the city.“Our city is being wiped off the face of the earth,” Atroshenko told reporters. “Only the Nazis did this. In Chernihiv there is a cemetery of Germans who died here during the Second World War. We support it.” I want the Germans to hear this. Russia, which you continue to support, is bombing the graves of your grandfathers.By support, Atroshenko meant that Germany is continuing to buy Russian oil, natural gas and coal, even as NATO members try to isolate Moscow and crush its economy through sanctions. Chernihiv, located northeast of Kiev, has been one of the cities hit hardest by the Russian military offensive. Less than half of its population of about 290,000 remains in the city.Ukrainian leaders have pointed to various motivations in their campaign for international support, accusing Russia of attacks on civilians and painting Kiev as a defender of freedom. The Nazi graves are apparently a new and ironic wrinkle in those efforts.President Vladimir Putin ordered the offensive last month, saying Russia would “demilitarize” and “denazify” the Kiev government. US President Joe Biden took issue with that claim in a speech on Saturday in Warsaw, saying it was “obscene” to speak about “denazifying” Ukraine because President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish.However, Kiev has embraced a number of World War II Nazi collaborators, such as Stepan Bandera. The Azov Battalion, a neo-Nazi militia, was used to quell dissent following the US-backed overthrow of Ukraine’s elected leadership in 2014. Far-right nationalists helped lead the coup and took positions of power, such as deputy prime minister, in the new government.As for civilian casualties, Russian officials have said Moscow is using precision weapons and hitting only military targets. Mayor Atroshenko acknowledged that most of those wounded in Chernihiv are military casualties.More than 1,100 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since the offensive began, according to a United Nations estimate. Upward of 3.7 million people have fled the country."

The foreign ministers of Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan were also present, along with observers from Indonesia and Qatar.“I consider it significant progress that the Ukrainian negotiators confirmed the need to ensure a non-nuclear, non-aligned status of Ukraine and its security outside the framework of NATO, as well as the Ukrainian colleagues’ understanding that the issues of Crimea and the Donbass have been permanently resolved,” he told reporters in Tunxi.Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko disagreed with Lavrov’s statement, however, saying the Russian diplomat “demonstrates a misunderstanding of the negotiation process.”“The issues of Crimea and Donbas will be settled for good after Ukraine restores its sovereignty over them,” Nikolenko tweeted. “During the talks in Istanbul, the Ukrainian delegation presented its proposals on how to achieve this goal.”Monday’s peace talks in Istanbul saw Kiev commit for the first time in writing to several key points Russia insisted on for good-neighborly relations, namely foregoing NATO membership and nuclear weapons, according to chief Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky, who himself was born in Ukraine. While Kiev did not outrightly recognize the independence of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, and Crimea’s 2014 decision to rejoin Russia, Medinsky said that Kiev was willing to negotiate on those points. The Kremlin later said that Crimea’s status is not a subject of negotiations at all, explaining that it's an internal part of Russia.All three regions seceded from Ukraine following the 2014 Western-backed Maidan in Kiev. Crimea voted in a referendum to rejoin Russia, while the Donetsk and Lugansk regions declared independence. Moscow recognized the Donbass republics last month, citing Kiev’s refusal to implement the Minsk agreements brokered by France and Germany in 2014. The protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

The move follows similar legislation targeting individuals deemed to be spreading “fake news” about the actions of the country's military forces.On Monday, commenting on the legislation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “unprecedented conditions require unprecedented solutions.” He explained that the current situation can be described as unprecedented ""in terms of imposing absolute hatred on everything Russian, whether it is Russian missions, Russian citizens, or foreign citizens [who] are of Russian origin.""“Everyone now faces just hatred, oppression and situations that sometimes begin to pose a threat to health and life,” he added. On Tuesday, parliamentarians approved the amendments to the Criminal Code and to the Code of Administrative Offenses, both in the second and in the third reading.Once the legislation comes into force, “public dissemination of knowingly false information under the guise of reliable messages” about work of state Russian agencies abroad might be penalized with a fine of 700,000 - 1.5 million rubles (approximately $6,700 – 14,500) or imprisonment for up to three years.The same act committed by somebody who uses an official position, or by a group of people, “with the artificial creation of evidence for the accusation,” “with mercenary motives”, or “based on political, ideological, racial, national or religious hatred or enmity,” could be punished with a fine of 3 - 5 million rubles (appr. $28,800 – 48,400) or imprisonment for 5-10 years.“If the mentioned acts caused grave consequences, they will be punished by imprisonment for a term of 10 to 15 years,” the Duma announced.In addition to the “dissemination of knowingly false information,” criminal liability will also apply to “public actions aimed at discrediting” the work of Russian entities abroad.According to the legislation’s author, the chair of the Duma’s information policy committee, Alexander Khinstein, Russian diplomats and the employees of Rossotrudnichestvo (Federal Agency for the Commonwealth of Independent States Affairs, Compatriots Living Abroad, and International Humanitarian Cooperation) “are now operating practically in combat conditions.”Earlier this month, Russian lawmakers approved legislation banning the dissemination of ‘fake news’ about Moscow’s military operations in Ukraine. Those found guilty under the law are liable to be placed behind bars for up to 15 years. The media regulator Roskomnadzor also blocked access to several foreign media outlets as well as domestic concerns such as Ekho Moskvy radio and the Dozhd TV channel.Ukraine’s government, meanwhile, on March 19 outlawed 11 political parties, including the parliament’s second-largest group, Opposition Platform – For Life, for its alleged “connections” with Russia. On the same day the country’s President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law introducing a “unified information policy” that provides for the merger of all national news TV channels into a single “round-the-clock information marathon.”Moscow and Kiev have consistently blamed each other for spreading disinformation amid the ongoing military action.Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and Russia’s recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

A minesweeper vessel was dispatched to the area, and it was confirmed it was indeed a mine, the Romanian Defense Ministry said in a statement. It was then examined by a team of divers, who decided to destroy the munition on site with a high-velocity shaped charge.Images released by the Romanian military show a classic ‘horned death’ naval mine apparently of the small anchored mine type – a Soviet-made munition dating back to the WWII-era.Misiune de neutralizare a unei mine marine îndeplinită de marinarii militari româniEliminarea pericolului care plutea în zona de responsabilitate a Forțelor Navale Române a constat în montarea unei încărcături explozive pe mină de către scafandrii EOD și detonarea de la distanță pic.twitter.com/LF3UoXDh8AThe mine appeared to have been freshly painted black with white markings and showed little rust. The device had seemingly not been properly armed, however, and the protective caps covering its detonator ‘horns’ had failed to detach, so it had remained intact while adrift.The latest incident came shortly after another stray naval mine was discovered by the Turkish military close to its maritime border with Bulgaria. A third mine had been scooped up and disposed of by a Turkish SAS team near the Bosphorus Strait on Saturday.The string of incidents involving stray mines comes amid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The issue was first brought to light a week ago by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), which stated that the Ukrainian military had placed anchor mines along its Black Sea coast to prevent a potential amphibious assault by the Russian Navy. A number of the antique, Soviet-made mines had already detached from their cables, the FSB claimed, warning that the munitions could drift across the Black Sea into the Bosphorus Strait and ultimately into the Mediterranean.The allegations were disputed by the Ukrainian side, however, which insisted that the mine scare was nothing but Russian disinformation being used as excuse to close off parts of the sea. Some Ukrainian media outlets went even further, claiming the mines had been placed along the country’s coast by Russia itself."

These are just some of the recommendations made by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in a 10-point action plan aimed at cutting oil consumption “in the face of the emerging global energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”According to IEA estimates, the actions it suggests, should they be implemented, could help reduce oil consumption by 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd) within four months, which would be equivalent to more than half of Russia’s exports. It is estimated that the world consumes nearly 100 million bpd.Among the measures to be enacted immediately, especially by developed nations, are the reduction of speed limits on highways by at least 10km/ph (6mph), and so-called car-free Sundays, with every such day helping to save approximately 380,000 barrels of oil, according to the energy watchdog.The document goes on to point out that car-free Sundays are nothing new, in fact, as similar measures were introduced in countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands, and West Germany at the height of the 1973 oil crisis. Moreover, certain cities have adopted the practice more recently to improve public health, the IEA notes. In addition to the drop in oil consumption per se, car-free Sundays’ positive side effects would include cleaner air, reduced noise pollution, and improved road safety, it adds.In addition, the IEA recommends that those who can work from home up to three days a week do so. Among the other initiatives it advises governments to consider are cheaper public transport and incentives to buy bicycles.In its plan, the IEA points out that besides reducing the “price pain being felt by consumers around the world,” the suggested measures could also help “shrink Russia’s hydrocarbon revenues, and help move oil demand towards a more sustainable pathway.” The paper concludes that the reduction of oil consumption is more than just a short-lived push, and, instead, is crucial for tackling climate change.Following February 24, when Russian troops crossed the Ukrainian border, oil prices have shot up to almost $140 per barrel – levels not seen since 2008."

This act was the opening round of what was to become a 78-day illegal war of aggression, the repercussions of which haunt the world to this day.Act One: The EncounterIt was a chance meeting – two men who had crossed paths in Iraq two years past, now running into each other on a stretch of highway connecting Kosovo to Macedonia. The date was March 20, 1999. Monitors assigned to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) were in the process of being withdrawn from their assigned areas of responsibility to the town of Ohrid, in Macedonia, due to the collapse of diplomatic talks with Serbia about the devolving situation in the Serbian autonomous province of Kosovo, where Albanian separatists were engaged in a quasi-civil war with the Serbian authorities.The British contingent of the KVM was stopped at the border between Kosovo and Macedonia, awaiting final clearance to cross the border. Among the British observers was a former Royal Marine officer who had previously served with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in Iraq, helping oversee the dismantling of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programs. While he and his fellow observers waited, he watched as other vehicles driven by members of the US observer contingent drove in the opposite direction – into Kosovo. At the wheel of one of these vehicles was a familiar face – a man who was known as ‘Kurtz’.Kurtz was a man of tremendous experience who was brought into UNSCOM in mid-1997 for the purpose of providing operational planning and leadership. ‘Kurtz’, of course, was not his real name, but rather a nickname derived from the fact that with his shaved head, walrus mustache, and weathered face, he looked like a combination of Robert Duvall’s Colonel Kilgore and Marlon Brando’s Colonel Kurtz in the movie ‘Apocalypse Now’. With a wide-brim Stetson, cowboy boots, and an ever-present wad of chewing tobacco stuck in his cheek, he looked every bit the part.Kurtz was picked for this job in part because of his background, which was embedded in the world of covert special operations. His most recent assignment prior to coming on board at UNSCOM was preparing diplomats for E&E – escape and evasion – from hostile situations. Given the sensitivity of some of the UNSCOM operations taking place in Iraq at that time, it was thought that such training might be ideal for situations the inspectors might find themselves in.But Kurtz’s background had been his undoing. He was, so to speak, too ‘black’, or covert, for his own good. Even though he was performing wonderfully in Iraq, his managers in Washington began to panic when the situation in Baghdad began to deteriorate in October 1997. The decision was made to pull Kurtz out of Iraq. It was bitter irony – the one man who was best equipped to deal with a hostage situation, to keep not only himself but other, less fully-trained personnel alive and well, was being withdrawn in haste out of fear of his being taken hostage.Once Kurtz was assigned to UNSCOM, he was technically UN property for the duration of the assignment, and the US could not just simply snap its fingers and bring him home. But snap, they did, with the US ambassador, Bill Richardson, summoning the Australian diplomat who headed UNSCOM, Richard Butler, to the US Mission in New York for a meeting. “One of the personnel provided to you [Kurtz],” Richardson said, “is a bit too exposed by the current situation, and we feel that it would be best for us all if he were withdrawn at this time.”I oversaw the team in Iraq that Kurtz and the British officer were assigned to. Butler called me up to his office after his meeting with Richardson. “The man’s CIA,” he told me. “The Americans want him out.”Now, as the Kosovo Monitoring Mission was departing Kosovo, Kurtz was back in action. The Americans, it seemed, wanted this man with the impressive covert operations skill set back in.The role played by the CIA in the OSCE KVM is quite controversial – at a time when the US and NATO were accusing the Serbian government of committing atrocities, the CIA was using the cover provided by the OSCE observer mission to coordinate with fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army who were engaged in a guerilla war with the Serbian military. Serbian operations in response to CIA-directed KLA attacks were being characterized by the West as ‘genocide’, and used to justify a planned NATO aerial bombardment of Serbia.These facts, however, ran counter to the narrative of a Serbian-initiated campaign of ethnic cleansing which the US and NATO were spinning. The British OSCE observers were well aware of the complex reality of what was transpiring inside Kosovo, where legitimate Serbian military operations against known KLA forces were being described as “massacres of innocent civilians” by the Western media. The truth, however, was often inconvenient, which is why at that moment in time, on March 20, 1999, the British observer contingent found itself exiting Kosovo at the same time Kurtz and his fellow CIA officers were going in.Act Two: The Phone CallMarch 24, 1999. 9:20am. In the White House Situation Room, an aid places a phone call to the Kremlin, where Russian President Boris Yeltsin is waiting. The call goes through, and the aid hands the phone to Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the United States. The conversation started off with a grim notification: The leaders of NATO, including himself, Clinton said, “have decided we have to launch air strikes against military targets in Serbia soon.”The problem, Clinton noted, was the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic. “He has displaced 30,000 more people just since last Friday,” Clinton said. “He is killing innocent people. We have reports of summary executions.” Left unspoken was the role played by Kurtz and his fellow CIA operatives in creating the conditions for such actions. Clinton continued. “He [Milosevic] has basically told Russian, EU, and American negotiators that he doesn’t care what any of us think.”Clinton was getting worked up by the consequences he had triggered by unleashing the CIA on Kosovo. “My God, they [the Europeans] have nightmares they’ll [the Serbs] repeat Bosnia and all the instability and all the problems, and it will spread from Kosovo to Macedonia to Albania and engulf all of their southern flank. They are very, very worried about it. They are right to be worried about it.”Again, left unsaid was the fact that the very scenario that was giving the Europeans nightmares had been carefully crafted by the CIA, at Bill Clinton’s direction.Yeltsin wasn’t buying any of it. “It is easy to throw bombs about,” he said, dismissing Clinton’s characterization of the problem and proffered solution. “It is intolerable because of the hundreds of thousands of people who will suffer and die.”The consequences of any NATO strike, Yeltsin warned Clinton, were dire. “In the name of our future, in the name of you and me, in the name of the future of our countries, in the name of security in Europe, I ask you to renounce that strike, and I suggest that we should meet somewhere and develop a tactical line of fighting against Milosevic, against him personally. And we are wiser, we are more experienced, and we can come up with a solution. That should be done for the sake of our relationship. That should be done for the sake of peace in Europe.”The Russian leader’s pleas fell on deaf ears. “Well, Boris,” Clinton replied, “I want to work with you to try and bring an end to this, but I don’t believe there is any way to call off the first round of strikes because Milosevic continues to displace thousands of people every day… I don’t want this to be a great source of a split between Russia and Europe and Russia and the US. We have worked too hard. There are too many economic and political things for us to do together, and I regret this more than I can say.”The American president was outright lying to his Russian counterpart – the events in Kosovo were unfolding along the lines of a carefully scripted game plan that had been in motion for some time. War was inevitable because the US, through the CIA, had shaped the narrative to make it so. Worse, the US president was willing to sacrifice relations between the US and Russia in pursuit of this NATO objective. This fact was driven home by Yeltsin in his closing remarks.“[O]ur people,” Yeltsin lamented, “will certainly from now on have a bad attitude with regard to America and NATO. I remember how difficult it was for me to try and turn heads of our people, the heads of politicians towards the West, towards the United States, but I succeeded in doing that, and now to lose all that. Well, since I failed to convince the President, that means there is in store for us a very difficult, difficult road of contacts, if they prove to be possible. Goodbye.”Act Three: The BombOn the evening of March 24, 1999, the secretary general of NATO, Javier Solana, a Spanish diplomat, authorized aircraft operating under the auspices of NATO to begin bombing targets in Serbia. It was no coincidence that the first aircraft to drop bombs on Serbia were F/A-18s belonging to the Spanish Air Force.When examining the legitimacy of the use of force by Spain against Serbia in March 1999, several facts stick out. First is that Spain, as a member of the United Nations, is bound by its commitment to the Charter of that organization. When it comes to the use of force, the UN Charter is quite clear – there are only two acceptable conditions under which such force might be legitimately employed by a member state. One is an enforcement action to maintain international peace and security, carried under the authority of a resolution passed by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter. The other is the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense, as enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter.As Spanish bombs fell on Serbian soil, two things were quite clear – there was no Chapter VII resolution in existence which authorized an enforcement action against Serbia, and Serbia had committed no act of aggression against either Spain or its NATO allies that would justify any claim of self-defense in explaining the Spanish (and NATO) military assault on Serbia.In short, by dropping bombs on Serbia, the Spanish Air Force was initiating an illegal war of aggression. “To initiate a war of aggression,” the judges who comprised the International Military Tribunal convened in Nuremberg to judge the crimes of Nazi Germany, declared, “is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulative evil of the whole.”Spain wasn’t alone that night – aircraft from the air forces of the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and other NATO members participated in this “supreme international crime.” Viewed individually, there is no doubt that each nation involved in the attack on Serbia violated the UN Charter and, as such, is guilty of the crime of initiating an illegal war of aggression.Not so fast! NATO, it seems, had crafted a novel legal argument built around the notion that it had a right to anticipatory collective self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and that this right was properly exercised under “normative expectation that permits anticipatory collective self-defense actions by regional security or self-defense organizations where the organization is not entirely dominated by a single member.” NATO, ignoring the obvious reality that it is, indeed, dominated by the United States, postulates that it is, indeed, such an organization, comprised as it is of “a number of powerful states, three of which are permanent members of the Security Council.”The credibility of the NATO claim of “anticipatory collective self-defense,” however, arises from its characterization of the Kosovo crisis as a humanitarian disaster infused with elements of genocide which created not only a moral justification for intervention, but a moral necessity.Tell that to Kurtz, the man who, together with his fellow CIA operatives acting under the authority given them by the president of the United States, Bill Clinton, worked to create conditions on the ground inside Kosovo that could then be used to manufacture the very narrative of a humanitarian crisis sufficient in scope and scale to allow NATO to craft its novel legal justification for attacking Serbia.The problem for NATO is that its legal justification was built on a foundation of lies. The fiction that NATO is an organization not entirely dominated by the United States evaporates the moment one understands the role played by the CIA in preparing the script used by NATO to justify its actions. The fact that this script promulgated outright fabrications of alleged crimes perpetrated by Serbia to justify NATO military intervention only underscores the criminal nature of the entire NATO enterprise.There is no escaping the fact that when the first bomb dropped by the Spanish Air Force on Serbia that evening 23 years ago to this date impacted on the ground, Spain and every other member of NATO had committed the “ultimate crime.”That this crime remains unpunished is a travesty of international justice. That this crime remains unrecognized by those who perpetrated it is a testament to the hypocrisy of nations. That this crime set in motion the events that have led to the current state of affairs between the US and NATO on the one hand, and Russia on the other, is a global tragedy."

Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry accused Ukrainian soldiers of using prohibited weapons – a claim that was similarly rebuked by Kiev.The munitions, which cause deadly burns and are highly toxic, are banned under international law.“Russia has never violated any international conventions,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted on Friday.Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s envoy to the UN, similarly claimed that Moscow had long ago disposed of its chemical weapons arsenal, and added that it was “disgraceful” to accuse Moscow of using chemical munitions in Ukraine.Speaking to the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) member states on Thursday via video link, Zelensky claimed that “Russian troops used phosphorous bombs against civilians in Ukraine.” He provided no evidence to back up his assertion. Other Ukrainian officials have made similar allegations.The Russian Defense Ministry claimed in February that Ukrainian soldiers were “massively” using phosphorus munitions outside Kiev while trying to repel the Russian offensive. Zelensky later said that his country had “no chemical weapons or any other forms of weapons of mass destruction.”Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocol had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev says the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

The principle of indivisible security has been addressed by Russia since December 2021, when Moscow rolled out its security proposals to the West. Moscow demanded the alliance not expand eastward to include Ukraine and Georgia, to which Washington replied by insisting it will not allow anyone to slam the alliance's open-door policy shut. Responding to this, Russia pointed at the principle of indivisible security, which states that the security of any state cannot undermine the security of another.  In January, the Russian Foreign Ministry sent letters to each EU country, urging to focus on the principle and work out any ""differences in the understanding of the principle of equal and indivisible security"". However, a response was received only from the bloc, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell saying that Brussels would act as one on all issues of key common interest, including coordinated replies to letters. Moscow said it could not accept a ""collective"" response when it sought feedback from each addressee. Lavrov expressed hope that the current ""abnormal"" situation between Russia and Ukraine will be resolved, but warned that the West is going to prevent this from happening.  Elaborating on the influence that Western countries have on Ukraine, Lavrov pointed at the biological weapons' components purportedly being created in the Eastern European country under US supervision. Lavrov estimated that the United States is seeking a unipolar world where every country will obey the strongest one. Such a view envisages no global village, the Russian foreign minister outlined; it would rather be ""an American village"". He said that Washington has managed to ""mobilise"" the world based on American interests - something that, Lavrov believes, points to the actual scale of ""independence"" of the European Union and NATO members. However, not everyone is ready to agree with that, according to Lavrov. Russia, he said, is also ""not in the category of countries who would be ready to do so"". According to Lavrov, the West continues to wage an ""information war"" against Russia,  trying to present one side of the story behind the Ukrainian conflict. He also pointed at how Washington tries to use TikTok to ""brainwash"" children - something that Lavrov said is ""not fair"". The West's intention is to marginalise Russia, the top diplomat said, using its unprecedented pressure to curb Russia's development. Yet, even in the face of the massive waves of sanctions, Russia will work out the measures to respond and keep improving the country.  The Russian foreign minister said that the country has so far faced over 5,000 individual sanctions - a record that eclipses the restrictions imposed against Iran and North Korea.  What is happening now, Lavrov said, cannot be compared to the amount of sanctions introduced against Moscow after the events of 2014, when Crimea was reunified with Russia, but the experience of that time allowed the country to learn a lesson that helped it prepare for the current situation.  His interview comes amid the ongoing Russian military operation in Ukraine, launched on 24 February. The Kremlin said the goal was to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" its neighbour and protect the people from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics suffering at the hands of the Ukrainian military. The military operation has received strong condemnation from the Wests, with nations imposing harsh sanctions targeting Russian businesses, culture, financial sector, media outlets, and many other areas.

In some cases, the campaign has reached bizarre levels, like banning Russian-themed food or classical literature.","President Vladimir Putin has weighed in on the heights that anti-Russian hysteria has reached in some Western nations, suggesting attempts are being made to “cancel” Russia along the lines of campaigns targeting those who do not “fit into” the modern zeitgeist. “It’s enough to mention the phenomenon of cancel culture, or the public ostracism of, boycott of, or silencing or neglect of facts, books, names, historical and public figures, authors. People who don’t fit in, who can’t be placed in modern templates – however absurd the latter may be,” Putin said, speaking to laureates of awards in culture and art on Friday. Putin pointed out that the last time such a campaign to destroy ‘objectionable literature’ was carried out was in Nazi Germany nearly 90 years ago. Cancel culture did not start yesterday, Putin said, but has reached a point where fundamental norms and values and the laws of nature themselves are being undermined and “broken” in some nations. “In a number of countries, and particularly in the countries of the so-called West, such phenomena have not only penetrated politics, public life, sports, and education, but are also dominant in other spheres, and are aggressively imposed there,” he said. The Eastern Front tied up to eighty percent of Axis military strength during World War II, with the USSR losing 26 million people, including 8.6 million troops who died in battle, and over 17 million civilians and PoWs, in the struggle against Nazi Germany and its allies. The president also recalled another example, pointing out on the day that the Japanese pay remembrance to the atomic bombings of their country, they are made to remain “shamefacedly silent” about who dropped these weapons, or state simply that “some abstract Allies” were responsible. Textbooks for children “simply don’t say that it was the United States that carried out this terrible and unjustified massacre at the end of World War II,” Putin said. Putin suggested that cancel culture is “impossible to imagine” in Russia, and that the country is “insured” against it thanks to its own national culture. “For us, it is inseparably linked to our homeland, to Russia, where there is no place for ethnic discrimination, where representatives of dozens of nationalities and ethnic groups have lived, worked and raised children together for centuries.” Putin also pointed to the role of Russian cultural figures in shaping world civilization over the centuries, calling their contribution “invaluable.” “For centuries, Russian masters of literature, music and fine arts have given humanity not only new aesthetic traditions, but also, very importantly, ideals and meanings that have become moral and spiritual guidelines for millions of people, for entire generations,” he said. Putin expressed hope that the “truth” about Russia would one day be revealed to the world through culture. “I think many people know about and have seen how a street artist in Naples recently drew a portrait of ‘canceled’ Russian writer Fedor Dostoyevsky. This gives me hope that through the mutual sympathies of people, through the culture that binds and unites all of us, the truth will breakthrough; that art and education will sow only intelligence, kindness and the eternal, as should be the case,” Putin concluded. The Russian military operation in Ukraine has sparked a dizzying campaign of both centralized and spontaneous efforts to ‘cancel’ and ban everything Russian abroad, from Russian vodka and dumplings, to performers, musicians, artists and athletes. Even long-dead Russian authors and composers have not been left unscathed. "

Washington had previously denied the presence of any American-run biolabs in the country.","Mathieu B, a French neo-Nazi activist who returned from Ukraine, where he had been living for several years, was indicted on Sunday in Paris for racist ""insults"" and ""provocations"", according to news agency AFP, citing a judicial source. According to French newspaper Le Monde, Mathieu B had been the subject of a complaint filed in October 2021 by the Jewish Observatory of France (l'Observatoire Juif de France), an association with an online reporting platform exercising discreet surveillance to unearth signs of supremacist militant ideology. Accordingly, the man was monitored as part of an investigation by Paris' Central Office for Combating Crimes Against Humanity, Genocide and War Crimes (l'Office central de lutte contre les crimes contre l'humanite, les genocides et les crimes de guerre (OCLCH)). The French inter-ministerial service gendarmes have a unit dedicated to online hate. According to the report on the internet, Mathieu B called himself ""the great monarch"" or ""Saint-Claude 88"", these last two numbers being a neo-Nazi reference. The number 88 represents the phrase “Heil Hitler” because H is the eighth letter in the alphabet. The man is believed to have been communicating over the internet with like-minded individuals, and challenging opponents of his “virulent anti-Semitism” and a plethora of far-fetched conspiracy theories he is believed to have embraced. Once the Russian operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine began, Mathieu B opted to flee his adopted country, together with his wife and children. OCLCH gendarmes were notified on 28 February, four days after the start of the Russian operation in Ukraine, that Mathieu B had crossed the Hungarian border in a car, with his family. Assisted by their colleagues from the Marseille surveillance group, the OCLCH officers arrested the 37-year old on 18 March on a public highway in the south of France. After a judicial investigation opened on 20 March, the man was “indicted on the same day for counts of racial insults and incitement to hatred and racist discrimination by electronic means”, then placed under judicial control, said the judicial source who was cited. Although this particular case is not linked to foreign mercenaries, it comes as Russia has repeatedly warned foreign countries against allowing their citizens to travel to Ukraine to take part in hostilities. Moscow stressed that anyone firing at Russian troops during the special operation will be considered a valid target. Russia's President Vladimir Putin authorised the launch of the special military operation in Ukraine after a request from the newly recognised Donetsk and Lugansk People's republics (DPR and LPR). Moscow had been left with no other choice after Kiev failed to implement the Minsk agreements and needed to protect the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbass population in the wake of continued attacks by Ukrainian forces.  Western countries led by the US have condemned the operation, branding it an ""invasion"",  expressing readiness to supply Ukraine with weapons, and targeting Moscow with a sanctions campaign. "

The US and EU members have imposed sanctions on Russian financial institutions in response to Moscow’s special military operation in Ukraine.","The Narendra Modi government has approved a proposal forwarded by Moscow that allows Russian firms to invest in debt securities issued by Indian companies.  Sources said that the rules regarding External Commercial Borrowings have been relaxed for the Russian entities to invest in bonds issued by Indian firms. External Commercial Borrowings have benefited Indian Inc. immensely over the years as it is a cheaper source of financing.  Indian firms have raised $31.18 billion in the financial year 2022 against the backdrop of a stable currency and the availability of more affordable funds in the overseas market during the economic crisis. The earnings on the investments would be transferred to the Russian entities in rubles through a decades-old account which has existed with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  This will also reduce the negative impact of rupee devaluation on the cost of borrowings as a strong dollar makes overseas fundraising costlier. On Thursday, Russia’s Trade Representation in India said that a rupee-ruble channel of payments is already operating. Experts have pointed out that sanctions imposed by the US and its allies in response to Moscow’s special military operation do not prohibit facilitating rupee-ruble transactions. The Biden Administration has warned Chinese entities of possible sanctions if they bypass US sanctions on Russia. However, the US remains cautious in making such remarks against India, even as New Delhi stressed that it would purchase oil and gas and operate a rupee-ruble payment mechanism to continue trade transactions with Russia. On Thursday, Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar said in parliament that “there is no question of linking the Ukraine situation to issues of trade”.  However, Aditya Pareek also advised India to remain cautious as the Biden administration may continue to impose additional sanctions in the days to come.  “The implicit threat of secondary US sanctions will remain no matter how craftily India might try to navigate the situation, and this applies to letting Russian entities invest in bonds of Indian companies,” Pareek added. The US announced additional sanctions on more than 400 Russian officials and business people amid ongoing operation by Russian armed forces in Ukraine. The military operation started on 24 February at the request of the people of Donbass, who have been facing Kiev’s aggression for eight years. "

By far the largest expense is military and defense spending. President Joe Biden is requesting $813 billion for the Pentagon, including $13.6 billion earmarked to fund Ukraine’s military efforts during Russia’s special operation in the region. Within the discretionary budget, $813 billion will be spent on defense-related programs, compared to $769 billion for domestic spending. Programs like Social Security and Medicare are not considered part of the discretionary budget because they are self funded and cannot be altered through normal budget proposals. Last year, Biden requested $753 billion for defense, only to have Congress increase that number to $782 billion. That is likely to be the case again as more so-called progressive members of Congress have signaled a willingness to support ever growing military budgets in response to the situation in Ukraine. Republicans will likely target $875 billion as the final defense spending budget, according to an analyst quoted in Defense News. Another larger point of contention in the budget is what could be the largest tax increase by dollar amount in the country’s history. If passed, the tax increase would drastically reduce the deficit, but Republican lawmakers are not likely to support the proposal. As is, the budget includes a $2.5 trillion tax increase on large corporations over the next ten years and a 20% minimum tax on unrealized capital gains for households with a net worth of over $100 million. However, conservative-leaning Democrats such as Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema have opposed similar tax increases in the past, and Democrats declined to include a billionaire tax in last year’s budget proposal.  Without any Republican support, passage would require every Democratic senator and the vast majority of Democratic representatives to vote for the plan. President Biden, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have struggled to get their party to move in lockstep on progressive proposals. Tax breaks for oil and energy companies would also expire under the proposal, leading to $43.6 billion in revenue over the next ten years, but that is also unlikely to survive congressional adjustments to the budget. The president and state lawmakers are currently advocating increased oil production domestically to lower costs for consumers after sanctions on Russia increased oil prices worldwide. Another $33.2 billion is set aside for law enforcement, as Biden attempts to distance himself from progressives who want to “defund the police,” fulfilling his promise from his State of the Union speech on March 1. “We should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities[.]” For context, $33.2 billion would be equivalent to the 11th largest military budget in the world. The fiscal year 2023 will start in October of this year, giving Congress six months to negotiate the details. "

The former corporation, for example, said it would “no longer initiate new clinical trials in Russia” due to the military operation and the “brutal situation it has created.”However, some of those firms have noted they will not leave Russia entirely, with Pfizer adding that it remains committed to “providing needed medicines to the patients already enrolled in clinical trials.” Eli said much the same, continuing to deliver certain medicines in the country even as it suspends “all investments, promotional activities, and new clinical trials.”While New Delhi has come under Western pressure to sever its trade ties with Moscow, it has yet to budge on those demands, reportedly signing a deal to import Russian crude oil at a discounted price earlier this week despite a sweeping sanctions campaign led by the US and a long list of European allies. China has also faced similar calls to distance itself from Russia, but has refused to comply, denouncing the wave of sanctions as unhelpful and at odds with international law."

For this purpose, we have sent a request to open an office in Rostov-on-Don. This would be a good starting point to initiate the work,” Maurer said during talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow.The ICRC president also stated that the organization would continue working with its colleagues in Donetsk and Lugansk, and noted that more effort was needed in several key matters, such as humanitarian aid for Ukrainian and Donbass citizens. Maurer added that it is necessary to form teams in Ukraine to be sent to contested areas.Lavrov acknowledged the efforts of the Red Cross in helping people who suffered after the 2014 coup in Kiev, and said Russia is interested in sorting out humanitarian issues, including the evacuation of civilians and delivery of humanitarian aid, on a “specific and meaningful basis, without politicizing.”Maurer arrived in Moscow on Wednesday to continue the ICRC’s ongoing discussions on humanitarian issues with the Russian authorities. Last week, he visited Kiev to observe the current situation in the country, and met with Ukrainian officials last Thursday to call for greater humanitarian access and greater protection of civilians amid the hostilities.Moscow attacked the neighboring state in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

At the same time, answering a lawmaker's question regarding Tokyo's position on the issue of territories and the peace treaty, Kishida said it has not changed. Japan also sent a protest to Russia in connection with the Kremlin's decision, the Secretary General of the Japanese Cabinet of Ministers, said during a press conference. Earlier on Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that in response to what it characterized as unfriendly steps by Tokyo, Moscow would refuse to negotiate a peace treaty with Japan, halt visa-free travel for Japanese citizens to the southern Kuril Islands, and withdraw from dialogue with Japan on establishing joint economic activities in the southern Kurils. Japan claims the islands of Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan, and Habomai in the Kuril Island chain, based on a trade and border contract signed in 1855. Moscow claims indisputable sovereignty over the islands, which were annexed by the USSR following WWII. While post-World War II negotiations never resulted in a peace treaty, Japan and Russia agreed to expedite negotiations in 2018.  However, as Russia initiated its military operation in Ukraine on February 24, Japan joined the Western countries in implementing sanctions against Russia. The Kremlin announced that its special military operation was launched in response to requests for assistance from the republics of Donetsk and Lugansk against attacks by the Ukrainian military.

The fund has significant financial resources in the amount of at least $2.4 billion, according to the military.","Hunter Biden’s correspondence with Pentagon defense contractor Metabiota revealed how the son of then vice president leveraged his influence as a board member of Ukrainian gas firm Burisma to funnel money into pandemic-causing pathogen research just a few hundred miles from the Russian border. The emails were found on Hunter Biden’s laptop that he abandoned at a Delaware repair shop as his father was running for president in 2019, the New York Post said. The UK’s Daily Mail was first to report on his role in bankrolling pathogen research. A memo sent by a Metabiota official to the younger Biden just months after Crimea rejoined Russian in 2014 suggested that the Californian bioweapon research firm could assist Kiev in asserting ""Ukraine’s cultural and economic independence from Russia."" Hunter then introduced Metabiota to officials at Burisma who expressed interest in what he termed as a ""science project"" involving biolabs. He also reportedly bragged to investors that he helped Metabiota find new customers among government agencies. US government spending records show that Washington awarded $23.9 million to Metabiota later in 2014, including some $307,000 allocated for Ukrainian research projects, The New York Post said. What did they tell us? ...Visit laboratories? Of course. Stay in the reception area, there are wonderful people there who will meet you, get you some coffee and show you the catalogs. But you can’t go inside the laboratories, neither you nor specialized observers. What does that mean? It means unlawful experiments were going on there,"" the ministry's spokeswoman said on TV. Russian defense ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on Thursday that Russian experts had revealed new facts pointing to the direct involvement of the US Department of Defense in the development of biological weapons components in Ukraine. The Russian defense ministry continues to study documents received from employees of Ukrainian biolabs about the secret military biological activities of the United States in Ukraine. According to Konashenkov, the US had planned to test unregistered drugs on Ukrainian military personnel. "

On Tuesday, French sporting goods retailer Decathlon announced the suspension of its operations in Russia due to the situation in and around Ukraine. At the same time, Leroy Merlin and Auchan decided to continue their activities in Russia. On 24 February, Russia began a military operation in Ukraine responding to calls for help from the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The West responded by imposing comprehensive sanctions against Russia, prompting many foreign companies to suspend or downsize operations in the country. "

This step is aimed at stopping the non-diplomatic activities of a number of employees of Ukrainian foreign missions. They were asked to leave our country within 72 hours,” Glaz said.The Ukrainian embassy can “safely continue their work” in the format ‘1+4’, which means an ambassador and four diplomats. “Due to the actual lack of staff, the Belarusian side also decided to close the Ukrainian consulate in Brest,” Glaz announced.Speaking about the reasons behind these decisions, Glaz said that the “Ukrainian authorities began to directly and indirectly interfere in our internal affairs, put ‘on pause’ contacts between states, and, back in 2021, at a high official level, called Belarus a ‘hostile country’. These statements, unfortunately, were followed by a number of practical destructive actions,” Glaz said.Nevertheless, the foreign ministry spokesman said Ukrainians have remained “a close people” for Belarus.“Therefore, in connection with the current situation, the leadership of the country, as an exception, has decided to allow visa-free entry into the territory of the Republic of Belarus from Ukraine, stay and subsequent departure from the Republic of Belarus until April 15, 2022, including to Ukrainians and citizens of other foreign states trying to leave the war zone,” he said.On Tuesday, the State Security Committee – Belarus’ intelligence service – announced that it took measures “to fetter the intelligence activities” of Ukraine’s residency, which was allegedly operating under diplomatic cover.According to the deputy head of the KGB Investigation Department, Konstantin Bychek, the employees of both the embassy and of the Brest consulate were involved in intelligence activities.“With the total number of the diplomatic mission of Ukraine a little more than two dozen people, at least half of them were staff members of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine,” Bychek said. Responding to the spying accusations by Belarus, Ukraine said the employees of the Ukrainian embassy in Minsk officially represented “various departments of Ukraine,” including the Ministry of Defense and Security Service of Ukraine.“Their personal information was made public. Before the war, these people held hundreds of meetings with official representatives of Belarus. Such activities can hardly be called ‘undercover’,” Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said.Nikolenko also expressed hope that Minsk’s “provocation” has not been aimed at “strengthening anti-Ukrainian hysteria in Belarus, to justify support for Russia’s armed aggression against Ukraine.” He added that Kiev reserves the right to respond to such “unfriendly” actions.Responding to Wednesday’s news about the reduction of Ukraine’s diplomatic presence in Belarus, Nikolenko also said that Kiev would respond, with details to be revealed later."

No direct evidence was provided to back up the assertion. Of particular interest to Russian investigators are “documents testifying to the plans of the Kiev regime to use unmanned aerial vehicles capable of carrying and spraying deadly substances,” military spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov outlined during a briefing.Facts in the possession of the Russian military “prove that the Kiev regime was seriously considering the possibility of using biological weapons against the population of the Donbass and the Russian Federation,” Konashenkov added.Russia has also identified “specific officials who took part in the creation of components of biological weapons,” the general went on to reveal. He did not name any of them, however, saying only they were “the heads of divisions and employees of the US Department of Defense, as well as its main contractors.”These campaigns were “directly related to the son of the current US president, Hunter Biden,” Konashenkov added, citing investigations in the Western media. Last week, the Daily Mail published emails showing Biden’s ties to the Pentagon contractor Metabiota, which specialized in researching potential pandemic-causing pathogens that could be used as bioweapons.Biden’s involvement in the US funding of Ukrainian biolabs was brought up by Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, commander of the Russian Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Forces, in a briefing last Thursday.The results of the further analysis of documents and other evidence obtained from Ukrainian biolabs will be shared in more detail “in the near future at a special briefing,” Konashenkov promised.Washington has long claimed that allegations about Pentagon-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine were “Russian disinformation.” Earlier this month, however, US diplomat Victoria Nuland testified before the Senate that there were “biological research laboratories in Ukraine” and the US was working with Kiev “to ensure that the materials of biological research do not fall into the hands of Russian forces.” "

Yes, very. Sometimes they make scandalous demands, but we are moving forward step by step,” he said about the process with Russia, adding that talks are conducted almost every day. The Ukrainian president also spoke about the humanitarian efforts and evacuations his country was providing to cities caught up in Moscow's offensive.On Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the negotiations were progressing “a lot slower and are less substantial than we want them to be.” His remarks came in response to Zelensky, who previously suggested that key points concerning territorial integrity and recognition of the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk could be put to a referendum.Russia believes this strategy isn't acceptable. Moscow attacked the neighboring state in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.As retaliation for the military offensive, multiple Western countries have imposed unprecedented economic sanctions against Russian organizations and individuals."

Since the beginning of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Beijing has taken a neutral stance, urging all parties to stick to diplomacy, calling upon the West to address Russia’s longstanding security concerns and opposing unilateral anti-Russian sanctions.China’s stance has been interpreted by the West as pro-Russian, with the US-led NATO bloc openly urging Beijing to “to abstain from supporting Russia’s war effort in any way, and to refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions,” as well as accusing it of providing Moscow “with political support, including by spreading blatant lies and misinformation.”Beijing, however, has refused to bow to such demands, pointing to NATO’s continued expansion into Eastern Europe as a key factor behind the current conflict, as well as citing the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the 1999 Yugoslavia attack as one reason it won’t listen to a “lecture on justice from the abuser of international law.”Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and Russia’s recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk.

The spokesman said the Russian military is continuing its analysis of documents received from employees of Ukraine-based biological laboratories, including the secret military biological activities being conducted in the country by the US. The MoD spokesman did not elaborate on when the new information would be made public. The Russian military has spent the past month slowly pulling back the curtain on the extent of US-funded research into dangerous pathogens in Ukraine-based labs. Last week, the MoD cited documents which implicated an investment firm connected to Hunter Biden in the financing of the military biological programme in Ukraine. Western media initially rejected the Russian reports, with British newspaper, The Daily Mail, accusing the MoD of ""ramping up a wild propaganda campaign"" on bioweapons labs. However, analysis by the  newspaper based on emails garnered from the laptop which Biden Jr left behind in a Delaware computer repair shop soon confirmed that the president's son ""DID (sic) help secure millions in funding for [a] US contractor in Ukraine specialising in deadly pathogen research,"" and that the allegations made by Russia ""may well be true"". A report by the New York Post, the same newspaper that first broke the Biden laptop story in the autumn of 2020, corroborated the Daily Mail's reporting on Hunter and the Ukrainian biolabs. Pro-White House media has continued to defend the president amid mounting questions related to his family's activities in Ukraine, with the Washington Post releasing a ""fact check"" explainer suggesting that the labs alluded to were ""biological research facilities focused on better detecting, diagnosing and monitoring infectious-disease outbreaks,"" not ""bioweapons labs"". Furthermore, the Post suggested that ""random emails can be easily misinterpreted without additional reporting,"" and claimed, without evidence, that reports by its competitors were false.  Other outlets and media organisations, including the Daily Beast, NPR and Media Matters for America, have continued to dismiss the Russian MoD releases and western outlets' reporting as ""crazy"" ""conspiracy theories,"" notwithstanding Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland's remarks in a Senate hearing earlier this month confirming that ""biological research facilities"" were operating in Ukraine, and that the US was ""quite concerned"" that ""Russian troops...may be seeking to gain control of"" the facilities and the ""research materials"" contained therein. In a presentation on 6 March, the MoD published a letter by Ukrainian Health Minister Viktor Liashko dated 24 February (the same day the Russian military operation in Ukraine began) ordering the destruction of deadly pathogens scattered across Ukraine's network of biolabs.

And, on the other hand, more and more Poles don't understand why, if Italians confiscate the yachts of Russian oligarchs, we can't do the same in our country.”Morawiecki added that “there is some real estate, and financial assets, the shares in companies that we should seize.”The prime minister said he plans to work to have the new law passed in the Sejm, the lower house of the country's parliament.Morawiecki, who met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, has been calling for a total economic blockade of Russia and for Europe to completely relinquish energy supplies from Moscow. “I appeal to the German, the French and Benelux elites to put aside their calculators and start using their consciences. Because if we’re calculating the cost of gas and oil, it means we’re dealing in the blood of Ukrainian children, women and soldiers,” the prime minister said.Italian media reported this month that the authorities seized a superyacht owned by Russian coal and fertilizer tycoon Igor Melnichenko in the port of Trieste. Similar actions against luxury vessels owned by wealthy Russians were reported in France, Germany and Spain.Many countries, including the US, UK, EU member states, and Canada, have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia, hitting its banks and trade, among other sectors.The majority of European countries have closed their airspace to Russia-linked flights, to which Moscow has responded in kind. A long list of global companies and brands announced that they were limiting their operations in Russia or leaving the country’s market altogether.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."

US President Joe Biden had met with Brussels officials to try to push for an embargo on Russian oil too, which Europe had refrained from imposing, citing recession fears.The statement released by the US and the European Commission on energy security after the summit affirmed their “joint resolve to terminate EU dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2027,” and announced that a working group had been set up to achieve that end.The bloc said it had sought to ensure stable demand for additional US LNG of approximately 50 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year until at least 2030, “on the understanding that the price formula of LNG supplies to the EU should reflect long-term market fundamentals.”The European Union has decided to stop buying natural gas from Russia as part of a wide-ranging array of sanctions imposed in response to Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine. Russia currently meets about 40% of the EU’s demand, supplying about 175 billion cubic meters per year.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

A recent hiccup in the negotiations regarding Russia’s ability to continue its existing trade relationship with Iran despite the sanctions imposed in the wake of its attack on Ukraine has been resolved despite western concerns Moscow was deliberately holding up the deal.Borrell’s statement at Doha came shortly after a surprise appearance by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who echoed the US’s oft-repeated plea to oil-producing nations to increase production so that Russia cannot “blackmail” other countries by refusing to sell them fuel. However, thus far it has been Washington that has attempted to bar Moscow from selling its fuel, calling for a total ban of Russian oil and gas sales to the US. The country has continued to sell oil and gas to Europe, however, warning that should the continent attempt to join the US with an embargo of its own, they would only be hurting themselves.Former president Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal shortly after taking office and Washington showed little interest in reviving it until Russia’s recognition of the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk in the Donbas and subsequent offensive against Ukraine triggered the spike in oil and gas prices.While the US attempted to convince major oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia to increase their output to compensate for the cutoff of trade relations with Russia, its pleas have largely fallen on deaf ears, making the White House seek help from countries it once considered enemies, including Venezuela and - potentially - Iran. Saudi oil production and refining facilities have also come under heavy attack in recent weeks from the Houthis, who are still languishing under a blockade by the Saudi-led coalition that prevents critical food and medical supplies from reaching them.The JCPOA nuclear treaty put firm limits on the development of Iran’s nuclear program in return for lifting sanctions that have hamstrung the nation’s economy for years. While it was adopted in 2015, the sanctions were never completely rolled back, and bad blood has simmered among multiple parties as each accuses the other of failing to hold up their end of the bargain. The current iteration of the deal has been negotiated over the course of nearly 12 months. "

US officials and media initially denied that the labs existed, but a senior Biden administration official later confirmed their presence.","An investment firm connected to US President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden has been implicated in the financing of the Pentagon's military biological programme in Ukraine, the head of Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defence Troops has announced, citing fresh documents. According to the MoD's information, the fund has at least $2.4 billion in investment capital. ""At the same time, a close relationship has been established between the the fund and key contractors of the US military, including Metabiota, which alongside Black &amp; Veatch is one of the main suppliers of equipment for Pentagon biolaboratories around the world,"" Kirillov added. The Los Alamos National Laboratory - birthplace of the US atomic bomb, has served as one of the chief curators of the US military biological programmes in Ukraine, Kirillov said. ""The scale of the programme is impressive. Along with the Pentagon, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Soros' Open Society Foundations, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are directly involved in its implementation,"" the officer said. ""Scientific supervision is carried out by leading research organizations, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which developed nuclear weapons for the Manhattan Project. All of this activity has been carried out under the direct control of the Pentagon."" Kirillov accompanied his presentation with new Ukrainian-language documents detailing the operations of laboratories suspected of involvement in US-funded military biological activities, including a detailed listing of 31 laboratories across 14 settlements. The MoD also released a document from the office of the secretary of defense approving Project Concept UP-2, described as a 'multi-pathogen mapping' project which ""includes molecular fingerprinting of pathogens endemic to Ukraine and strain transfer.""  The 2008 document was signed by Richard Douglas, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense during the George W. Bush administration, and Arthur Hopkins, a deputy assistant to the Secretary of Defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programmes. Kirillov provided other new details on US military biological activities in Ukraine in his presentation, citing documents detailing the testing of unlicensed pharmaceutical products which did not pass licensing procedures in the US and Canada on Ukrainian military personnel under a programme known as 'Deep Drug'. ""Documents confirm an attempt to test previously untested drugs on Ukrainian military personnel [under the] Deep Drug screening system for pharmaceuticals which have not passed the licensing procedure in the United States and Canada. The special cynicism of the US sponsors of the programme lies in the fact that the developer -Skymount Medical Group, offered to purchase the system on a commercial basis, even though employees of the Ukrainian defence ministry were used as volunteers"" for its testing, Kirillov said. Kirillov also that over 4,000 individuals were involved in research under the previously detailed Project UP-8, and that according to a Bulgarian media investigation, 20 Ukrainian servicemen died and 200 hospitalized during experiments in the Kharkov laboratory alone. The officer suggested that such practices were nothing new, recalling that in 2010, authorities in Indonesia terminated biological research activity being conducted by the US Naval Medical Center in Jakarta over numerous violations and a refusal by US authorities to inform the Indonesian government about the results of their research. Kirillov also revealed that Pentagon-affiliated pharmaceutical firm Gilead has been involved in the testing of its products in Ukraine and Georgia. Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defence Troops have established that the US and its allies have exported about 16,000 biosamples from Ukraine as part of their military biological activities in the country. ""Such large-scale screening of the natural immunity of the population was likely carried out in order to select biological agents that are most dangerous for the population of a particular region,"" Kirillov said.  The officer pointed to the taking of blood samples from 4,000 servicemen in Lvov, Kharkov, Odessa and Kiev for antibodies to hantaviruses under Project UP-8, and an additional 400 samples probing for antibodies to the Crimean-Congo fever virus. He added that in addition to tissue and blood serum samples, dangerous pathogens and their carriers were exported abroad from Ukraine. Over 10,000 samples were sent to the Lugar Center in Georgia alone, according to Kirillov, with labs in the UK and the Leffler Institute in Germany also serving as recipients, subjecting not only Ukraine but the entire region to dangers. Kirillov warned that the spread of pathogenic biomaterials in Ukraine could lead to a new pandemic, saying that in the Russian military's view, ""the current situation involving the spread of pathogenic biomaterials from Ukraine to European countries can cause death and create a hotbed of epidemiological instability the scale of which would be comparable to the COVID-19 pandemic."" The officer pointed to the Pentagon's record of causing health scares involving deadly pathogens, recalling that betwen 2005 and 2015, live anthrax spores were accidentally sent from the US Army Dugway Proving Ground to 194 addressees in ten different countries. Krillov also pointed to suspected US interest in the means of transmitting anthrax through insects. ""The interest of US military biologists in the study of insect vectors in the locations of cattle burial grounds appears not have been accidental, with researchers analyzing the results of an outbreak of anthrax in Yamal in 2016, during which cases of transmission of the disease through flies and horseflies were recorded,"" he said. The officer echoed concerns voiced by China's foreign ministry earlier this month about the real purpose of the 336 labs scattered across 30 countries being operated with US funding and other forms of support, and suggested that in light of the new information which has been disclosed, an international investigation is in order. Thursday's revelations by the MoD follow a separate document dump last week containing frightening details on some of the research feared engaged in at US-funded laboratories scattered across Ukraine, such as work studying the transmission of diseases through bats, 'Project Flu-Fly-Way', studying how wild migratory birds might be used as vectors to transmit avian influenza, and others. The Russian military started disclosing details on the scale and scope of the US-funded network of biolabs in Ukraine on 6 March, reporting, citing documents, that the Ukrainian health ministry had given the order to scrub incriminating evidence on research into deadly pathogens including anthrax, the plague, tularemia, cholera and other deadly diseases. US officials and media dismissed the Russian allegations, releasing ""fact check"" pieces explaining that the ""false claim of US biolabs in Ukraine [is] tied to [a] Russian disinformation campaign."" These same officials and outlets were forced to change their tune after US undersecretary of state Victoria Nuland confirmed that the biolabs existed, and that the US  was ""quite concerned"" that Russian troops might take control of the facilities.

According to the newspaper, Turkish ships were asked to monitor possible drifting mines and promptly report to the main coordination centre of rescue operations should such a mine be detected. On 24 February, Russia began a special operation to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine, responding to calls for help from the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics in countering the aggression of Ukrainian troops. The Russian Defence Ministry said the special operation is targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure only and the civilian population is not in danger. "

Some outlets suggested that the yellow suits with blue stripes on them indicated the cosmonauts' support for Kiev amid Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine.,"Roscosmos has explained the meaning behind Russian cosmonauts' yellow and blue suits. In contrast to what some Western media outlets viewed as a political expression, the colours refer to symbols of the university that all three men graduated from - Bauman Moscow State Technical University. On his Twitter account, Rogozin recommended refraining from looking for other meanings in the space suits.  One of the cosmonauts, Oleg Artemyev, echoed the sentiment, noting that sometimes a colour is just a colour and not necessarily a reference to some country's national flag. The colour pallette of the Russian space suits drew a lot of attention in the Western media on Saturday, with many outlets - among them The Times, The Guardian, CBS News, and others - suggesting that it was an indication of the cosmonauts' political position regarding the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. However, according to Roscosmos' press service chief Dmitry Strugovets, the design of a space uniform is agreed on long before a flight takes place, and it had nothing to do with Ukraine's national symbols.  Instead, the colours refer to the symbols of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. Oleg Artemyev, along with fellow cosmonauts Sergei Korsakov and Denis Matveev, graduated from this university. Moreover, Artemyev, according to Roscosmos' press service, has already travelled to space wearing the colours of his alma mater. The three Russian cosmonauts arrived at the ISS on 18 March on board the Soyuz MC-21 spacecraft. "

The fake news, they’re trying to say he’s acting brilliantly,” he said. But, according to Trump, this isn’t the case at all, because currently “Ukraine is being bombed to s**t!”“Joe Biden should recuse himself from anything having to do with Ukraine because of how much money they're getting from Ukraine. They’ve taken in a fortune,” he said, referring to what he believes is alleged corrupt activity between the president’s son, Hunter Biden, and a Ukrainian gas company.The younger Biden had joined the board of Burisma Holdings – one of Ukraine’s largest private natural gas producers – in 2014, soon after the Maidan protests in Kiev that ultimately installed a pro-Western government in the country. The violent coup was backed by the administration of former President Barack Obama, in which Biden senior held the position of vice president.During the 2020 election campaign, Trump claimed that Biden had used his influence and his government position to get his son the job, with a reported salary of $83,000 per month, and later pressured then-President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko to fire a prosecutor, who had been investigating alleged violations at Burisma.The elder Biden confirmed that he threatened to withhold a loan to Kiev in order to get a prosecutor sacked, but insisted that this was done to get rid of a corrupt official, in line with bipartisan US policy. His campaign denied all other claims.Trump’s own attempts to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch a new, publicly announced probe into the Biden family’s dealings with Burisma resulted in ‘abuse of power’ and ‘obstruction of Congress’ charges against him, which eventually led to an impeachment.“Ukraine would've never happened"" if he was still the US president, Trump assured his crowd.He mentioned Biden numerous times during the speech, saying that the Democrat’s stay in the White House has been “one train wreck after another.”  “The five worst presidents in American history” together “would not have done the damage Joe Biden has done in just 15 months,” the 75-year-old insisted. “In just over a year, he has managed to kill, literally kill, the American dream.”“But do not lose hope, because, with the right leadership, America will be back, greater, stronger, and more powerful than ever before,” Trump promised, stopping short of announcing another run for office in 2024.Unlike Biden, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin was “smart” for using the military build-up near the Ukrainian border to put pressure on Washington during the negotiations for security guarantees, he said. However, he decried the Russian attack on its neighbor as a “big mistake.”“That’s a hell of a way to negotiate, put 200,000 troops on the border. That was a big mistake, but it looked like a great negotiation. That didn’t work out too well for him,” the 45th US president said.Trump also warned about the threat of a nuclear conflict as a result of tensions between Russia and the West over Moscow’s operation.Russia put its nuclear weapons on high alert after launching its military operation in the neighboring country in late February, citing what it described as “aggressive statements” made by NATO, and harsh financial sanctions imposed by the West.“We have the president of Russia mentioned the N-word... the nuclear word,” Trump said.“The nuclear word is a very dangerous, dangerous word and it’s being thrown around very cavalierly.”Russia sent its troops into Ukraine a month ago, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."

The move from the economist and long-time official was confirmed by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday.According to a Bloomberg report citing two ""sources familiar with the situation,"" the decision was made due to his opposition to Russia’s military attack on Ukraine.The Kremlin commented on the reports by expressing sympathy for Chubais and pledging Moscow's help, should he need it.“I am not aware of any requests for assistance,” Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, told the media. “The news is definitely sad and we wish him a swift recovery.”Chubais is best known for his role under Yeltsin, whom he helped usher in radical US-advised post-Soviet market reforms in the early 1990s.

The measure effects countries which have imposed sanctions on Russia in connection with Ukraine and froze Moscow’s foreign reserves.The ‘unfriendly’ states Putin referred to are the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Switzerland, the 27 nations of the European Union, and a number of smaller countries.Moreover, according to Ilyin, it may be necessary to reduce Russia’s reserves in the currencies of unfriendly countries, including the US dollar and euro, given the risk of sanctions-related freezing of payments.Therefore, Russia itself should accumulate ruble reserves.“With stable exports and budget revenues, an excess of rubles will be formed, which will be directed to state support or temporarily placed in banks,” the expert suggested.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

The men donned bright-yellow flight suits with blue patches, prompting Western speculation that their outfit selection was somehow related to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.Multiple media outlets, including The Independent, The Guardian and others, rolled out articles about the cosmonauts’ suits, suggesting the fresh team were “wearing colors of Ukraine flag.”“It was unclear what, if any, message the yellow uniforms they changed into were intended to send,” the article in The Guardian reads.The bizarre attention the media has directed towards the outfits worn by the new cosmonaut team has been ridiculed by Russian space boss Dmitry Rogozin, who blasted speculation about the colors as just part of the “information war” against Russia.“Some Bandera rejects and their Anglo-Saxon sponsors no longer know what to come up with in their information war against Russia,” Rogozin said in a Telegram post. “I want to disappoint you. Our cosmonauts would rather see the Ukrainian Nazis in their coffins.”The flight suits’ colors were a nod to the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, from which all the cosmonauts of the new team had graduated, Rogozin explained. The university’s emblem has dominant yellow and blue colors, while the Soyuz-2 launch complex itself has a similar color palette, he went on, sharing the emblem of the university to reinforce his point.One of the cosmonauts, Oleg Artemyev, elaborated further on the suits affair, confirming that the colors opted-for had nothing to do with the Ukrainian crisis. The suits are made specifically for each crewmember some six months before the launch, he said, so it simply could not be linked to the Russian offensive launched late in February.“In past flights, I had flight suits in yellow, white, and blue. There is no need to look for secret signs and symbols in our uniforms. Color is just color. It has nothing to do with Ukraine,” Artemyev stated. “These days, despite the fact that we are in space, we stand together with our president and our people!”"

The situation could lead to hunger and food rioting in poor countries, where food security depends on imports, the head of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told the Guardian on Thursday.“I think we should be very worried. The impact on food prices and hunger this year and next could be substantial. Food and energy are the two biggest items in the consumption baskets of poor people all over the world,” Okonjo-Iweala said, adding that “it is poor countries and poor people within poor countries that will suffer the most.”Okonjo-Iweala specified that Russia and Ukraine provide 24% of global supplies of wheat, noting that food imports from the Black Sea region were crucial for survival for 35 African countries.The WTO official urged food-producing countries not to make the same mistakes that were made with vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, when rich nations hoarded supplies, leaving poorer countries waiting to get doses.“It is a natural reaction to keep what you have – we saw that with vaccines. But we shouldn’t make the same mistake with food… We must make sure we learn the lessons from vaccines and previous food crises. I am not sure we can fully mitigate the impact of the war in Ukraine because the numbers involved are huge, but we can mitigate some of it,” she noted.Okonjo-Iweala expressed concern that Ukraine would not be able to kick off this year’s planting season on time due to the conflict. This is problematic, she noted, as Ukraine normally supplies half the wheat to the World Food Programme, the UN department that provides emergency supplies to countries.“If we don’t think about how to mitigate the impact of the war that will be another catastrophe not just this year but next year,” she stressed, noting that food riots comparable to those in the late 2000s could start if prices grow further. In order to avoid escalation, she said the WTO is urging its 164 members not to impose export restrictions on food.In a push to isolate Russia over its military operation in Ukraine, a number of WTO members, including the US, the UK, EU and Canada have imposed tariffs on Russia, slashing its most-favored trade partner status and calling on the trade body to kick Russia out altogether. However, according to Okonjo-Iweala, this is unlikely to happen, because the process would be too complicated and require 75% of members to approve.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

The talks between Moscow and Kiev delegations are ongoing amid the military conflict in Ukraine.“Nothing has changed in this regard. We’ve stated before that a meeting at the highest level must be preceded by the finalization of work on the agreements, the endorsement and initialing of these texts by the top officials,” Peskov told journalists. “I wouldn’t define any clear timeframe.”Earlier this week, Turkey, which refused to slap sanctions on Russia over its military operation in Ukraine, hosted negotiations between Moscow and Kiev delegations. After the talks, Russian top negotiator Vladimir Medinsky announced that Ukraine had presented written proposals concerning a possible agreement between the two nations, which included commitments to forego NATO membership and nuclear weapons.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that he considered the results of the negotiations “significant progress,” as the Ukrainian side “confirmed the need to ensure a non-nuclear, non-aligned status of Ukraine and its security outside the framework of NATO, as well as the Ukrainian colleagues’ understanding that the issues of Crimea and the Donbass have been permanently resolved.”Crimea voted to rejoin Russia in 2014, after a coup in Kiev. Kiev claims the vote was illegitimate and refers to Crimea as temporarily occupied Ukrainian territory. Regarding the Donbass republics, Moscow recognized them as independent states back in February.Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko, for his part, disagreed with Lavrov’s interpretation of the results of the negotiations, claiming that the Russian FM “demonstrates a misunderstanding” of the negotiating process and that “the issues of Crimea and Donbas will be settled for good after Ukraine restores its sovereignty over them.”Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

Back then, the country was faced with the initial waves of US and EU sanctions in response to Crimea’s decision to rejoin Russia. “The people who impose sanctions don't understand the Russian character. The greater the pressure from the outside, the more united we are and willing to do as we see fit,” Shuvalov, who used to be Russia’s First Deputy Prime Minister from 2008 to 2018, insisted. “We will ourselves figure out what to do at home. We don't need to be lectured and helped by those who seize what we rightfully own,” he added.Driving the Russians into a corner by imposing economic sanctions “won't do any good” to those pursuing this path, the official warned. Dialogue is the only way to deal with Moscow, he added.“No one has ever defeated us. People just don't remember the history of the 20th century. They probably have a feeling that they will succeed in the 21st century, but I don't believe it,” he said. According to Shuvalov, Russia has been going through “a hundred years of difficult transition” that included “suffering, terrible wars, famine” and other hardships, but it's going to be concluded soon, with the country coming out of it with a strong economy.Sanction pressure on Russia was ramped up after Moscow sent its troops to Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the breakaway Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

Tod Wolters, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and NATO’s second-highest-ranking general, said the alliance will likely need to increase its deployments in Eastern Europe, which the alliance commonly calls its “Eastern Flank.” ""Obviously, there's always a mix between the requirement of permanent versus rotational, and there are pluses and minuses of each one,"" he added. ""We'll have to continue to examine the European contributions to make a smart decision about where to go in the future."" The US has rushed thousands of troops to Europe since late February, when Russia launched a special operation in Ukraine aimed at neutralizing the country’s military and rendering it unable to become a forward position from which NATO could attack Russia. While the alliance has declined to defend Ukraine, which is not yet a member, it has vowed to defend the territory of its members, several of which border Ukraine. That total comes as NATO doubled its Enhanced Forward Presence deployment to Eastern Europe last week, sending four new battle groups to Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. The other four battle groups were already deployed in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia; together the eight battalion-sized units consist of roughly 10,000 troops. NATO’s eastward expansion has been a major foreign policy concern of the Russian Federation since the end of the Cold War. The alliance was formed in 1949 by several Western European capitalist states who banded together to jointly resist either a Soviet invasion or a socialist revolution in one of their own countries. Although it claimed to be an alliance in defense of democracies, from the beginning that claim was made farcical by the inclusion of Portugal, which was ruled by the Estado Novo dictatorship of Antonio Salazar. NATO again expanded eastward in the 2000s, when Romania, Bulgaria, several former Yugoslav republics, and the Baltic States joined; the latter were considered particularly provocative, as they had previously been part of the USSR itself. Ukraine and Georgia, two other former Soviet Republics, have also grown increasingly close to NATO and after the 2014 US-backed coup in Kiev, the new Ukrainian government made the goal of joining NATO a priority and even added it to the Ukrainian Constitution in 2019. In recent negotiations to end the Russian operation, Kiev has signaled it is willing to give up its NATO membership ambitions and become a politically neutral state. "

Remarkably, she was mirroring the words which had been said by Ukrainian ambassador to Denmark Mykhailo Vydoinyk, who suggested that Ukrainian refugees should not be integrated into Denmark, but return to their home country and help build it up when the time is right. The Danish Foreign Minister, Frederiksen's party mate Mattias Tesfaye said that the government expected that “significantly more” Ukrainians could arrive than the 20,000 for whom the municipalities had prepared originally. Through the special law, the Ukrainian refugees have been allowed to stay in Denmark for two years, where they'd be granted work permits as well as access to education and health services. The law was adopted urgently and in record time through a cross-party consensus. The Danish approach has sparked criticism from, among others, Human Rights Watch, which accused the Nordic country of double standards in treating refugees from different countries. According to the organisation, in the past years, Denmark has been “at the forefront among European countries to enact pernicious laws and policies designed to deter people from seeking asylum”, to the point of declaring a zero-asylum policy. The organisation also noted the so-called “jewellery law”, which allowed the government to seize asylum seekers’ assets, including their jewellery, to fund their stay in the country. Remarkably, Ukrainians were exempted from this law. Russia's military operation to in Ukraine was launched on 24 February, in response to calls for help from the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk amid shelling by Ukrainian forces. According to the UN, over three million Ukrainians have since left the country. "

""But now that Russia has entered into a conflict with Ukraine, everyone is talking about it – the media, celebrities, American citizens.A post shared by Jeff Monson (@jeff_monson_official)""[The media in the west] do not provide any alternative point of view. They speak in unison about how Russia occupied Ukraine.""This is propaganda. They don't tell you what's really going on. They will never say that Russia only wanted to protect its borders and achieve recognition by Ukraine of the independence of the [Luhansk People's Republic] and [Donetsk People's Republic. It is not true that Russia wants to take over Ukraine.""The US has repeatedly violated resolutions and human rights and carried out war crimes throughout history, according to Monson, who cited his birth country's military and financial interventions in Afghanistan, Israel and Palestine, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen and asked why Russia is portrayed as a ""villain"" on the international stage.The 51-year-old suggested that media organizations are more likely to support and avoid frankness about their own country but described reporting in the west as ""completely false"".""When I watch RT, I don't feel like I'm being lied to,"" he added. ""With Western media, this feeling never leaves me.A post shared by Jeff Monson (@jeff_monson_official)""Russia is a great country. People here are ready to help, share, take care, which surprises me every time.""In the US, people care more about how much money you have, what car, what house. Russians care much less about such material things. Because of this, I am happy here.""Biden is just a figure, an image. He has been in government for 47 years and has done nothing during this time.""He supported [racial] segregation [in 1977, when Biden said integration via mandatory busing would create a 'racial jungle.']""He said it publicly – there is a video. And now he has a black vice president. I don't know what he really believes. He constantly changes his mind.""He supports what is popular at the moment. Earlier, he said that the US should be protected by a wall from all wars. But right now, the US is bombing six different countries. Simply breathtaking.""Biden does not run the country. It is run by corporations. He just does what he is told.""I don't believe in all this pseudo-democracy. It doesn't matter if he's healthy or not. Of course, it's funny when he forgets words and makes mistakes. But he doesn't make decisions.""The US carries out dishonest elections, will bomb countries under any President and had no evidence behind blaming Russian hackers for rigging the 2017 presidential election in which Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, said Monson.He said the wide range of sanctions imposed on Russia were purely designed to ""terrify Russian citizens.""""They did not care about the starving children of Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, who were also sanctioned,"" he said.""They were not provided with any humanitarian assistance. But now they have decided to take care of the Ukrainians. Funny.""In fact, the US does not care about Ukrainian citizens. They impose sanctions on anyone they don't like.""And who imposed sanctions on the United States for the bombing of other countries? Who banned American Paralympic athletes, figure skaters and so on from participating in competitions?""No consequences. Because the US is a superpower backed by the dollar. Nobody says anything against them, no matter what they do.""The USA is a country of hypocrisy. It is based on two things: the genocide of the Native Americans, the Indians who lived there for thousands of years – they took away their lands, resources.""And then there were black slaves who were exploited, bought and sold. That is, the US is based on genocide and slavery.""And now they are teaching the whole world to live. In fact, they colonize other countries, taking their resources. The US uses people in the same Philippines, Indonesia and many other countries.""With Europe, the same thing: Great Britain, Portugal, Spain, at the expense of the colonies, accumulated initial capital. The West is pumping trillions of dollars out of poor countries.""I adhere to extreme left views, a completely different ideology [to Putin]. But I believe that he loves Russia and that he is doing everything to make Russia better, based on his vision.""On some points I agree with him but on others I don't. I also want the best for Russia: I want people to be happy, the borders to be safe and there to be normal relations with other countries. In this, we are similar.""Monson fought for the UFC in 2000, 2002 and 2006 and lost to Emelianenko's brother, Alexander, in a fist-fighting tournament in February.The powerhouse said that his experiences in Ukraine gave him a keen understanding of its history and what was happening there, claiming that Ukrainians welcomed the Nazis during the Second World War, who he said swiftly turned on them to deadly effect.""And now it is denied,"" he rued. ""The USA and Europe support fascism in Ukraine.""You just need to understand the reasons why monuments are being destroyed. Not because they want a better future for Ukraine, equality. The Nazis want to rewrite history.""Monson added on Instagram: ""We support Ukraine but we do not support the people of Donbass that Ukraine has been bombing for the past eight years without stopping. It is popular right now to support Ukraine.""We don’t know anything about Ukraine’s genocide against the civilians in Donbass because the media never mentions it. We support only Ukraine because that’s what we are told to do.""The world only started paying attention to this conflict only two weeks ago because of western media admonishing Russia."""

Japan lays claim to the Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan, and Habomai islands in Russia’s Kuril Island chain, known in Russia as the Southern Kurils, citing an 1855 bilateral treaty on trade and borders. Moscow insists that its sovereignty over the islands, which became part of the USSR after WWII, is undisputed.     The negotiations held after WWII never resulted in a peace treaty. In 2018, Japan and Russia agreed to speed up negotiations.     However, Japan joined Western countries in imposing sanctions against Russia as Moscow began a military operation in Ukraine on 24 February. The decision to start the operation was made in response to calls for help from the republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. "

Neither nation is a member of the body, which acts as the legislature of the European Union (EU).“As of today, diplomatic and government staff of Russia and Belarus are banned from entering the premises of the [European Parliament],” its president Roberta Metsola announced on Twitter.“There is no place in the House of Democracy for those who seek to destroy the democratic order,” she added, concluding with the hashtag “Stand With Ukraine️.”Metsola, a Maltese politician, was elected to the post in January. The EP has 705 members from the 27 countries of the EU. Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine are not members, though Kiev has requested to join by a fast-track process since the start of hostilities with Moscow last month.The symbolic ban presumably applies to the EP’s premises in both Brussels and Strasbourg, which it shares with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), another transnational body. Russia officially withdrew from PACE on Tuesday, accusing it of being a “convenient platform for NATO’s information and political campaigns.” “Everything turned to ash and dust in the Council of Europe long ago. This organization has become just an instrument for NATO propaganda,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Sputnik radio on Tuesday.PACE reacted to Moscow’s announcement by voting to expel Russia and issuing a statement lamenting how this would “deprive the Russian people of the benefit of the most advanced human rights protection system in the world, including the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.”Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

Peter Szijjarto also warned that no-fly zone proposals for Ukraine risk sparking a larger regional conflict. Speaking to reporters following a meeting with fellow European Union members in Brussels on Monday, the Hungarian foreign minister said Budapest is unlikely to back penalties targeting Russian gas and oil, as they are liable to harm its own interests.“An agreement on possible EU sanctions against Russian energy supplies or their interruption will most likely not be reached,” he said, adding that “We will not support any sanctions that could pose a risk to energy supplies to Hungary.”Some countries are dependent on Russian energy supplies. We don't do this for fun. Energy supply is not a philosophical or ideological question, but a physical, mathematical one.The FM’s comments follow reports that the EU would meet to consider an all-out embargo on Russian energy, though the body was “split” on the issue after Monday’s summit, according to Reuters.While Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney argued that it’s “very hard to make the case that we shouldn't be moving in on [Russia’s] energy sector” given “the extent of the destruction in Ukraine,” he faced pushback from not only Hungary, but Germany and the Netherlands as well.“The question of an oil embargo is not a question of whether we want or don't want [it], but a question of how much we depend on oil,” Berlin’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, told reporters, noting that some EU states cannot simply “stop the oil imports from one day to the other.”Szijjarto also voiced concerns over other plans floated by EU and NATO members in recent weeks, including calls for a no-fly zone over Ukraine and an armed ‘peacekeeping’ mission to end fighting there, saying those issues must be discussed “clearly” as there is a “new war risk.”“We must avoid that. Hungary’s interest is clear: Hungary wants to stay out of this war, we will stick to NATO’s common position and reject proposals that risk either an air war or an extended war on the ground,” he added.The FM stated that while Hungary would not attempt to block other EU members from shipping additional weapons to Ukrainian forces, it also would not take part in such transfers itself, nor allow arms to cross its territory. Though the Hungarian government has condemned Moscow’s attack on Ukraine and agreed to some sanctions, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that his country must “stay out” of the conflict and has repeatedly refused to support weapons shipments. Moscow attacked the neighboring state in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO.

It was described as an “old type,” which had been used by the Soviet military during World War II.The discovery led to a brief halt in traffic along the Bosphorus, a key transport artery connecting the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Turkish authorities have also banned night-time fishing in the Black Sea.Media reports at the weekend claimed that a second mine had been found and destroyed in the area.Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) had earlier warned that a number of antique naval mines, which it says were planted by Ukraine along the Black Sea coast in the wake of the Russian military operation in the country, have detached from their anchors due to stormy weather and drifted away.Kiev has disputed those claims, describing them as Russian disinformation serving as a pretext to close off parts of the sea.Russia sent its troops into Ukraine over a month ago, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

However, output has fallen steeply, with New Zealand and Australia posting declines of over 6%.Anhydrous milk fat hit a record price of $7,111 per ton on March 15, while whole milk powder surged to an eight-year high this month.“The conflict in Ukraine has added to an already complex Covid-19 operating environment, impacting global supply chains, the oil price, and the global supply of grains,” Miles Hurrell, chief executive at New Zealand multinational dairy co-operative Fonterra told the FT.Russia, Ukraine, and China are leading exporters of both nitrogen-based fertilizers and wheat – a vital feed for cattle along with corn and soy. The issues in gas supply, worsened by the offensive in Ukraine, together with the pandemic restrictions imposed in China after another Covid outbreak, have made both difficult to acquire.The combination of all those factors makes production “bloody expensive,” said Craig Hough, director of policy and strategy at Australian Dairy Farmers.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

It adopted in response to a sweeping crackdown by Western social media platforms – such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube – on Russian news entities and even content deemed sympathetic to the Russian side of the current conflict in Ukraine.While announcing, along with most other major tech platforms, that it was “shocked” and “saddened” by Moscow's military attack on Ukraine, Spotify continued to operate in Russia for weeks even after shuttering its local office “indefinitely” and banning all content from state-funded new outlets RT and Sputnik from its platform.The platform even got into the fact-checking game – partnering with the likes of the New York Times, the BBC, the Wall Street Journal, and the Guardian, as well as podcast “explainers” – to deliver ‘approved’ content about the conflict.Many of these media outlets could have run afoul of the “fake news” law, given they have shared false stories and rumors, in the past.Spotify has only been operational in Russia and Ukraine since 2020. Like other foreign social media companies with a certain number of users, it was required under a law passed last July to open a local office in March 2022 or be subject to restrictions and potential bans. However, in common with many other Western social media platforms, it has opted to shut down its operations in the country entirely. "

Ukrainian forces are trained in the use of these systems, which they have operated for decades.At least some of the supplies will be withdrawn from the Redstone Arsenal in Alabama, officials told the newspaper, adding that C-17 Globemaster cargo planes recently flew to a nearby airfield in Huntsville.Washington “is hoping that the provision of additional air defenses will enable Ukraine to create a de facto no-fly zone,” the newspaper said. NATO members have repeatedly rebuffed Kiev’s call to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine, stating that it would draw them directly into the hostilities and could lead to a world war.The list of equipment slated for delivery does not include the S-300 long-range missiles, the report said. The US reportedly purchased at least one such battery from Belarus in the 1990s in a clandestine operation. But Washington plans to supply shorter-range 9K33 Osa systems, according to WSJ sources.Last Wednesday, CNN’s Jim Sciutto reported that the US and NATO allies were going to send to Ukraine an array of Soviet air defense systems with capabilities better than the shoulder-launched Stinger missiles delivered in the hundreds in the weeks before the Russian attack.New: US & NATO allies are sending several surface-to-air missiles systems to Ukraine. A senior US official tells me these systems include Soviet-era SA-8, SA-10, SA-12 and SA-14 mobile air defense systems, w/range higher than Stingers, giving capability to hit cruise missiles.He was referring to a potential deal with Slovakia, which later confirmed it was willing to share its own S-300 systems with Ukraine. Slovakia’s defense minister, Jaroslav Nad, told a news conference on Thursday that he discussed the plan with his visiting US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, and that his country wanted to receive “a proper replacement” first.The Russian military reported destroying multiple Ukrainian S-300 batteries over the nearly month-long attack. One of the stated goals of the Russian incursion is to demilitarize Ukraine and ensure that it will not pose any threat to the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk, which Moscow recognized as independent states prior to the attack.Moscow has warned that it will consider convoys delivering arms to Ukraine as legitimate targets for its armed forces. The WSJ didn’t explain the proposed logistics of the delivery of the US-owned anti-aircraft systems."

It was later confirmed that the 23-year-old, who is the son of F1 icon Michael, was uninjured but this Haas team pulled him from the race as a precaution.However, Schumacher's high velocity accident reignited criticisms from some drivers, including Hamilton's Mercedes teammate George Russell, that the track was designed with entertainment in mind more-so than driver safety, with Russell referring to it as a ""recipe for disaster.""Hamilton, though, said that now that both his and Formula 1's obligations in Saudi Arabia had been fulfilled, he was looking forward to putting the event in his rear-view mirror. “I am so happy the weekend is done,” he said after the race, which was won by Hamilton's title rival Max Verstappen. “I am so happy that everyone is safe, I am just looking forward to getting out. I just want to go home.”Hamilton's stance was echoed by Verstappen: “We had a lot of guarantees that of course it would be safe but after this weekend all the drivers together, we will speak with F1 and the team bosses to see what is happening for the future.”McClaren's Lando Norris was another who was eager to leave.“Of course, I am relieved [it is over],” he said. “It is a nervous place to be and you are going to have these nerves.”F1 chiefs have been placed in somewhat of a predicament by their drivers after only recently signing a 10-year, $900 million deal to hold annual races in Saudi Arabia.The controversial race took place in direct contrast to the proposed Russian Grand Prix in Sochi which was scheduled for later this year but was canceled in the wake of Russia's military operation in Ukraine."

The issue centers on a headline about Gen Z.The American magazine said it “terminated its publishing partnership in Russia” and urged readers to learn how they can “support the people of Ukraine right now,” in a statement on Instagram. The statement was released due to “recent social media activity.”The magazine was apparently responding to negative reactions to the cover of the March issue of Elle Russia. It features a photo of Deva Cassel and several headlines, including one that reads: ‘Life rules for Gen Z: conscience, environmentalism, honesty, post-irony’.

The movie revolves around the 2014 Ukrainian coup, the war in Donbass, the Crimean referendum, and other events.","Internet enterpreneur Kim Dotcom has taken to Twitter to recommend all those tweeting about Ukraine to first watch the documentary ""Ukraine on Fire"" that covers the tumultuous events that occurred in Ukraine in 2014, such as the Maidan revolution and the Donbass war. He posted a Rumble link to the movie, featuring Oliver Stone interviewing figures like Russian President Vladimir Putin and ex-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich about the 2014 revolution in the Eastern European country. In separate tweets, Dotcom appeared to have shown what some of his followers deemed veiled support of Moscow in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. In one particular tweet, the blogger rolled out his own statement regarding the crisis. Dotcom additionally slammed the calls by Washington to charge Russia with war crimes at the International Criminal Court (ICC) - ""the same Court the US Govt legislated against to stop its war crimes from being prosecuted"", as he put it. Released in 2016, ""Ukraine on Fire"" was labelled on YouTube (although it remains accessible) after the platform deemed that it breached its policy on violent content, so the film was uploaded on Rumble for free. Featuring director Oliver Stone, the movie details the development of Ukrainian nationalism. The movie takes a particular look into the events of 2014, when Kiev was rattled by the violent Maidan coup - the event that triggered Crimea's reunification with Russia, the war in Donbass, and contributed to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Since 24 February, Moscow has been carrying out a special military operation that was launched by the Kremlin to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine. Moscow said it has no plans to occupy Ukraine, underlining that Russian troops are exclusively targeting military infrastructure there and pose no threat to civilians. The West has condemned the Russian operation, imposing a slew of sanctions targeting Russia's economy, media, culture, businesses, and politicians. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU's plan ""to break free from Russian fossil fuels,"" will be unveiled together with US President Joe Biden on Friday. Although the US can export more and Australia, which is sending a lot of gas to China, could ship more to Europe right now, it will likely not be sufficient, Sitton added. Center for LNG and the Natural Gas Supply Association spokesperson Daphne Magnuson told Sputnik on Thursday that the United States is increasing its capacity to export more LNG to the EU after the Energy Department recently approved several pending permits with more approvals coming.  Magnuson also underscored that the US is well-positioned to continue to provide the European Union with liquefied natural gas at the time being. Last week, the US authorized LNG exports from two current operating export facilities in the states of Louisiana and Texas. Earlier in March, Biden announced a US-only ban on Russian oil imports although the United States imports much less oil from Russia than European states, which have been leery of imposing similar restrictions. Before Biden departed for Europe this week, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told Sky News the US would not ask Europe to fully abandon Russian energy supplies. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed Gazprom to change existing gas contracts into rubles in response to the EU, US, and Japan blocking Russia from accessing euros, dollars and yen. The announcement caused the Russian currency to climb against the dollar while global gas prices jumped. Meanwhile, International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol described Putin’s order as a ""security threat."" However, Sitton said Moscow's demand for European countries to purchase Russian gas in rubles should not have a massive impact on energy prices. Sitton predicts the price of Russian crude oil might actually go down a little bit while they slightly increase elsewhere. Natural gas prices were surging on the European market late last year, spurred by growing energy demand amid an economic recovery after months of lockdowns, as well as a limited supply. This has prompted the EU authorities to reinforce efforts toward ensuring the bloc's energy security, the need for which has become even more pressing during the conflict with Russia, the EU's main energy supplier, over the latter's special military operation in Ukraine.

However, another, regular, procedure on the issue is still in play. This means that the decision doesn't amount to an outright refusal to lift sanctions imposed by Brussels, but rather prevents an interim lifting of restrictions before a final decision. “The President of the Court considers in this respect that the information provided does not allow us to assess whether the damage invoked has a social dimension,” the court said in statement.The French version of the RT TV channel was banned from broadcasting in the European Union in early March, following the launch of Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine. The outlet protested the decision, saying that the censorship would lead to “dramatic” economic, financial, and human consequences. It also asked that its request to lift the ban be urgently assessed.The court ruled that RT France had refrained from “explaining its financial situation” and had not provided “specific figures” to support its claims about the “the serious and irreparable nature of its financial loss.”Regarding reputational damage that resulted from the EU Council’s decision, the court refuted this, arguing that the channel had been labeled as “Russian state-controlled media” even before the ban and its reputation was already affect RT France’s argument that banning the channel contradicts democratic principles of free speech was also not enough to persuade the court, which concluded that the case was not one requiring “urgency.”It also stated that “the balance of interests in question tilts in favor of the Council” since the measures imposed on RT “relate to the need to protect member states against disinformation and destabilization campaigns” which the EU has accused RT of carrying out.The court concluded, however, that “given the exceptional circumstances,” it would rule according to an “accelerated procedure,” so that the broadcaster would get a response “as soon as possible.”RT France Editor-in-Chief Ksenia Fedorova condemned the tribunal’s response, saying that the decision not to “fast-track” the outlet’s lawsuit was taken by the court’s president “single-handedly and without a hearing.” She also said that, among the reasons behind its refusal for an urgent consideration of RT’s claim, was the fact that the EU “does not prevent broadcasting outside the European Union, including in French-speaking Africa,” or the implementation of the “other activities” of RT France in the EU, in addition to broadcasting.Another lawsuit by RT France will be considered by the Grand Chamber of the EU Tribunal, Fedorova said.The European Council’s decision to ban RT France was condemned by the French National Union of Journalists, which called it “a dangerous precedent for the freedom of the press in Europe.”Meanwhile, Fedorova also said that several Russian employees of RT France have had their personal payroll accounts blocked by Societe General bank.“This is real discrimination based on nationality. France is hitting another bottom,” she wrote on Telegram, later saying that the bank would unblock the accounts within one or two days following some “checks.”"

But it is early in the conflict, other officials caution, and that conclusion may prove premature,” the newspaper detailed.Moscow launched its attack on Ukraine in late February, citing as reasons NATO’s creeping expansion into the neighboring state, the bloc’s refusal to provide security guarantees to Russia, and Kiev’s failure to resolve the eight-year conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.The US and Western powers called the move an act of unprovoked aggression. They imposed unprecedentedly harsh economic sanctions against Russia and pledged to ramp up arms supplies to Ukraine. Despite pleas from Kiev, the West refused to act militarily, citing concerns that it could result in a world war.Russia has said it considers the sanctions a form of warfare. This week, President Vladimir Putin announced that the country will demand payment in rubles rather than dollars or euros for the natural gas it sells to “unfriendly nations,” adding that Russia no longer trusts currencies controlled by the Western financial system.The list of unfriendly nations – the ones that have imposed sanctions against Russia – includes most European countries. The EU received around 40% of its gas supplies from Russia before the conflict broke out.Washington’s belief that Russia may use nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons in Ukraine is based on the presumption that Moscow expected the Ukraine offensive to be short and is now at an impasse due to the resistance of the Ukrainian forces. Such a strike would up the ante for Kiev and send a signal to NATO not to interfere, the reasoning goes.Russia has said it is not using the full scale of its military might against Ukraine to avoid unnecessary civilian casualties. It denies possessing stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons that could be deployed on the battlefield. Its nuclear arsenal, according to its own doctrine, is reserved for extreme situations in which the existence of the country comes under threat."

The organization proposes reducing the speed limit on highways by 10kph, banning the use of cars on Sundays, reducing public transport tariffs, stimulating car-sharing, expanding remote work to three days a week, and promoting the use of high-speed and night trains instead of flights, as well as the broader use of electric vehicles.“This would significantly reduce potential strains at a time when a large amount of Russian supplies may no longer reach the market and the peak demand season of July and August is approaching,” the IEA said in a press release. According to the organization, practical action by governments and citizens can significantly reduce the demand for oil and reduce consumer spending on automobile fuel.The warning comes as oil supplies from Russia have been put in jeopardy amid sanctions imposed on the country over its military operation in Ukraine. Russia is the world’s largest exporter of the commodity to global markets, and the third-largest oil-producing country in the world.The US and UK said earlier this month they would stop buying Russian oil, while the EU is still divided on the issue. The IEA estimated in its March report that Russia may lose roughly one-third of its total oil production due to economic sanctions.Meanwhile, the anti-Russia policies have been backfiring on states that introduced them. Inflation in both the US and EU has been soaring to multiple-year highs, with the costs for energy contributing the most to rising prices.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

India, China, and others have ignored western sanctions and started taking steps to avert what the Kremlin calls the West's “economic war” against Russia.","The financial sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and its allies will gradually dilute the dominance of the greenback, resulting in other currencies playing a more prominent role in the international monetary system, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. In an interview with British daily newspaper, the Financial Times, Gita Gopinath, the IMF's first deputy managing director, predicted the emergence of small currency blocks based on trade between separate groups of countries in response to measures taken by western nations against Russia. Western countries have imposed severe sanctions on Russian financial institutions, including the central bank, and frozen forex reserves worth around $300 billion stashed in US dollars. ""Countries tend to accumulate reserves in the currencies which they use to trade with the rest of the world, and in which they borrow from the rest of the world, so you might see some slow-moving trends towards other currencies playing a bigger role [in reserve assets],"" she observed. Gopinath's observations come days after the Reserve Bank of India voiced similar concerns, saying countries may choose to diversify their forex reserves away from US dollars in the wake of the US decision to freeze Russia's reserves. The IMF's economist noted a 10 percent reduction in the dollar's share of international reserves over the past two decades. The India-born economist also added that digital currency will get even ""greater attention since the recent episodes, which draws us to the question of international regulation"". Several experts also forecast increasing interest rates on US Treasury bonds, indicating a weakening inclination to store their reserves in US currency.  Ten-year bond yields jumped to 2.35 percent from 1.7 percent since Russia began a special military operation in Ukraine to demilitarise and de-Nazify the eastern European nation. "

You’re going to see women, young people standing in the middle, in the front of a damn tank saying ‘I’m not leaving, I’m holding my ground’,” Biden told members of the US Army’s 82nd Airborne Division stationed in Poland.Biden tells the 82nd Airborne they're going to Ukraine: ""You’re going to see when you’re there, you’re going to see women, young people standing in the middle, in the front of a damn tank saying 'I’m not leaving.'"" pic.twitter.com/M2nu77yUw7Biden mentioned the same scenes of civilians blocking tanks – widely publicized by pro-Ukrainian outlets – earlier on Friday as well, calling the incidents “Tiananmen Square squared.”The president has thus far remained insistent that American troops will not intervene in Ukraine, and has ruled out establishing a NATO-enforced ‘no-fly zone’ over the country. The latter, he argued, would see the US and its allies commit to an air war against Russia, which would lead to a “third world war.”It is unclear what Biden meant when he told the troops “some of you have already been there.” Members of the Florida National Guard were training with Ukrainian forces when Russia launched its offensive last month, and were swiftly recalled from the country. The 82nd Airborne Division was sent straight to Poland from Fort Bragg in North Carolina in February, although its troops have trained in Ukraine at several points since the 1990s, and the army’s 101st Airborne Division deployed there in 2019.Biden’s statement triggered concern that the US may be preparing to intervene in Ukraine. However, a White House spokesperson said shortly afterwards that, “The president has been clear we are not sending US troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position.”At present, there are around 100,000 US troops in Europe, the most deployed to the continent since 2005. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said that the conflict in Ukraine has created a “new security reality” in Europe, one that the Cold War-era alliance will meet with more military spending and more deployments of troops and equipment to Eastern Europe. "

That will cause even more suffering, even more deaths, even more destruction,” Stoltenberg, who is expected to extend his term as head of the alliance for another year due to the situation in Ukraine, said.Declaring a no-fly zone means NATO would need to “massively attack Russian air defense systems in Russia, in Belarus and in Ukraine, and also be ready to shoot down Russian planes,” he noted.“And then the risk for a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia will be very high, and that will cause more deaths and more destruction.”Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the bloc to provide “military assistance without restrictions,” in a video address to the leaders of NATO member states, saying that Russia is using its “entire arsenal” to fight his country and has “invested crazy money in death while the world invested in life.”“It feels like we’re in a gray zone, between the West and Russia, defending our common values,” Zelensky said, adding that the “scariest thing during a war” is “not to have clear answers to requests for help.”The Ukrainian president suggested that NATO could give Ukraine “1% of all your planes, 1% of all your tanks.”“I don’t blame NATO. You shouldn’t. It’s not your rockets and bombs that are destroying our cities,” Zelensky said, adding that the bloc “can still prevent Ukrainians from dying from Russian strikes” by providing Ukraine with “all the weapons” it needs.He concluded his emotional speech by saying, “after such a war against Russia,” NATO should never tell Ukraine that its army “does not meet NATO standards,” apparently referring to the lack of clarity with regard to when Kiev would finally be able to join the bloc.Stoltenberg, describing the alliance’s red lines, said the bloc “is always ready to defend, to protect and to react to any type of attack on a NATO Allied country.”On Wednesday, Stoltenberg revealed that NATO leaders are prepared to approve at the summit a further increase in the number of troops stationed in Eastern Europe. These forces will remain there “as long as necessary,” he said.NATO’s eastward expansion and the possibility of Ukraine becoming a member were among the reasons Russia launched the offensive in the neighboring country.Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and Russia’s recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked, denying claims it was planning to retake the Donbass republics by force."

The latter urged EU nations to cut all business ties with Moscow and help supply Kiev with weapons.,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has stated that Budapest will be standing up for its own interests and not for Ukrainian or Russian interests in the ongoing situation in Ukraine. The moment came as he responded to criticism by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Orban called Kiev's stance to request NATO's involvement and weapons supplies understandable, but stressed that Hungary is not Ukraine or Russia and has its own interests that need to be defended. The prime minister added that both covert and overt discussions are constantly taking place on the matter of the EU and NATO's involvement in the conflict in Ukraine. He noted that Budapest is consistently being forced to defend its own interests and stressed the importance of a government that can do so, instead of simply obeying the will of other countries. Since the start of the Russian special operation in Ukraine to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" the country, Hungary has provided refuge to Ukrainians fleeing their homeland, but systematically refused to provide military assistance to Kiev or allow weapons shipments through its territory. This stance drew President Zelensky's criticism during his address to EU leaders during a virtual conference on 24 March. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk went even further rhetorically wondering if Budapest refuses to back new anti-Russian sanctions against the energy sector because it wants ""Russian gas with a discount"" or because it silently ""dreams of"" Transcarpathia – a region in Western Ukraine with a notable ethnic Hungarian minority. EU countries previously slapped Russia with harsh economic sanctions targeting its Central Bank, access to European financial markets, the Russian banking sector, as well as certain officials and businesses allegedly connected to the Kremlin. Brussels stopped short of banning Russian gas and oil purchases, but vowed to lower them by the end of the year. The bloc's leading politicians did not explain how they plan to replace the gas and oil supplies from Russia, which make up around one-third of overall energy shipments to the EU. Moscow recently responded to the sanctions by unveiling plans to make ""unfriendly nations"" pay for Russian natural gas and crude shipments using its national currency – the ruble.

Dotcom recalled an article in the Japanese media outlet Nikkei that revealed US plans to build a ""network of precision-strike missiles"" stationed on the islands surrounding China. The system would reportedly be deployed on Okinawa, in the Philippines, and Taiwan – a breakaway Chinese province – as a part of $27.4 billion in spending allocated for the Indo-Pacific theatre over the next six years. Beijing has repeatedly warned Washington against selling weapons to Taiwan and has called such actions unacceptable. Kim Dotcom argued that even if the Ukraine crisis doesn't trigger a global one, US plans to deploy missiles around China definitely would. Back in March 2021, then-US top commander for the Indo-Pacific region Admiral Philip Davidson mentioned in his testimony before a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that Washington hoped to create a network of launch sites around China, brandishing land-based long-range missiles. Furthermore, an unclassified Indo-Pacific Command budget document, submitted to the Senate committee, confirmed that Taiwan and other islands, such as Okinawa and the Senkakus, are being looked at as potential sites for the missiles. The goal of the system is stated as being a deterrence against ""acts of aggression or coercion"" targeting US allies. Specifically, the Pentagon was concerned about Beijing's alleged plans to seize Taiwan by force, Davidson said. He elaborated that according to the estimates, China might make a move in that direction within the decade, or at the earliest in six years, the admiral predicted. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Heavily promoted in advance as a vital lifeline to Kiev that would safeguard citizens, defend refugees, and protect ""democracy,""references to the supposedly landmark move immediately vanished from the mainstream media following its White House approval, and have remained absent ever since.One explanation for this informational deficit could well be that in reality, the legislation serves no tangible benevolent ends of any kind, in fact providing an effective blank cheque for proxy war, and untrammelled embezzlement by US government agencies and contractors.This much is certain from a precursory analysis of the bill’s lengthy underlying text. The term “military” crops up over 350 times, “humanitarian” just 58. What’s more, almost half the headline $13.6 billion wellspring ($6.5 billion) has already been allocated - to cover the cost of weapons shipments to Ukraine and the buildup of NATO forces in January and February this year. In other words, before the war had even formally begun.Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reports published in the weeks prior to the war commencing highlight some of the gruesome purposes to which this “lethal aid” may have been put. In one representative filing on February 18, its investigators documented how a kindergarten in breakaway Lugansk had been struck by shrapnel, while 20 children were being taught inside. Luckily, they all escaped uninjured.The same report noted that, “in violation of withdrawal lines,” OSCE observers identified placement of surface-to-air-missile systems, howitzers, anti-tank guns and multiple-launch rocket systems in government-controlled areas of Donetsk. Neither this blatantly belligerent activity, nor the Organization recording how the overwhelming majority of missile and rocket attacks carried out in the days leading up to Russia's military attack were targeted at breakaway areas by government forces, has ever been mentioned by a Western news outlet.This may be partially explained by the US, UK and Canada pulling out of the OSCE mission in Ukraine in mid-February, allegedly due to fears of an impending Russian assault – another rationale for the English-speaking trio’s withdrawal could be that revealing the reality of egregious government abuses in Eastern Ukraine was problematic, and politically unpopular at home.The mainstream code of silence on such crimes against humanity is no longer rigorously maintained. In fact, many current and former Western officials have been unabashed in confirming Washington’s overriding priority is arming Kiev to the teeth, to foment a protracted insurrection and trap Russia in a bloodspattered quagmire, in the manner of the Soviet-Afghan War.This comparison was drawn favorably by US lawmaker Adam Smith, House Armed Services Committee chair, after legislation to establish a “Ukraine Resistance Fund” was recently drafted. Speaking to MSNBC on February 28, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton echoed his endorsement, stating “the model that people are now looking toward” in respect of the Ukraine crisis is the “armed insurgency [that] basically drove the Russians [sic] out of Afghanistan.”Ironically, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was ordered by a Ukrainian, Leonid Brezhnev, back in 1979.Washington’s shameful experience of funding, arming and training the Afghan resistance is much-venerated in modern US foreign policy circles today, despite the strategy creating the conditions that led to the tragedy of 9/11, on the alleged basis it was fundamental to the fall of Communism. However, many mainstream historians - and indeed the CIA’s then-Soviet Affairs chief - largely or completely discount the Afghan war as a factor in the Soviet Union’s collapse.In its defense, the “aid” bill contains some protocols related to food and medical aid, although details on what will be sent to whom and where are troublingly unforthcoming.The State Department is afforded lone responsibility for deciding every aspect of distribution, with no apparent obligation on the part of officials to publicly account for any allocations - raising the obvious prospect that the intended beneficiaries of this ostensibly humanitarian disbursement could well be soldiers, mercenaries or guerilla fighters.Conversely, it could be that these projects are concerned with selling inflammatory, indirect US intervention in the Ukraine crisis to its own population, on a false prospectus.This was very much the case with ‘aid’ projects during the two-decade-long Western occupation of Afghanistan, as a withering August 2021 official review of US reconstruction efforts in the country during that deplorable period made abundantly clear. The appraisal found the amount of money being spent on reconstruction projects, such as the creation of new hospitals, was “the most important measure of success” for US officials - rather than the projects being worthwhile or even remotely viable.In turn, false claims of those projects’ ‘success’ were then fed to US lawmakers and citizens in order to convince them that Washington’s ongoing, costly presence in Afghanistan wasn’t the total, counterproductive failure it actually was. This “institutional drive to produce good news stories” produced a situation in which Washington spent money “faster than it could be accounted for,” so as to generate positive press coverage “as quickly as possible.”As part of this cynical push, representatives of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) were frequently “bulldozed” by their military counterparts into pursuing projects in areas of Afghanistan “far too dangerous for them to have a stabilizing effect.” In essence, the bigger the associated risks, the greater the ‘success’ that could be claimed.The Agency was therefore forced to depend on contractors, and “sometimes unable to establish with confidence even the most basic information” about a project’s progress as a result. Despite this, USAID’s reliance on these external actors endured unabated, creating a cottage industry of companies willing to defraud the Agency, and suppliers eager to help them do it.On the subject of USAID, the organization is frequently referenced in the new aid bill, for example sharing a $145-million slush fund of “aid to independent media, journalists and civil activists” and counteract “disinformation and provide factual data about the situation in Ukraine” with the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), parent of the CIA-created state-run outlets Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, among others.USAID’s status as a “humanitarian” organization has long-been questioned, with many charging that it acts as an effective CIA front. A proposal published by the Agency’s internal “global development lab” in February 2019 should surely put to bed any doubts that it doesn’t.The paper advocated for USAID staffers to be trained as special operations forces in order for them to effectively and intimately collaborate with military and intelligence agencies, so they act as “super enablers” and optimally serve US “national security” interests through “a mix of offensive, defensive, and stability operations in extremis conditions.”With the US spending more on defense than the next 11 countries combined, and the White House having just requested a $31-billion war chest for the 2022/23 financial year, bringing the total budget to $813 billion, it’s no wonder Washington only views matters through a military lens. It has no other choice."

I was expressing moral outrage that I feel, and I make no apologies for it.”Photos from the press conference show Biden carrying a small card, entitled “Tough Putin Q&A Talking Points,” in which the president was instructed to answer such a question as follows:“I was expressing the moral outrage I felt toward the actions of this man. I was not articulating a change in policy.”Biden cheat sheet lol pic.twitter.com/aVes86U8PsDespite sticking to what he was instructed to say, Biden wandered off-script later in the briefing. “It’s more an aspiration than anything. He shouldn’t be in power. There’s no…I mean, people like this shouldn’t be ruling countries, but they do,” he said, before telling another reporter that he doesn’t believe Russia would interpret such a statement as a declaration of policy.“Nobody believes… I was talking about taking down Putin. Nobody believes that,” Biden said.Biden’s apparent befuddlement has already raised eyebrows several times in recent days. Whilst on his visit to Poland, the president seemingly told American soldiers that they would soon be deployed to Ukraine, before his officials walked back the statement, saying “The president has been clear we are not sending US troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position.”Likewise, despite Biden’s Vice President, National Security Advisor, Secretary of State and Press Secretary all portraying US sanctions on Russia as a deterrent to Putin, Biden declared last week that “sanctions never deter.”Biden has relied on printed answer cards when dealing with the press before, and has also called on reporters during press conferences from prepared lists, mentioning on one such occasion in November that “they gave me a list of the people I’m going to call on.”Republicans have pointed to these incidents, as well as to examples of Biden losing his train of thought mid-reply and appearing visibly lost and confused, as indicators of the president’s declining cognitive abilities. Biden’s approval rating sank to a new low of 40% in an NBC News poll published on Sunday, with just 29% of respondents expressing “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of confidence in the president’s ability to handle the crisis in Ukraine. An ABC News poll taken last month found that 54% of Americans thought he lacked the “mental sharpness it takes to serve effectively as president.”"

The Bulgarian PM said no.","Bulgarian citizens rallied on Saturday against giving its ""few remaining weapons"" to Ukraine and demanded the withdrawal of NATO from the country. Demonstrators gathered in front of the Bulgarian Ministry of Defence, where Austin and Petkov met for a joint press conference, waving Bulgarian and Russian flags. They were heard chanting, ""NATO Out"". Similar protests took place in Rome and Piza, Italy, where activists of a major Italian trade union, USB, opposed sending weapons to Ukraine and called on the government to ditch NATO. While many NATO members have pledged to pump Ukraine with weapons, the Bulgarian government has not been particularly supportive of the idea, with Petkov dismissing reports that Sofia discussed the topic as ""fake news"".  ""We are working together to reinforce the eastern flank of NATO, but nothing more than that has been discussed"", he said. Bulgaria has been a member of NATO since 2004, when it along with several other Eastern European nations was welcomed into the alliance following the ""Big Bang"" enlargement round announced at the November 2002 Prague summit. On 24 February, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg announced that the alliance would be putting its ships and aircraft on high alert together with the reinforcement of NATO's eastern flank. However, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has desperately begged Western states to send troops to fight for Kiev, they have repeatedly stated that Ukraine is not a member of NATO (and is unlikely to be one in the near future), basically demonstrating that despite their rhetoric, the Ukrainian crisis is not their business.  Zelensky's request for a no-fly zone was also snubbed by the United States, as Washington has no desire to risk an open military confrontation with Russia. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

He reiterated his willingness to hold direct talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.“I have been ready for the past two years,” Zelensky said.While, in a significant concession, he acknowledged last week that Ukraine would not join NATO, he suggested on Sunday that if the bloc did want to admit his nation, it should happen “immediately.”“If we were a NATO member, a war wouldn’t have started. I’d like to receive security guarantees for my country, for my people,” he said.Addressing Putin’s allegations that there are neo-Nazis in Ukraine’s government, Zelensky described them as “laughable.” Such accusations raised “many questions” about the Russian president’s goals and “what else he is capable of doing for the sake of his ambitions,” he said.On Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov defined Russia’s demands as “absolutely minimal” and suggested the Ukrainian delegation “was being held by the hand, most likely by the Americans,” who he said were not allowing Kiev to agree to Moscow’s requests.On Sunday, following talks during the week in the capitals of both Russia and Ukraine, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the two sides were closer to an agreement on “critical” issues.Ukrainian presidential aide Mikhail Podolyak earlier estimated that negotiations on a peace treaty might take “from a few days to one and half weeks.”Moscow launched an offensive in Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

Producer prices also registered a jump of 1.4% from the previous month.According to the FSO, the latest report did not take into account the effects of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.Energy prices were up 68% from February 2021, the report says, adding that, stripping out energy costs, producer prices rose 12.4% year-over-year.Germany and other European countries have been under pressure to impose more sanctions on Russia in response to the military conflict in Ukraine.Earlier this month, the European Commission said that the bloc would phase out its dependency on Russian oil, gas, and coal by 2030. However, unlike the US and UK, EU countries have stopped short of an immediate ban, citing rising energy prices and the necessity to replenish gas reserves before next winter.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

The operation is the culmination of a security crisis which started in 2014 after a Western-backed coup in Kiev.","Ukrainian forces in Kharkov region opened fire toward the Russian border several hours before the Russian military operation in Ukraine began, an eyewitness has said. “Sometime at about half past midnight I heard a noise, an unusual noise. I looked through the window and counted about 15 BTRs [armoured personnel vehicles], with guns and stuff. The thing is, the settlement has no lights at night, but I’m certain that even more of them passed. And after some time I heard shelling,” Andreev said. “I got the impression that the villages situated from the north to the south toward the city of Kharkov were to be destroyed. This was shown by the further developments, because the village of Tsirkuny was razed to the ground, the village of Tishki was razed to the ground, and up to Lyptsi as well,"" Andreev said. The eyewitness said initially, when the evacuation of civilians in Lyptsi to Russia began, things seemed quiet. “But afterward, they say there was shooting at evacuees as well. There were yellow buses [with signs that] read 'children'.” Russia and its Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Militia allies began a military operation in Ukraine on the morning of 24 February. The operation followed weeks of escalating tensions as Ukrainian forces carried out shelling, sabotage and sniper attacks against Donbass forces. In early March, the Russian military released documents indicating that Kiev had planned to conduct a full-scale assault on the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. The Russian-led military operation in Ukraine followed nearly eight years of grinding civil conflict in the Donbass. "

Earlier, the Swedish daily Expressen reported that some of the 5,000 Pansarskott 86 anti-tank rocket launchers Sweden had sent to Ukraine were seized by the Russian army. Arms researcher Rein Pella ventured that the technology will likely be sent to Moscow to study and copy the technology. At the same time, he ventured that the arms in question “have no major military benefit”. The Finnish Defence Ministry claimed that the aid takes into account both Ukraine's needs and Finland's resources, stressing that it doesn't put the country's defence capability at risk.In February, Finland pledged to support Ukraine with 2,000 bulletproof vests, 2,000 composite helmets, 100 stretchers and equipment for two emergency medical care stations.Thereafter, the country decided to deliver additional military aid in the form of 2,500 assault rifles, 150,000 cartridges for the rifles, 1,500 single-shot anti-tank weapons and 70,000 combat ration packages. Following the start of Russia's special operation in Ukraine meant to protect the inhabitants of the People's Republics of Donbass and demilitarise Kiev, numerous European countries announced arms help to Ukraine, with Finland and Sweden historically breaking their principle of not providing weapons to a nation in conflict.

During the operation, NATO aircraft flew 38,400 sorties, including 10,484 strike sorties, and released 23,614 air munitions, killing at least 2,000 civilians and injuring 12,500.","""Twenty-three years after the NATO aggression in Yugoslavia, the memories among the Serbian population are very vivid,"" says Dr. Srdjan Sljukic, a professor of sociology at the University of Novi Sad, Serbia. ""The anti-NATO feelings dominate not only in Serbia, but also among the Serbs in Republika Srpska (Bosnia and Herzegovina), in Montenegro, etc. In spite of very strong NATO propaganda in the Serbian media that are controlled by the West and the activity of NGOs financed by the West, over 80% of the Serbian population are against the idea that our country should join NATO."" The campaign was kicked off after the failure of the Rambouillet talks between members of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) – a Kosovar Albania militia that was regarded as a terrorist organisation by Belgrade. Two conditions inserted into the agreement were unacceptable to the Serbian side, according to the publicist: first, was a binding referendum on Kosovo independence three years after the signing of the agreement; second, the free movement of NATO personnel under arms through the territory of Serbia itself, to have access to Kosovo. In fact, the US deliberately blocked any peaceful settlement to the conflict in former Yugoslavia to open the door to the military campaign, according to Daniel Kovalik, author and adjunct professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh, in the US state of Pennsylvania. It was former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger who admitted in an interview with the UK Daily Telegraph on June 28, 1999: ""The Rambouillet text, which called on Serbia to admit NATO troops throughout Yugoslavia, was a provocation, an excuse to start bombing."" According to RAND's 2001 study, titled European Contribution to Operation Allied Force, NATO's military planners started preparing for a possible operation in Kosovo in May and June 1998. NATO was tasked to develop a wide range of alternative options, from preventive deployments to a full ground invasion to stop the Yugoslavian government from preventing Kosovo's secession. Then-US Senator Joe Biden was an ardent proponent of a NATO invasion of Yugoslavia. “If I were president, I would just bomb Serbian President Slobodan Milošević,” Biden said in October 1998. ""The bombing was intended to destroy Serbia as an independent country, to occupy 15% of its sovereign territory and eventually recognise the secession of that territory as an independent country in its own right,"" says Srdja Trifkovic. ""So one could say, with equal validity, that if there was a headline in the Völkischer Beobachter in Berlin on 22 of June 1941, that the Wehrmacht was opening the door to peace in the East, that's exactly the same validity. The cover of Time claimed that what NATO had done was opening the door to peace."" The Clinton administration's bombing campaign targeted not only the Yugoslavian armed forces. According to some estimates, NATO destroyed or damaged some 25,000 residential buildings, 470 km of roads, 595 km of railway infrastructure, 14 airports, 19 hospitals, 20 health centers, 69 schools, 18 kindergartens, 176 cultural monuments and 38 bridges, causing up to $100 billion in economic losses. NATO aggression provoked a humanitarian disaster and an ethnic cleansing of the Serbs, according to Sljukic: ""They were forced to leave their homes and become refugees in their own country,"" he notes. NATO crimes against Serbs in Yugoslavia have never been thoroughly investigated and those responsible had never been held accountable, according to some observers. US-NATO military moves in Europe did not end with carving out Kosovo, dismantling Yugoslavia and redrawing the European map. Having got away with an illegal bombing campaign, the Western military bloc continued its march to the east, welcoming new members and deploying weapons on Russia's doorstep, according to scholars. ""NATO expansion to the east has, as many predicted, led precisely to what we see today – the conflict between Russia and Ukraine,"" claims Kovalik. ""The US clearly wanted that conflict, it did everything it could to bring it about and is now trying to prevent peace at all costs."" There are parallels between NATO's invasion of Yugoslavia and a similar move by the Kremlin in Ukraine, according to the observers. The member states of the western military bloc turned a blind eye to eight years of Ukrainian shelling in Donbass and widely-reported neo-Nazi battalions, according to Srdja Trifkovic. In a similar vein, the US and its allies gloss over the crimes by the KLA, ""in the complete avoidance of any discussion of extremely valid Serbian arguments, both historical and legal,"" he notes. What is driving the US-led NATO bloc is American exceptionalism that has, since WWII, been ""the most dangerous doctrine in the world,"" stresses Kovalik. ""[This doctrine] has justified some of the most brutal wars, such as those against Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Panama and Syria, in the name of ''democracy and freedom' when the goal of these wars was anything but,"" the academic offered.

We discussed everything, we have a complete understanding of the situation, but I will not say what we will do next.""'Gifted' access to the World Cup? We must play, get this ticket. I speak only for myself – there is also the [views of the] president and the executive committee of the UAF [Ukrainian FA]. But personally, I am against it – you need to play.""Andriy Yarmolenko, an English Premier League forward for West Ham and one of Petrakov's key players, has also shunned the prospect of Ukraine being granted automatic entry to the World Cup.Petrakov initially said that he expected the playoff matches to take place on their original dates.Responding days after the conflict began on February 24, the 64-year-old said he had spoken to Yarmolenko and compatriot Oleksandr Zinchenko, a defender for Manchester City, and shared their ""shock"" at the situation.Ukraine, ranked 27th in the world by FIFA, face a tough challenge to qualify. Scotland are 12 places behind them but have won their last four competitive matches at home, while Wales are ranked 18th and were inspired by four-time Champions League winner Gareth Bale in their 2-1 semifinal win over Austria in Cardiff.Former Dynamo Kiev assistant Petrakov was appointed as Ukraine legend Andriy Shevchenko's successor in August, overseeing the end of an unbeaten qualification campaign in which only World Cup holders France finished ahead of his team.""We still have April and May to come and we will see what happens then. We are supposed to playing Scotland in June as well as Nations League games,"" Petrakov told Football 1 via ESPN this week. ""But we can't think about them at the moment given the current situation.""Petrakov has also vowed never to speak Russian again despite describing the language as his mother tongue."

Out of the 1,642 surveyed individuals, 67 percent said they will have problems paying for heating and energy. More than 80 percent said they are going to avoid making large purchases, while 55 percent plan to cut spending on leisure activities and 37 percent will try to save on clothes. Only 31 percent of those surveyed listed Ukraine as a top concern. About a third of respondents said the Ukraine crisis and the Western anti-Russia sanctions, which are leading to spikes in gas and oil prices, will push back the date they can retire, according to the Sunday Express survey. The living standards think tank Resolution Foundation on Thursday warned that 1.3 million people in the UK will be pushed into absolute poverty after the government failed to help low-income families cope with the cost-of-living crisis in the so-called Spring Statement made by Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak. On Wednesday, Sunak announced a 5 pence per litre cut in fuel duty and an increase in the threshold at which people pay national insurance contributions, benefiting around 30 million workers with a tax cut worth more than £330 ($435).

But it’s also been totally unsurprising,” she said on Friday.While explaining that India had strengthened its ties with Russia for its own safety as its relationship with China deteriorated, the American diplomat suggested the country was now thinking “long and hard” about its decision to cozy up to Moscow and suggested the US should focus on providing India with “options.” This she characterized as “providing for its strategic autonomy,” though her approach seemed aimed at driving India directly into the arms of the US and NATO rather than giving it any ‘autonomy’ in the matter.Rapp-Hooper suggested Washington not stop at trying to talk India out of buying Russian armaments, noting that “we have a number of partners that have chosen to keep their chips in with Russia, in terms of their defense procurement, in part as a hedge against China.” These countries are now rethinking those decisions and need replacements for those weapons systems, she said, implying the US should guide them toward purchasing its own systems or those built by allies.New Delhi buys more weapons from Russia than any other country, having purchased almost half (49.3%) of its arms from Moscow for what has amounted to $6.5 billion over the last five years. This has unsurprisingly rubbed Washington the wrong way, leading it to threaten sanctions over India’s 2018 purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defense system.While India has canceled several other weapons orders from Russia in the wake of the Ukraine offensive, including MiG-29 fighters, helicopters and anti-tank weapons, Washington is hoping to use the previous purchases as leverage to convince India to further distance itself from Moscow. New Delhi has thus far declined to join in the sanctions pile-on against Russia, and has not explicitly condemned its actions in Ukraine.However, some have worried that the US sanctioning India will drive it away from the Quad alliance, which includes Japan and Australia and is aimed at reining in China’s influence in the Asia-Pacific region."

During a regular press briefing, its spokesperson, Major General Igor Konashenkov, said the “planned regrouping of troops is taking place [in the] Kiev and Chernigov areas.”He explained that the initial stage of Moscow’s military operation involved forcing Ukraine's military “to concentrate its forces, means, resources and military equipment to hold large settlements in these areas, including Kiev,” to tie them up, while avoiding storming the cities, and to defeat them in such a way that would prevent them from using these forces “in the main direction of operations of our Armed Forces – in the Donbass.”The Donbass refers to the territory of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, recognised as independent states by Moscow, last month.Simultaneously, according to the ministry spokesman, Russia, in order to create “all the necessary conditions for carrying out the final stage of the operation to liberate the People’s Republics of Donbass” continued targeting “long-term defensive fortifications created by the Kiev regime over eight years.”All main lines of communications, supply and approach of reserves are taken under full control. The air defense systems of Ukraine, the airfield infrastructure, the largest military depots, training and concentration centers for mercenaries were destroyed. Work on them continues. Thus, all the main tasks of the Russian Armed Forces in the directions of Kiev and Chernigov have been completed.Therefore, Konashenkov underlined, the purpose of the Russian forces’ regrouping “is to intensify operations in priority areas and, above all, to complete the operation for the complete liberation of the Donbass.”On Tuesday, following another round of the negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul, Russian Deputy Minister of Defense Alexander Fomin announced that “a decision was made to drastically, in several times, reduce the military activity on the approaches to Kiev and Chernigov.” He explained this decision, on the one hand, by the fact that the talks with Kiev were entering “the practical stage,” and, on the other hand, by Russia’s wish “to increase mutual trust and to create the necessary conditions for the further development of negotiations.” Thus, the announcement was considered by many as a ‘goodwill gesture’ from Moscow.However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday warned against excessive optimism. He said that the agreement of the Ukrainian side to start to “formulate concretely and to put down on paper what it proposes” has so far been the only positive outcome of the talks.“As for the rest, so far, let’s say, we cannot state anything very promising, any breakthroughs, there is still a very, very long work to be done,” Peskov underlined.Russia’s lead negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, in his turn, said on Wednesday that Ukraine agreed in principle to officially become a neutral country. Ukraine’s bid to join NATO was one of the reasons Moscow said it launched a military campaign against the country last month.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

Moscow and Kiev have previously held three rounds of in-person talks and further contacts via video link, but the exchanges have failed to yield a major result.“We hope the meetings will be beneficial for both countries and the region, as Turkey is deeply worried about the conflict,” President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, welcoming the negotiators. He also expressed hope that the summit would pave a way for direct talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dimtry Kuleba said, on Monday, that Kiev expected “humanitarian questions” to be resolved during the encounter, adding that “the maximum program is reaching an agreement on a ceasefire.”Turkey also hosted discussions between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kuleba in Antalya on March 10.The sides have failed to reach significant progress in resolving the conflict during previous rounds of talks. They did, however, agree to establish civilian evacuation routes from besieged cities, including Mariupol, an Azov Sea port that is completely surrounded by Russian and Donbass troops.Moscow’s stated list of demands for Kiev includes the recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, and the breakaway Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent states. The republics broke away from Ukraine shortly after the 2014 coup in Kiev. Crimea voted to leave Ukraine and join Russia in the same year.Russia also said it was seeking the “demilitarization” and “denazification” of Ukraine.Moscow wants Ukraine to officially declare itself a neutral country, forever renouncing its bid to join NATO, the US-led military bloc Russia said it views as a threat. Ukrainian officials have said they were open to discuss their country’s neutrality, but demanded security guarantees from the West, as well as from Russia.Last month, Russia launched a military attack on Ukraine following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

The Financial Times (FT) called Biden's line about Putin a ""turning point"" in America's approach to the conflict in Ukraine. Prior, Washington had tried to balance its rhetoric, while now it's transitioned to a ""fierce strategic rivalry"" with Russia. The head of the US Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Haass, criticised Biden's closing line about Putin, noting that ousting the Russian president is not something Washington has the tools to accomplish. At the same time, the president's speech created risks that Putin will ""reject compromise, escalate, or both"", Haass warned. Michael Goodwin, a contributor for the New York Post, condemned the entire Biden speech and specifically targeted his line about Putin. Goodwin argued that it would ""dramatically raise the stakes with Russia"" as the US administration was seeking to lower them. Joe Biden's entire speech, which was dedicated to the topic of a ""long war"" and rarely touched upon peace, suggests that a ""new Cold War [is] on our hands"" with POTUS as its Western leader, David Gergen, a former White House adviser, told the Financial Times. Gergen cautioned that such a speech heavily suggests that the current conflict won't be ""settled at the negotiating table"". Even before Biden could depart Poland, where he delivered his speech, the White House was quick to rescind its last line – about Vladimir Putin – and assured that POTUS was not calling for regime change in Russia. Furthermore, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tried to interpret Biden's words differently the next day, claiming that POTUS meant that ""Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression"". Western commentators, however, remained unconvinced, warning that the same is likely to be true for the Kremlin, and harshly criticised – either Biden for making reckless comments off the cuff or his team for allowing such a line in the text of the speech. FT suggested that even a single hint that Washington is contemplating regime change in Moscow might prompt the Kremlin to believe that the US is ""losing control of its message about the war"". Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, insisted that Biden's message will be strongly believed in Moscow. Haass stated that the line being off-script (something that has not yet been officially confirmed), will only reinforce the Kremlin's fears as it will consider Biden's words ""this man cannot remain in power"" as his genuine belief. Putin heard a call for regime change ""loud and clear"" in Biden's speech, former Defence Intelligence Agency officer, Rebekah Koffler, told Fox News. She claimed that Putin has long suspected the US of trying to stage a ""colour revolution"" or a civil uprising in Russia, and now he's got his confirmation. Koffler lashed out at the controversial line in Biden's script and called the people who prepared it ""incompetent"", since this phrase failed to ""minimise security threats"" for the American people. New York Post contributor Michael Goodwin stressed that in the context of Biden's speech in Poland, his phrase about Putin not being allowed to ""remain in power"" is impossible to be comprehended as anything but a call for regime change. The White House might explain itself in the future, but it will never be ""good enough"", Goodwin warned. The Biden administration, for example, the national security adviser or the secretary of state, must reach out to Moscow and elaborate on Joe Biden's comment, Richard Haass said. They must explain to the Kremlin that the comment was made in the heat of the moment and that it in no way reflects US foreign policy, the president of the think tank suggested.

Pauken II, a Beijing-based Asia-Pacific affairs commentator and author of US vs. China: From Trade War to Reciprocal Deal. ""Anytime a nation anticipates the US will rupture bilateral relations with them, the rival nations to the US will demand a withdrawal of their foreign currency and gold reserves from Wall Street banks. The nation making the request will spark a banking panic as bankers will know the other sovereign government is planning to hit the US with tough actions. But, if Wall Street bankers refuse to hand over the reserves to the proper owners, you could deem it an 'act of war'"". Pauken does not rule out that many countries that don’t trust the US ""will start to slowly and quietly take out their reserves’ holdings from Wall Street banks"". Consequently, US and European banks will see a trend of foreign nations stopping their business dealings with them and moving their cash back home or to Asian banks, such as in Singapore, according to the Beijing-based commentator. Russia's assets were frozen on 28 February, after Moscow invoked Article 51 of the UN Charter and launched the special operation to de-militarise and de-Nazify Ukraine on 24 February. On 11 March, US President Joe Biden signed an order banning the sale or delivery by any other means of dollar-denominated banknotes to Russia. The move accelerated the process of the de-dollarisation of the Russian economy that has been ongoing since 2014, when the US and its NATO partners went on a sanctions spree in response to Crimea's reunification with Russia. On 18 March, members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), which includes Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan, agreed on a phased transition to settlements in national currencies, according to the head of the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation Maxim Reshetnikov. Earlier, Russia started bilateral trade in national currencies with China, India, Turkey, and Iran. Moscow also diversified its Central Bank's reserves: by mid-2021, just 16.4% of Russia's national wealth was held in US dollars, according to Reuters. Although Russia's de-dollarisation does not pose an immediate threat to the greenback's dominance, according to financial observers, the Biden administration's decision to freeze Russia's assets definitely does. According to Rowley, if central bank assets held in US dollars are no longer inviolate, then other countries could eventually be pushed into ""dumping reserve dollars and cutting dollar reliance in trade, finance and banking"". Another SCMP contributor, Neal Kimberley, a British financial expert and FOREX analyst, shares similar concerns. Kimberley warns that Beijing ""itself might feel that further diversification of China’s $3.2 trillion of foreign reserves would be appropriate"". Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal broke on 15 March that Saudi Arabia is apparently considering pricing some of its oil sales to China in yuan. The WSJ also reported about an upcoming visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Saudi Arabia, ""citing people familiar with the plan"". Both WSJ pieces are referring to the strained relations between Saudi Arabia and, in particular, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and the Biden administration. While The Hill notes that Riyadh used to threaten Washington with moving away from the US dollar in oil trade when US-Saudi relations became tense, Bloomberg suggests that this time Riyadh could have another motive. If Riyadh and Beijing decide to use the yuan in mutual oil trade, it's good news for them, deems Pauken. ""Both countries have little trust in the Biden administration"", the Beijing-based commentator says. ""They anticipate Washington will impose tough economic sanctions on them sooner or later, so they are taking the right steps to overcome the challenges that could await them. By settling energy trade in yuan, they can ignore US-led sanctions"". Washington's move to freeze Russia's dollar assets is likely to trigger a domino effect with other nations diversifying the composition of their own reserves, writes Neal Kimberley in his SCMP op-ed. Eventually, this will result in ""worldwide economic and financial change"", he forecasts. "

He added that ‘Z’ means “Russian war crimes, bombed out cities, thousands of murdered Ukrainians” and said that “public support of this barbarism must be forbidden.”Either the letter “Z” or the letter “V” are the two symbols depicted on all vehicles of the Russian army participating in the military operation in Ukraine. In Russia, both letters have been used to support the Kremlin’s military offensive against Kiev. They are commonly used on banners and car stickers.There are many theories about the origins of the symbol. Some commenters have suggested that “V” and “Z” represent the initials of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Other speculate that they signify the attachment of a particular vehicle to Russia’s Western or Eastern military detachments. Moscow’s Ministry of Defense gave its own explanation in an Instagram post in early March, however, hinting that “Z” stands for “victory” while “V” stands for “truth.”Lithuanian deputies have also proposed criminalizing the letter “Z” along with the St. George ribbon, which is a Russian symbol to commemorate the victory in World War Two.  The legislators proposed equating both with the Nazi swastika and to punish the display of Russian symbols with a €500 fine.Meanwhile, according to the German newspaper Bild, the letter “Z” as a symbol of Russia’s military operation has already been banned in some regions of Germany, including Berlin, Bavaria, Lower Saxony, and North Rhine-Westphalia.Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and Frenchbrokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev says the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the Donbass by force."

This bodes ill for Norway, for which seafood is a major source of income trailing only oil and gas.","As an unexpected consequence, Russia's special operation in Ukraine and ensuing wave of sanctions and countersanctions have sparked massive problems for Norwegian seafood exports. As the airspace over Russia is closed to European aircraft, the transport of goods to the lucrative Asian market must take a major detour south. Longer routes to reach delivery points force cargo planes to take on board much more fuel, which, in turn, means that they can carry less. Getting fresh seafood, one of Norway's key exports trailing only oil and gas, to their important markets in Asia is a top priority for shipping companies. However, the detour coupled with the fact that Russian shipping companies are now unavailable have greatly reduced the capacity of the freight market. This leads to challenges for the Norwegian seafood industry, as the huge Asian market is the most important for fresh and frozen seafood. Additionally, Russia itself is a major importer of shrimp, Atlantic salmon, and trout. Since the Russian airline AirBridgeCargo is no longer allowed to pick up seafood at Oslo Airport with its jumbo jets due to a comprehensive ban, freight operator DB Schenker has calculated that the capacity for shipping to Asia has decreased by 40 to 50 percent, forcing prices to skyrocket. According to DB Schenker communications manager Nils-Petter Buer, the use of southern routes alone to bypass Russian and Ukrainian airspace yields a delay of two hours per flight. Fuel prices have also risen dramatically amid the conflict. Yet another headache for Norwegian exports is that China, one of its main markets, is now hit by anti-pandemic measures and import bans. ""Shanghai, which is the largest import port and aviation hub in mainland China, is now closed for imports"", DB Schenker air freight manager Morten Würgler concluded. The fish and seafood industry is of paramount importance in Norway. With its vast coastline, the oblong country provides ample conditions for domestic fishing and aquaculture. In recent years, revenues generated by fisheries and processing industry have soared. In 2018, the fish and seafood industry reached its highest profit, amounting to approximately 6.5 billion euros ($7.15 billion). The fisheries and aquaculture industry is Norway's largest export industry after oil and gas, with products from captured and farmed fish exported to over 150 countries. Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, after an appeal from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, who have been suffering an eight-year-long war waged against them by Kiev. President Vladimir Putin stressed that Russia's goal was to protect the people of Donbass and that the op aims at the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine.

The announcement came as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan leverages his ties with both countries in an effort to end the ongoing conflict.Initial reports suggest that the sides will sit down at the negotiations table on Monday and continue discussions until Wednesday. However, David Arakhamia, the majority leader of Ukraine's parliament and chief negotiator for Kiev, later clarified that the talks were scheduled to kick off in Turkey's largest city at 10am local time on Tuesday.The Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov also said that he doubted that the meeting would take place on Monday and said Tuesday is a more likely date. The summit in Istanbul was announced by Arakhamia on Sunday. The negotiations are again giving Ankara a prominent role in the process. Turkey hosted the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine in Antalya earlier this month.As a NATO member, the country has tried to walk a fine line between condemning Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine and maintaining its close economic and defense ties with Moscow. Ankara has opposed Western sanctions against Russia, but it also rejected a request to allow Russian warships to sail through the Turkish Straits into the Black Sea.Speaking at the Doha Forum on Sunday, Erdogan’s spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, cautioned against isolating Moscow, acknowledging that Russia “must be heard one way or another.” He added, “If everybody burns bridges with Russia, then who’s going to talk to them, at the end of the day?”  Erdogan reportedly urged Putin in a telephone call on Sunday to bring about a ceasefire and improve humanitarian conditions in Ukraine.Turkey’s position is similar to that of South Africa, where President Cyril Ramaphosa has resisted international pressure to take a tougher anti-Moscow stance and has called for negotiations. Ramaphosa has also offered to mediate Russia-Ukraine peace talks, and said last week that NATO was at least partly to blame for causing the conflict.“The war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region,” the South African president said.Russia attacked neighboring Ukraine last month, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Moscow’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.The Kremlin has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military alliance. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

His government, however, is skeptical that meeting him in person in Kiev would be advisable at this moment, the newspaper said.“If you set aside the security concerns, which are considerable, the question is whether there is anything additional you could achieve by visiting in person, or whether it would just be a show of solidarity, and whether that is a sufficient goal in itself,” the source was quoted as saying.The city has been living in a state of constant emergency since the first days of Russia’s military offensive, which was launched in late February. There are Russian troops close to the Ukrainian capital, with regular reports of damage done to various parts of the city.Ukrainian officials claim Russia is deliberately targeting civilian facilities on a regular basis to terrorize the population. Moscow claims it only strikes military targets and that civilian sites are damaged by Russian fire only when the Ukrainian military deploys their forces near them.The three European prime ministers, Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic, Janez Jansa of Slovenia, and Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland, met Zelensky last Tuesday. The gesture of solidarity appeared to serve a secondary objective of confirming that the Ukrainian president has remained in Kiev, disproving speculation that his daily video appearances were somehow being falsified.Britain has been one of the most vocal supporters of Ukraine both before and during the ongoing security crisis. Last week, Johnson had Zelensky speak to the heads of NATO allies from Nordic and Baltic nations, who had gathered in London for an event. Before that, the Ukrainian leader received a standing ovation after a televised address to the British Parliament.Johnson had less success with an attempt to latch his party’s policies to Ukraine’s fight against Russia. He was criticized by many public figures for drawing parallels last Saturday between the Ukrainian resistance and Britain parting ways with the EU – “choosing freedom,” in his words."

The Russian position must nonetheless be taken into consideration, he stressed.“The Russian case must be heard, one way or the other,” Kalin stated.NATO member Turkey has been striving to take a neutral stance in the ongoing conflict, and is purportedly seeking to act as a mediator between Moscow and Kiev. Unlike other members of the US-led bloc, Ankara has refused to impose economic sanctions against Russia and has kept open its diplomatic channels with both sides.It has also explicitly refused to supply its Russian-made S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems to prop up the Ukrainian military. While the potential transfer – apparently in return for Washington supplying F-35 fighter jets and American-made anti-aircraft systems – has been widely reported by western media, top Turkish officials have said it was not on the table.“This is a done deal for us. They are our property, serving our defense, so it’s over,” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said earlier this week.Ankara has closed the Turkish Sea straits, which connect the Black Sea with the Mediterranean and the Aegean, citing the provisions of the 1936 Montreux Convention. Under the agreement, it is able to close the straits to military vessels of any nation in a state of war, as well as when it perceives itself to be under imminent attack. Neither Russia nor Ukraine has formally declared war, however.Russian launched its offensive against Ukraine on February 24, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

Late last year, the president declared that the US is “committed” to defending Taiwan from any potential Chinese attack, in what appeared to be a break with a long-standing policy of ‘strategic ambiguity.’ White House officials soon walked back his comments, however. The United States has also approved a number of arms sales to Taiwan in recent months, and continues to sail warships through the contested Taiwan Strait on a near-monthly basis despite repeated warnings from Beijing to stay out of its “internal affairs.” China considers Taiwan to be its sovereign territory, though the island has long been self-governed and refers to itself as the Republic of China.Founded as a non-profit corporation, the American Institute in Taiwan now serves as the informal US embassy and has received most of its funding from the State Department since the United States ended diplomatic recognition of Taipei with the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. Currently, only a handful of nations recognize Taiwan as a sovereign country, among them Guatemala, Honduras, Haiti and the Vatican City."

Peskov's comments follow remarks made by President Biden on Monday warning that Russian cyberattacks were probably imminent. ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential and it's coming,"" Biden said, speaking at a business event in Washington, DC on Monday. Citing the ""unprecedented economic costs"" that the US and its allies have imposed on Russia over its military operation in Ukraine, the president suggested that ""the more Putin's back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ,"" and that ""one of the tools he's most likely to use in my view, in our view, is cyberattacks."" Biden cited ""evolving intelligence"" suggesting that Russia was ""exploring options for potential cyberattacks,"" and called on the private sector, including companies operating critical infrastructure, to ""harden your cyber defence immediately."" Biden's deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, Anne Neuberger, told reporters later Monday that the US has no actual evidence about any specific cyber threat from Russia, and declined to name which sectors were at risk. However, she did say that ""some preparatory activity"" by malicious actors was taking place, but did not elaborate. The United States and its allies have spent years accusing Russia of planning or engaging in a broad range of criminal activities online, including the hacking of both commercial organisations and government institutions and even attempts to rig elections. Russian officials have consistently dismissed allegations of involvement in a state-backed cyberwar against the US for lack of concrete evidence, and have criticised America's decision to turn down Russian proposals for cooperation against cybercrime. While accusing Russia and countries such as Iran, China and North Korea of harbouring malevolent cyber intentions, the Biden administration has remained largely silent on the state-sanctioned cyber crimes of allies such as Israel.

The Ukrainian authorities consider access from Russia to be a breach of immigration rules. According to the document called General License 25, news reporting organizations and their employees, considered to be US persons, are allowed to engage in transactions deemed “necessary to their journalistic activities” in the areas concerned, the Treasury said. Media organizations can remunerate their American and local staff, lease office space, pay for cell phones and satellite uplinks and news feeds, honor any sales or employment taxes involved, and even purchase necessary equipment, so long as it’s taken back to the US or another country when it’s no longer needed, the Treasury memo said.The conditions apply to the “Crimea region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) or Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) regions of Ukraine, or such other regions of Ukraine as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury,” according to the memo.Though the US considers all three Ukrainian territory,  Crimea rejoined Russia in 2014, while Moscow recognized the Donbass republics as independent in February.In further general license memos, the US also allowed transactions “necessary for the activities of diplomatic missions of third countries located in the Russian Federation” and extended the deadline for wrapping up transactions related to imports of seafood from Russia until June 23.The US and its NATO allies embargoed Russia after Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.

The site was destroyed overnight in a missile strike, which the Ukrainian authorities described as an indiscriminate bombing of a civilian target.“On March 21, during the night, a high-precision long-distance weapon was used to destroy a battery of Ukrainian multiple rocket launcher artillery and the base where they stored ammunition in a defunct shopping center,” Major General Igor Konashenkov told reporters.The Russian military spokesman added that Ukrainian troops had been using the Vinogradar neighborhood as a base for their operations, showing surveillance footage to that effect. The video ends with what looks like a single missile striking the site.The Retroville shopping center, situated between the Vinogradar and Podolsk neighborhoods on the northwestern side of Kiev, was struck during the night. Ukraine’s emergency services reported on Monday that rescuers had recovered eight bodies from the scene.A nine-story building – the tallest of several on the site – was heavily damaged by the blast and subsequent fire, which was only extinguished at around midday on Monday. The general area was devastated, according to images of the aftermath. Windows in residential buildings hundreds of meters away were reportedly shattered by the shockwave.The office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general said the attack had been conducted by Russia in clear violation of the rules of war and would be investigated as a premeditated mass murder.Before Moscow showed the drone footage, there was widespread speculation online that Russia might have launched the attack after seeing videos on Ukrainian social media showing the launchers at Retroville.Several Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok users had posted images and videos of the rocket artillery being operatied in the area, and even parked up in what looked like a garage or an underpass between two parking lots.RT could not immediately verify whether the footage was authentic or had been manipulated. The individual behind one of the Facebook accounts that had made the connection between the photos and the strike apologized for having shared their post and subsequently deleted it, after others accused them of being a Russian propagandist spreading fake news to justify the attack.#Ukraine: The ""Sport Life"" gym outside the Retroville shopping mall in #Kyiv was hit by a RF missile.

General Eric Vidaud was fired just seven months after getting the job, allegedly for being blindsided by Russia’s attack on Ukraine.Vidaud was appointed military intelligence chief last summer. He previously headed the French Special Operations Command (COS) and was credited with the killing of the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in June 2020.According to French media, the general’s short tenure at the helm of military intelligence was ended by the mismanagement of the Ukraine crisis and the government’s intention to drastically reorganize the agency in the wake of Russia’s attack on the country, last month.The termination was first reported by the newspaper L’Opinion and later covered by other outlets, including state-backed Agence France-Presse (AFP). They cited sources familiar with the situation.According to AFP, rumors about Vidaud’s imminent resignation were circulating in the French military for several days. Some expected him to receive another high-ranking position, but apparently the general will not have that option.Earlier this month, the chief of staff of the French Army, General Thierry Burkhard, told Le Monde that French intelligence failed to predict Russia’s military operation, unlike their American counterparts.One source cited by AFP suggested that sacking the DRM chief over Ukraine was not particularly reasonable, because the agency’s job is to assess military capabilities, not the intentions of foreign governments – and the agency correctly said Russia had the means to attack Ukraine.“We can’t boil this change of leadership down to the Ukrainian situation alone. It is also about reorganizing the service,” the source said.The news agency said the Ukraine crisis is making the French government rethink how it treats military intelligence. It will likely have a more prominent role as a geopolitical tool in the future, so relevant reforms are required in the agency supplying it, according to an expert cited by AFP."

This did not result in any diplomatic breakthrough, but still became the most high-profile meeting between officials from the two Pacific rivals in almost two years.During his meetings with private-sector representatives in recent weeks, the ambassador relayed a message to the Australian authorities from Chinese President Xi Jinping: “Australia has been treating China like the enemy. Australia has to decide whether it is China’s enemy or China’s friend.”This will likely be a complicated decision for Canberra, considering the recent leak of a draft security deal between China and the Solomon Islands, which could well see Beijing establishing a naval base in the Oceania region. Morrison said the development was of “great concern across the Pacific family.”Australia maintains strong influence in the Solomon Islands, providing it with financial aid and security. The Australian military and police are set to remain in the country until December 2023 after being deployed there in 2019 to help quell riots that were provoked by the local government’s decision to switch diplomatic ties from Taiwan to Beijing.Canberra also recently slammed Beijing for its “chilling silence” regarding the Russian military operation in Ukraine and its refusal to introduce any sort of sanctions against Moscow.Meanwhile, China has been angered by Australia’s participation in the AUKUS deal with the US and the UK, which was announced last year and is aimed at arming Canberra with a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.Relations between the two countries took a turn for the worse in 2020, deteriorating when Australia called for a global probe into the origins on Covid-19 and how it spread. Beijing, which had been vigorously rejecting attempts to pin the blame for the pandemic on it, responded by banning imports of some Australian products, including coal, barley and lobsters."

I would like to note that such work is prohibited in the United States and is carried out by the military outside of the country,” the official stated.“According to data published in the Bulgarian media, about 20 Ukrainian soldiers died during the experiments in the Kharkov laboratory alone, and another 200 were hospitalized,” Kirillov added, while claiming that “more than four thousand people” were involved in the testing in Ukraine.The official presented a document, purportedly sent by a Ukrainian military attaché in the US to the country’s defense ministry in April last year. The document highlights a meeting between the attaché and representatives of the US-Canadian company Skymount, which is involved in AI-related research.According to the document, the company demonstrated to the Ukrainian officials its solutions in long-range observation, as well as the Deep Drug AI, a system used for screening and developing drugs. The system “performs the work of 60-person years per day, greatly reducing the manual labor hours to generate new target molecules from existing, pre-approved drugs,” according to its developers.“The received documents confirm an attempt to test previously untested drugs on [the Ukrainian soldiers]. We are talking about the screening system for pharmaceuticals ‘Deep Drug’, which have not passed the licensing procedure in the US and Canada,” Kirillov stated.The particular cynicism of American sponsors lies in the fact that the developer, the Skymount company, offered to purchase the system on a commercial basis, despite the fact that employees of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine were involved as volunteers.Ukraine is not the first country to be used for US military-backed pharmaceutical research, Kirillov noted. In 2010, for instance, Indonesia shut down the US Navy Medical Center in Jakarta, which was apparently involved in a similar project, over “numerous violations,” he added.Moscow raised the allegations of questionable US-sponsored pharmaceutical and biological research taking place in secretive laboratories scattered across Ukraine after it sent troops into the neighboring country late in February. The attack came following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state. Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

Ukrainian presidential aide Mikhail Podolyak said on Thursday that Zelensky could meet Putin “in the coming weeks” but only if a peace treaty was ready.Several rounds of talks between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Belarus have failed to produce breakthroughs, but have led to cooperation on organizing humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians.Last week, the Financial Times reported that “significant” progress had been made in the talks and that a 15-point plan had been drafted. However, the report was refuted by both Moscow and Kiev.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc, while Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied allegations that it was planning to retake the two breakaway regions by force."

The industry resource added that Gazprom only uses the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline, which runs across Russia, Belarus, Poland and Germany, as an extra route to balance deliveries. The long-term contract to use this pipeline expired in May 2020 and was not extended.The main pipeline delivering Russian gas to European consumers is Nord Stream, which runs along the Baltic Sea bed to Germany. Another route is via Ukraine’s gas transit system. However, an auction of extra capacities through Ukraine’s gas transit system was canceled on Monday, as no such capacity was offered by Ukraine.According to energy news site Oilprice.com, Gazprom not booking any space for April on the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline suggests that Russia has no intention to raise its natural gas supply to Europe.The Russian energy giant has been blamed for artificially tightening European gas market by reducing its natural gas exports to the continent at the beginning of this year, compared to the same period in 2021.Gazprom has insisted that it is not to blame for the soaring prices of natural gas, as it fulfils its long-term contract obligations, adding that it has not received requests for additional volumes above contractual thresholds.Gazprom’s figures show that its gas deliveries to Europe in the first two weeks of March were at the highest level since last August.Europe receives 40% of natural gas it needs from Russia but is now seeking to reduce its dependency by sourcing imports from other countries and scaling up renewables. The EU plans to slash demand for Russian imports by two-thirds this year and completely eliminate its dependence on Russian gas before 2030.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

While two of Meta's platforms are affected, its WhatsApp messaging app is allowed to continue to operate in Russia.","The Tverskoy district court in Moscow, Russia has finished reviewing charges against Meta's Facebook and Instagram platforms and ruled to ban both on the territory of Russia over ""extremist activities"". The court stated that the decision will take effect immediately, although Russia’s communications watchdog Roskomnadzor has already started preliminarily blocking the two social media platforms. At the same time, the court order does not affect another Meta product – the messaging platform WhatsApp. The judge explained the decision by the fact that WhatsApp does not have the ability to publicly spread illegal information. The prosecutor in the case against Facebook and Instagram earlier stated that Russian users won't face punishment for continuing to use the services provided by the two platforms, but did not delve into legal details. The prosecution argued that Meta's activities on the two social media platforms were aimed against Russia and its armed forces. Meta's lawyers at the Tverskoy district court said that they had altered their guidelines and banned all forms of Russophobia and calls for discrimination against Russian civilians, as well as calls for killing heads of government. Facebook was banned in Russia already prior to the court's decision due to its repeated acts of censorship against the pages of Russian media outlets. Russia’s Roskomnadzor had issued several warnings to the social media giant over the course of the past two years demanding that it lift the suspensions, but mostly to no avail. "

Record surges in global gas prices have already driven a 54 percent energy price cap rise. After it is raised on 1 April by regulator Ofgem, bills will increase by around £693 ($913), from £1,277 to £1,971 for those on default tariffs paying by direct debit, affecting 22 million customers. The energy price gap is the maximum amount that suppliers can charge customers for each unit of gas and electricity they use. Prepayment customers will see an increase of £708 from £1,309 to £2,017. However, The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in its detailed predictions for the economy warned that the price cap is likely to rise by another 42 per cent in October – a 120 per cent increase on a year earlier. Resulting in skyrocketing costs hitting the nation, it could hike up household energy bills by another £830, with Brits having to fork out an annual sum of close to £3,000. The forecaster also factored in the fallout from the ongoing Russian operation to demiltarise and de-Nazify Ukraine, after the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for help in defending themselves against continued attacks from Kiev forces. In response to what has been labelled “an invasion”, the US and its allies have slapped Moscow with massive sanctions. According to the OBR, inflation was anticipated to reach a 40-year high of 8.7 per cent next winter. It warned that higher inflation would invariably erode real incomes and consumption, slashing GDP growth in 2022 from 6.0 per cent in the October forecast to 3.8 per cent. The independent UK economic forecaster predicted that a racing inflation, “outpacing” nominal earnings, coupled with a net taxes rise in April, would set livings standards plummeting by 2.2 per cent in 2022-23. The watchdog summed up that it would be the largest financial year real living standards fall since records began in 1956. “Despite the £9billion in fiscal support for household energy bills delivered in the Spring Statement, pressure for more could build if the energy price cap in October does rise by the roughly 40 per cent assumed in our central forecast,” concluded ORB. Indeed, the Spring Statement, delivered by UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday, contained an offering of measures by the British government to help people cope with the rising prices. But despite its tax cuts and additional benefits for low-income people, the mini-budget was criticized by some analysts and opposition lawmakers as falling short of what was needed under the circumstances. Sunak, in his speech, announced  that the government would slash 5p off the tax on a litre of gasoline and diesel for a year, promising it would save the average car driver about £2 a week. Furthermore, another £500 million are to be added to the Household Support Fund, distributed by councils to help families on low incomes. Billed as the “largest ever” tax cut , another announcement was the increase in the income threshold that workers must meet before paying National Insurance. The broad tax funds state pensions and some benefits. The Chancellor scrapped a plan to increase the threshold by just £300, replacing it with a “personal tax cut” worth £330 to the average worker, he told MPs. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, this would compensate 70 percent of workers who will be hit by the 1.25 per cent hike in national insurance contributions (NICs) coming into effect next week. Rishi Sunak has also made an offer of zero-VAT rating for green home improvements, such as installation of solar panels and heat pumps, as part of a push to offset reliance on gas. Martin Lewis, who runs the Money Saving Expert website, was cited by The Independent as being frustrated with the Chancellor’s “limited” measure on energy. The OBR also stated that Rishi Sunak’s Spring Statement measures did no more than remove one-sixth of the tax hikes previously announced, with the overall tax take set to reach its highest level since the 1940s. The watchdog added that after a £6 billion cut in national insurance contributions (NICs,) coming into effect in July, and £5 billion reduction in income tax in 2024, the overall tax take will rise from 33 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to 36.3 in 2026-27.

КОТ. Aleksandr (@usykaa)But in an Instagram video post on Friday, Usyk confirmed that he will soon begin training to take on Joshua for a second time.""I decided to start preparing for a rematch with Anthony Joshua, a large number of my friends support me, all the rest of the good and peace, thank God for everything,"" he wrote alongside a video post taken within Ukraine.The 42-second video also detailed the support Usyk said he has received from family and friends in returning to his boxing career.Prior to this, Usyk had been among a number of prominent Ukrainian fighters to have remained in the country throughout Russia's military operation - a list which also includes Vasyl Lomachenko and undefeated MMA champion Yaroslav Amosov.Usyk, who has three young children, is understood to be exempt from a rule which requires all men of a certain age to remain in Ukraine, and has reportedly already left the country to begin his training.His decision to confirm plans for the second Joshua fight comes after the Englishman's promoter, Eddie Hearn, suggested that his fighter might fight someone else should Usyk be unavailable this summer, perhaps for an interim title.Otto Wallin, Luis Ortiz and Joe Joyce were thought to be those being considered to fight Joshua.But Usyk's announcement sets up an opportunity for a summer showdown for the two Olympic gold medalists, with the winner of that in line to potentially face the winner of the forthcoming title fight between Tyson Fury and another Briton, Dillian Whyte."

As to what they will be, that is a matter of our conversations between Ukraine and Russia,” the president added. Earlier in the day, Russia rejected Zelensky’s offer of a direct meeting with President Vladimir Putin, saying the talks had made “no significant progress.”“For us to speak of a meeting between the two presidents, homework has to be done. Talks have to be held and their results agreed upon,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.Russia has also rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying such pauses had been used by Kiev to regroup and launch attacks on its troops.Monday was the first occasion on which Zelensky had raised the idea of a referendum since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine almost a month ago. Back in December, following a call with French President Emmanuel Macron, he said he would “not rule out a referendum” of all Ukrainians regarding the disputed Donbass republics, Crimea, “and maybe, in general, on halting the war” that has been ongoing in the east of the country since 2014.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the two republics. German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

In the second segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Erica Caines, founder of Liberation Through Reading and Editor of Hood Communist Blog to discuss what the red-baiting that is pervasive in debates around critical race theory and what it misses about the reality of CRT, how the debate around CRT obfuscates the desire for Black community control of education, and the history of Black community control over education through small-scale alternative educational programs. In the third segment, Sean and Jacquie discuss the anniversary of the launch of the Associated Negro Press and the importance of the Black radical journalistic tradition today, what lessons the work of the ANP holds for us today in the current age of extreme censorship against anti-war voices, and why alternative media is important to not only present issues that the ruling class actively ignores but also to combat the cynicism promoted by the mainstream media. Later in the show, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Carlos Martinez, author and activist, co-founder of No Cold War, and co-editor of Friends of Socialist China to discuss the non-response of the US government to the COVID-19 pandemic as the US approaches one million deaths from the virus and how it contrasts with China’s response to the pandemic, the consensus of the mainstream media around supporting Ukraine in the war with Russia and how it compares with the representations of previous acts of NATO aggression in Yugoslavia, Iraq, and Libya, and the US effort to couple its cold war drives against China and Russia by making threats against China related to the crisis in Ukraine.

He added that Washington has blacklisted Chinese officials who it said were guilty of human rights violations.Wang responded in kind, calling the US “the biggest human rights violator in the world,” whose historical treatment of Native Americans “constitutes de facto genocide.” He also criticized Washington for the “long-lasting systemic racial discrimination” of black Americans.Multiple global human rights groups have long accused China of oppressing the Uyghurs and forcing them to work in labor camps. Beijing has denied the allegations, insisting that the Uyghurs are studying in vocational education and training centers as part of state integration and deradicalization programs."

No one dies of it. But people are dying elsewhere,” Hauk said, referencing the toll Russia has inflicted on Ukraine.The comments from the politician, who is a member of the Christian Democratic Union party, elicited a strong response from the German Tenants’ Association, which retorted that it showed no understanding of the needs of the elderly or those working from home.Although the association conceded that Europe needed to reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels, it warned that lowering the room temperature and relying instead on wearing more clothing could lead to people falling ill during the winter months. “With a ministerial salary or a presidential pension, you can afford exploding energy costs and do not need to freeze yourself,” Stuttgart state chairman Rolf Gassmann said.The association went on to remind Gassmann that, with regard to rented accommodation, German landlords have a legal obligation to ensure rooms can be heated to 22 degrees Celsius and to install proper ventilation to prevent moisture buildup and mold infestation.The European Union is to phase out its reliance on oil and gas from Russia by 2030, beginning by reducing its demand for Russian gas by two-thirds this year. The region “cannot rely on a supplier who explicitly threatens us,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said."

","Poland has blocked the Russian Embassy's bank accounts under the pretext of 'terrorism financing,' according to the Russian Ambassador to Poland Sergei Andreyev.  The envoy to Poland, appearing on Russian television, said that the accounts had been frozen since the end of February, in a step by the Polish authorities that violates the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. “It is probably clear to any sane person that the accusations regarding diplomatic representation are more than absurd, not to mention the fact that there is a direct and blatant violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” Andreev added. This comes after the previous day Poland announced it was expelling 45 Russian diplomats over alleged espionage. Sergey Andreyev slammed the decision as unfounded. Furthermore, Poland does not rule out the expulsion of Russian Ambassador to Warsaw Sergey Andreyev, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz said on Thursday, noting that the decision has not been made yet. After Warsaw ordered 45 Russian diplomats out of the country, Moscow pledged to respond to the move, while Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman, told the Rossiya 24 broadcaster that the number of diplomats Poland wants to expel is ""unprecedented."" Poland's move came as part of the swathe of sanctions that Washington, its European and NATO allies have targeted at Russiaover its special operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine after the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for help in defending themselves against continued attacks from Kiev forces.  Moscow has reiterated that the aim of its special operation is to exclusively target military infrastructure, with the Kremlin having no plans to occupy Ukraine. However, in response to what has been labelled “an invasion”, the US and its allies have been funneling military assistance to Ukraine and unleashing a sanctions campaign, fallout from which has already been felt by the West itself.

( @Nathan_Gissing ) pic.twitter.com/aa3chqzc15Joining Boehly and his partners on the shortlist is the group headed by ex-British Airways and Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton, who has been endorsed by World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe. They are backed by Crystal Palace shareholders Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who owns NBA franchise the Philadelphia 76ers, but the pair will have to end their association with Palace if they are chosen to take over Chelsea.Additionally, financial reserves will be offered by the Creative Arts Agency which has football agency Base and Evolution Media Capital in its portfolio.The Chicago Cubs-owning Ricketts family still hold out hopes of making the shortlist amid a social media backlash caused by previous Islamophobic comments made by its patriarch Joe.""Muslims are naturally my (our) enemy due to their deep antagonism and bias against non-Muslims,"" Ricketts wrote in a widely-circled email, with the Ricketts family since stressing that they reject ""any form of hate in the strongest possible terms"" amid potential protests from Muslim players such as Hakim Ziyech, Antonio Rudiger, N'Golo Kante and Malang Sarr if they buy the club.The Saudi Media Group, though, who were said to have bid $3.5 billion, are already known to have been knocked back by Raine – which according to ESPN are whittling down the list of preferred bidders after receiving 20 to 30 offers.Raine will reportedly take their preferred offers to Chelsea and Abramovich for a number one choice to be selected, which will then undergo the Premier League's owners' and directors' test. Once that has been passed, the UK government will be asked to give their green light to a sale and provide a license for the club to officially end Abramovich's 21-trophy dynasty at the west London club. Simultaneously, however, ESPN says that sources told them Raine will identify two or three bids for consideration by Chelsea's hierarchy with Abramovich excluded from the process.As per The Sun on Friday afternoon, the bids from Boehly and Broughton are now in a two-horse race to assume the reins at the reigning world and European champions."

The EU imported $108 billion in energy from Russia in 2021, with these supplies accounting for about 62 percent of the region’s total consumption.","The Biden administration does not have the authority to force US energy producers to trade with European customers, and the EU’s ambitious push to slash imports from Russia is not considered realistic, people who are said to be familiar with the situation have told Politico. Late last year, as spot prices for natural gas were soaring, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that US deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe had dropped, in spite of months of US “concerns” about the price crunch being suffered by the region. Russia, Putin said, had increased its gas sales to Europe by 15 percent, and enjoys a competitive advantage against LNG in both pricing and carbon footprint. Russia delivered some 155 billion cubic meters of gas to Europe in 2021, with these supplies accounting for more than 45 percent of total European imports of the fuel. The region’s reliance on Russian supplies has grown by over 25 percent over the past decade, notwithstanding a US-led effort to sabotage this trade using sanctions and diplomatic pressure to get European countries to buy more US-sourced LNG. Energy analysts cited by Politico said the two-thirds cut in Russian supplies recently proposed by Brussels “isn’t realistic”, with a 50 to 60 percent reduction possible if a “wartime effort” were undertaken, with those efforts expected to affect the global LNG market with price shocks. An unnamed EU energy official said the bloc’s requests would be ""tough to meet"". Another source called EU requests to date ""vague"", and suggested the EU remain wary of importing polluting US gas derived from fracking. Of America's LNG capacity, 80 percent is already slated for Europe, S&amp;P Global analyst Ross Wyeno said. No additional capacity is expected to be made available until at least 2024. The crisis in Ukraine has prompted America’s European allies to pledge that they would dramatically reduce purchases of Russian energy, and Washington has instituted a total ban on oil and gas supplies from Russia earlier this month. “We’re moving forward with this ban understanding that many of our European partners and allies may not be in a position to join us,” President Biden said in a speech announcing the ban. The United States has not imported any Russian gas since 2019, and Russian oil accounted for only about one percent of total US consumption in 2021. The absence of Russian supplies has nevertheless had an apparent psychological impact on US energy prices, with gasoline hitting an all-time record of $4.33 per gallon on 11 March before dropping to $4.27 as of Friday. Biden is expected to bring up energy during his visit to Brussels on Thursday for a meeting of the European Council and to attend an emergency NATO summit. Russian officials and energy companies have announced readiness to continue supplying energy to Europe and other clients in accordance with existing contracts and said Moscow is prepared to reach new agreements. Supplies have continued to flow west, including through Ukraine, notwithstanding the ongoing Russian military operation in that country. Last month, Russia agreed a new 30-year 10 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas per year contract to supply gas to China using a new pipeline. The infrastructure expected to be built within two to three years. Russia already sells natural gas to China using both the Power of Siberia pipeline and LNG deliveries. The People’s Republic purchased 16.5 billion bcm of Russian gas in 2021. "

Lugansk, as well as Donetsk, proclaimed its independence in 2014, after a violent coup d'etat in Kiev.

As a result of the eight-year-long war in Donbass, over 13,000 people were killed. In February 2022, intensifying shelling by Kiev's troops resulted in mass evacuations from the DPR and LPR. Both republics appealed to Russia, asking for help, and Moscow launched a special operation in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin stressed it was started to stop the genocide perpetrated by Kiev's troops, and noted that the goal of the op is the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine.

ee04ee83-5774-4c10-b10a-6fb6ea431f7c,https://www.rt.com/news/552626-ukraine-conflict-living-standard/,Western elites are exploiting the Ukraine conflict to lower the standard of living,https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.03/xxs/623c7ecd2030270dfd7a0cf4.jpg,It seems to be a continuation of the trend where you must sacrifice for the greater global good or be ostracized by the thought police,"It’s impossible to escape the constant undertone of the need to sacrifice for the greater global good or else be viewed as a selfish prick. And now, you risk even worse branding by the thought police if you don’t fall in line with this new outlook: That of a Putin-enabler.  Since Russia launched its military campaign in Ukraine, Western elites have been arguing that we all must collectively and senselessly concede to lowering our basic standards of living in order to hit back at President Vladimir Putin. In reality, all it does is allow them to continue to profit from our increasingly lowered expectations while all we get in return is the satisfaction of our own virtue signaling. French Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire called on all the French to “make an effort” on their energy consumption to cope with the rising prices. People should “realize that we’re entering into a new world” amid the conflict in Ukraine, in which we “must accelerate our independence vis-à-vis fossil fuel,” he said in an interview with the news channel BFMTV earlier in March.  Meanwhile, France’s ecological transition minister, Barbara Pompili, announced that public institutions would be asked to “reduce by one degree” their heating in response to the spike in energy prices since the onset of the conflict. Le Maire let the cat out of the bag in evoking a “new world” – a phrase which seems to be on the lips of top western officials these days, including US President Joe Biden earlier this week at a business round table. “Now is a time when things are shifting and there’s going to be a new world order out there, and we’ve got to lead it,” Biden said. “We’ve got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.”And chief EU diplomat Josep Borrell has also asked Europeans to “cut the umbilical cord that connects with Russia,” by using less heating, apparently unaware that it could potentially be redirected to other markets while Europeans sit around waiting for their newfound beaming virtue to generate heat. There has long been American pressure on Europe to cut itself off from Russian gas. The hostility towards the needs of the average citizen living within the European Union has been framed as looking out for their best interests against Russia. The “Protecting Europe’s Energy Security Act of 2019” was designed to sanction corporations involved in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline construction to “address Russian pipeline projects that create risks to U.S. national security, threaten Europe’s energy security, and consequently, endanger Europe’s political and economic welfare.” Not surprisingly, the legislation was introduced by Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from “big oil” Texas, which could eventually profit from the EU losing Russia as its supplier. According to US government data, in 2021, the EU was buying about 2.3 million barrels a day of Russian crude oil and condensate – or 49 % of the country’s exports.The problem is that there are no immediate practical substitutions for Russian energy. And while turning down “Putin’s gas” in your French home may be appropriate in any case – and I speak as someone who has never once turned on the heat in my home in 13 years of French living – there’s something else going on here. It seems like politicians are exploiting the current situation to condition people to accept paying more while accepting less value, and with no real end or practical solution in sight. The fact that Le Maire manipulatively played on emotions by evoking images of Ukrainian children in an appeal for basic energy conservation should raise red flags.Likewise, German Agriculture Minister Cem Ozdemir told Spiegel magazine that people should fight Putin by changing their diet. “Despite the fact that I am a vegetarian, I will not preach that everyone should go vegetarian,” he said. “But let’s put it this way: Eating less meat would be a contribution against Putin.”This message is brought to us by the same elites who routinely peddle the idea of westerners eating bugs in mainstream media. Ozedemir’s request has nothing to do with Putin or Ukraine and everything to do with this obsession of relentlessly guilting the average person into complying with, and pressuring one another into, lowering their own living standards under the pretext of fighting climate change, or Putin, or whatever other cockamamie excuse they think you’ll accept.Meanwhile, Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder, climate change fighter, and relentless vaccine peddler, has become the largest private farmland owner in the United States and is set up to be one of the big beneficiaries of a meatless future. Particularly when considering that Gates has openly supported genetically modified food production, while the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has invested millions into the genetically modified food company, Monsanto, according to NBC News. Other Silicon Valley billionaires are also investing in fake food production, including PayPal founder Peter Thiel and Google co-founder Sergey Brin.This makes one wonder if it’s really about sticking it to Putin and not about the wealthy trying to convince you to advocate against your own best interests. Not even your sacred pets are safe. A Bloomberg News opinion piece suggested recently that people should cut corners on the health of their companion animals in this period of crisis-provoked inflation. “If you’re one of the many Americans who became a new pet owner during the pandemic, you might want to rethink those costly pet medical needs,” the piece stated.Another op-ed in France’s Liberation newspaper asks: “How far are we prepared to go in economic sanctions against Russia and what they mean in our daily lives?” It’s impossible to escape the constant undertone of the need to sacrifice for the greater global good or else be viewed as a selfish prick. And now, you risk even worse branding by the thought police if you don’t fall in line with this new outlook: That of a Putin-enabler. At this rate, we’ll soon be at the point where if you aren’t living at the same standard as a Ukrainian refugee, then you’re an earth-killing, gas-guzzling, democracy-hating glutton who has no business participating in polite society. If you think that it can’t happen, just ask any of those who were shunned and marginalized without pity, losing their jobs, lifestyle, or freedom of travel amid the Covid crisis when they refused to get vaccinated in order to obtain the coveted digital health pass.Western elites are exploiting this crisis to accelerate a long articulated agenda that seems destined to lead to collective impoverishment to the benefit of a select few. They point and scream at Russia, advancing their pawns and scapegoats from behind fake virtue. Don’t fall for it. "

But Britain is hooked up to other European countries that do receive Russian gas supplies, including the Netherlands — which exports more than it uses.","A British government minister has claimed the UK imports only three per cent of its natural gas needs from Russia — and that none comes via undersea pipelines. Responding to written parliamentary questions, Business, Energy and Clean Growth Minister Greg Hands said the average annual gas consumption of a British household was roughly 12,200 kilowatt hours (kWh). He added that the UK had imported about 21,506 Gigawatt hours of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) from Russia over the past five years. The MailOnline calculated that meant Russia heats around 1.75 million of Britain's 28 million homes, or 4.2 million people. As part of sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, the British government has vowed to ban Russian oil purchases from 2023 and ""explore"" phasing out gas imports too. Russia has responded by requiring all European Union and NATO member states to pay for its gas in roubles, undermining the value of Western currencies. Hands insisted that ""The UK only receives direct gas in the form of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) from Russia, since there are no gas pipelines directly linking the UK with Russia."" However, the UK's gas network is connected to those of other western European countries including Germany, France and the Netherlands, all of which import gas from Russia. According to number-crunching website Statista, the Netherlands imported 11 per cent of its 36.6 billion cubic metre (m3) gas consumption from Russia in 2020 — but at the same time exported 39.9 billion m3. In 2018 the Netherlands pumped just over 30 gigawatt-hours of gas to the UK, equating to 2.64 billion m3. ""Over the last five years (2017-2021), UK gas imports from Russia accounted for, on average, two per cent of the UK’s gas supply portfolio,"" the minister said. ""On average, over the last five years (2017-2021), the UK received 21506 GWh of LNG from Russia."" Britain reportedly gets around half its gas from its North Sea fields and another third from nearby Norway.  The UK is also home to Europe's largest LNG terminal, the South Hook installation in Milford Haven in south-west Wales. Qatar Energy has a 67.5 per cent majority shareholding in the facility, with ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies having 24.15 per cent and 8.35 Per cent respectively. South Hook and the nearby Dragon terminal can potentially handle a quarter of UK gas consumption.   Qatar, one of the world's biggest exporters of natural gas from its Persian Gulf fields, has said it cannot replace Europe's Russian gas imports in the short term. "

""If it is an existential threat for our country, then it can be used in accordance with our concept."" Peskov stated that the Kremlin did not want to believe that no one would listen to its concerns until the very last moment. According to him, the Putin administration hoped that Ukraine would not prepare for strikes against the Donbass, and hoped that there would be a breakthrough in the Normandy format, but it became absolutely clear to Moscow that Kiev would go on the offensive against the Donbass. The Kremlin spokesman reiterated that the Russian military does not strike civilian targets, and the purpose of the special military operation is not the ""occupation of Ukraine."" Peskov added that the special military operation in Ukraine is going exactly according to plan, noting that no one at the Kremlin initially thought that the special military operation would take a couple of days, as this is what was described as a serious operation with serious goals. Peskov also refuted claims that Russian President Vladimir Putin is angry with Ukrainians. He noted, however, that Putin is angry with people in Ukraine who want their country to become a NATO member and potentially deploy American missiles. Peskov also suggested that the Russian president is angry with those who would forbid the use of the Russian language, and who wanted to participate in the Minsk negotiation process for years without fulfilling obligations. Peskov was responding to a CNN journalist saying that some experts believe that Putin may be angry with Ukrainians. She also cited Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, who, she suggested, spoke of Putin's ""growing hatred"" for Ukrainian leadership and the nation’s citizens. Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine on February 24. Putin at the time said its goal was ""the protection of people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years."" The Russian president additionally asserted that a demilitarization and ""denazification"" of Ukraine must be performed to bring to justice war criminals responsible for ""bloody crimes against civilians"" in Donbass. Later, the Russian Ministry of Defense added that the army is only targetting military infrastructure and Ukrainian troops, along with neo-Nazi militias. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

The Bank of Russia suggested earlier this year that cryptocurrency mining should be banned, citing possible risks for the country’s economy.Sanctions imposed on Russia following its military operation in Ukraine have cut the country off from the Western financial system, frozen its assets abroad, and banned imports of dollar- and euro-denominated currency into the country. This has forced Moscow to find alternative currencies for trade with its partners.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

According to the United Nations, more than 3.2 million people have fled Ukraine since the operation began.","The United Kingdom’s programme for helping refugees has descended into chaos as people launch bidding wars on social media boasting about their homes, The Telegraph has reported. According to the newspaper, users on Facebook are competing against each other, bragging about the size of their houses, bedrooms, as well as leisure facilities located nearby. Another family offered ""two double bedrooms and a large private bathroom” as well as ""a room with a king-size bed"" in a house ""next to the beach"".Ukrainian refugees are said to have received 300 posts each with Brits offering them to stay in their houses. The Telegraph writes that 147,000 people have registered for the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Sources told the newspaper that this amounted to more than 400,000 rooms. A couple who spoke to the outlet said they had to abandon their plans to offer accommodation to Ukrainians in the face of intense competition. The couple’s frustration has been echoed by charity organisations, which said that the authorities must immediately take charge of the process instead of leaving it to the public.""With multiple Facebook sites now available, there is a risk of the process getting out of control and becoming a free-for-all. It’s vital the Government now steps in and has oversight of the matching process"", said Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council.Robina Qureshi, the director of Positive Action in Housing which runs Room for Refugees, said the government’s system is an ""inadequate replacement for a safe, screened, risk-assessed hosting process"". Lord Richard Harrington, UK minister for refugees, said the first Ukrainians under the government scheme would start arriving in Britain early next week. He said the government has no idea how many people would enter the country.Under the programme, residents of Britain have to offer accommodation for at least six months. The government will provide ""a substantial level of funding to local authorities to enable them to provide much wider support to families to rebuild their lives and fully integrate into our communities"". Under this scheme, people will have access to public services, work, and benefits.Authorities are offering an optional ""thank you"" payment of £350 per month to people who can accommodate one or more household. It is limited to one payment per residential address. Since 24 February, Russia has been conducting a special operation in Ukraine, which President Vladimir Putin said is meant to de-Nazify and demilitarise Kiev as well as protect the residents of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics from the genocide waged against them by Ukraine's leadership. Western nations have thrown their support behind Ukraine and condemned Russia's actions, also slapping the harshest sanctions on Moscow to date, triggering an unprecedented stand-off with the Kremlin.According to the United Nations, more than 3.2 million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the operation.

A growing number are considering breaking ties with the monarchy altogether, as fellow Caribbean island nation Barbados did last year, and sources tell UK media the process of separation may be underway already.The island nation is already in the process of removing the Queen as head of state, according to sources cited by The Independent, which claimed a “senior figure within the government” had been tasked with transitioning Jamaica to a republic.Hundreds of protesters gathered to meet the royal couple outside the British High Commission building on Tuesday, and an open letter from a coalition of Jamaican politicians, business leaders, musicians, and other professionals calling itself the Advocates Network was handed over to the High Commission as well. The missive listed 60 reasons why the British monarchy should compensate Jamaica to celebrate its 60 years of independence, and reparations were front and center.The group aren’t just seeking money – they want “economic social reparation,” like “building us proper hospitals, providing and making sure that our children are educated through college level, and making sure land is equally distributed,” human rights advocate Opal Adisa, a signatory to the letter, said, adding that an apology would be merely the “first step towards healing and reconciliation.”However, the Advocates Network have clearly had enough of waiting.“We see no reason to celebrate 70 years of the ascension of your grandmother to the British throne because her leadership, and that of her predecessors, have perpetuated the greatest human rights tragedy in the history of humankind,” the letter reads, calling for “an apology for British crimes against humanity, including but not limited to, the exploitation of the indigenous people of Jamaica, the transatlantic trafficking of Africans, the enslavement of Africans, indentureship and colonisation.”Culture Minister Olivia ‘Babsy’ Grange addressed members of the Reparations Council on Saturday, calling for them to “step up the pace” on developing a “roadmap to reparation.” Even the opposition party reportedly agrees that the monarchy should atone for the horrors of slavery, though not everyone is on board with the idea of ‘divorcing’ from the monarchy.Jamaica became a British colony in 1665, and over 3 million African slaves were trafficked through the transatlantic network of which the island was a major hub before slavery was abolished in the colony in 1838.While Britain finally paid off the descendants of slave owners for the loss of ‘property’ they endured when their slaves became free human beings in 2015, paying reparations to the descendants of their former property has proved less popular.Former PM David Cameron, whose family profited from the slave trade, was asked for reparations in 2015 when he became the first British PM to visit Jamaica in 14 years, but he rejected the idea.The royal tour, set to coincide with the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee marking 70 years on the throne, has been repeatedly described by the UK press as a “charm offensive,” with some experts suggesting it is an attempt to prevent a “domino effect” following last year’s departure of Barbados from the British Commonwealth.Thus far it seems to have proven more “offensive” than “charming,” with the royal couple chased off their first appointment during their visit to Belize, after protesters objected to their attempted use of “stolen” communal land. A later speech about Ukraine and the importance of “freedoms” came off tone-deaf at best given the context, and the royals will be lucky to escape Jamaica with the Commonwealth intact. The pair are set to visit the Bahamas next. "

On Friday, US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a nearly two-hour video meeting to discuss the conflict, as well as their bilateral relations.  The talks do not appear to have produced a substantive change in the position of either side, with the White House readout of the call evidencing that the US is continuing to allude to taking action against China but also, unusually, that Biden referenced Taiwan. The US president warned Beijing that there would be “implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia.” In response, President Xi said China has always stood for “peace, and opposes war.” “All sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace,” he stressed, adding that NATO and the US should also engage in talks with Moscow. This was the first known discussion between the American and Chinese leaders since November. It followed a meeting at the beginning of the week in Rome between US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and China’s leading diplomat, Yang Jiechi. The US has made it clear that it will impose “costs” on Beijing if it is deemed to be “supporting” Russia. Earlier this week, several Western media outlets claimed Moscow had asked Beijing “for equipment and other kinds of unspecified military assistance” to aid its offensive in Ukraine. Beijing has dismissed the allegations, with the spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, saying of Russia’s alleged request that China “had never heard of that,” and adding that his country’s priority was “to prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control.” It’s likely the allegation was designed to both embarrass Beijing and further promulgate the narrative that Russia’s war effort is failing.China is a cautious geopolitical player. It has a foreign policy premised on seeking stability and prioritizing its own economic development. Because of that, it does not and will not openly support the war in Ukraine. However, these concerns don’t mean Xi Jinping is going to jump into America’s arms and confront Moscow. While China undoubtedly wishes for a peaceful resolution, it owes the United States nothing, and it recognizes that turning against Russia would involve exchanging long-term strategic considerations for short-term certainties. After all, once the crisis in Ukraine is over, it will be full steam ahead for the US’ Indo-Pacific strategy and business as usual when it comes to its containment of Beijing.Last month, just before the opening of the Winter Olympics, Vladimir Putin met with Xi Jinping and sealed a “no limits” friendship between their two countries, affirming a joint vision for a multipolar world. The Russia-China partnership has strengthened considerably in recent years, each nation having faced the common strategic enmity of the US and its allies, with Washington long seeking to contain both in the pursuit of unipolar hegemony and to crush all of its competitors along the way. Moscow and Beijing have differing interests in a number of respective areas, but a consensus forged on the premise that they provide each other political space and act as a counterweight to the US and its alliances, being invested in a multipolar environment.Although Russia’s offensive in Ukraine has distracted Washington from its Indo-Pacific agenda, it has also provoked uncertainty in the markets, allowed the US to increase its clout in the EU, and encouraged Taiwan to exploit the crisis so as to build more political space for itself. China also had a strong trading relationship with Ukraine, which joined its Belt and Road Initiative back in 2017. It’s clear the US is seeking to use the crisis to drive a wedge between Beijing and its allies, and, in its bid to isolate both Russia and China, is aiming to frame Beijing as being complicit in Moscow’s “special operation.” It will no doubt reset its strategic priorities as the war continues. However, for a number of reasons, this is unlikely to change China’s calculus.First, even if Beijing were to explicitly act against Moscow, the US would not change its current course on China as a reward. Beijing therefore has no reason either to trust or barter with Washington. It should not be forgotten that, prior to the Ukraine conflict, the US was effectively accusing China of genocide against the Uighurs, had orchestrated a smear campaign against the Winter Olympics, had blacklisted ever-growing numbers of its companies, had created hostile military blocs such as AUKUS (Australia, the UK, and the US), the Quad (Australia, India, Japan, and the US), and was trying to move the needle on Taiwan. One would be naïve to assume Washington would reverse course on any of this in the vain hope Beijing would turn against Moscow and dump its key strategic partner just to appease the US and its allies.Second, China recognizes that the US views it as its primary threat and competitor, perceiving Russia as having less capacity to compete on a global scale in terms of economics and technology. While Beijing may continue to call for peace and dialogue in Ukraine, it will nonetheless continue to align itself with Moscow when it comes to opposing the expansion of NATO, calling instead for a “balanced, effective, and sustainable security mechanism.” This is in line with its existing position on the creation of US-led alliance blocs targeting nations such as China, and the Cold War mentality that has been evoked as a consequence. China has made no secret of its view that the US is “on the wrong side of history.”In conclusion, while China doesn’t like the uncertainty of the conflict in Ukraine, it owes the US no favors when it comes to the part it will play in restoring stability. Having been intent on waging a Cold War against Beijing, Washington is now attempting to control its response to the Ukrainian crisis while continuing to alternately threaten and coerce it. As a result, when it comes to its strategic partnership with Russia, it has simply dug in its heels. While China and Russia don’t share the same world view, they’ve been brought together by the political currents of the West, which arrogantly believes it can impose its dominance and expand its spheres of influence without consequences. Though China will engage in dialogue with the US, there’s going to be no 21st-century repeat of the Sino-Soviet split, whatever the US might have hoped. "

Its two main options moving forward are either to join NATO or boost the military cooperation with the United States and neighbouring Sweden without joining the alliance, Niinisto was cited as saying.

Last year, the FCC noted five Chinese enterprises as the first to be included on the ""Covered List"" of the US telecom regulator.","The FCC on Friday added Russia's AO Kaspersky Lab, China Telecom (Americas) Corp, and China Mobile International USA to its list of communications equipment and services deemed a threat to US national security. Jessica Rosenworcel, FCC chair, said in the statement on the decision that in March 2021, ""for the first time, the FCC published a list of communications equipment and services that pose an unacceptable risk to national security, and we have been working closely with our national security partners to review and update this list"". The decision means that money from the FCC's $8 billion annual Universal Service Fund (USF) can no longer be used to buy or maintain items from any of the listed corporations, according to the designation. Funds from the USF are, in part, used to help low-income consumers access telecommunication services in rural and high-cost locations, as well as government facilities such as schools, libraries, and healthcare facilities.  FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr welcomed the move, saying that the agency ""plays a critical role in securing our nation’s communications networks, and keeping our Covered List up to date is an important tool we have at our disposal to do just that"". Moscow-based Kaspersky Labs has been under increasing pressure due to the crippling sanctions imposed by many nations across the globe, including in the West, on Russian entities because of the nation's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine.  US officials have long voiced concerns about Kaspersky, Russia's biggest information company. The company's flagship anti-virus programme was banned from federal networks in 2017. European cyber agencies have begun to follow suit, releasing similar cautionary statements and restrictions, according to reports. The FCC voted 4-0 earlier this month to withdraw the authorisation for Chinese telecom Pacific Networks and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ComNet, to provide telecommunications services in the United States. The FCC terminated China Telecom (Americas)'s authorisation in October 2021, claiming the company ""is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government"", and the firm reportedly failed to get the ruling overturned in court.   The agency went on to reject China Mobile's application to install telecommunications services in the United States in 2019, citing national security concerns. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

According to Heikki Porola, chief superintendent at the Helsinki Police Department, the threats began immediately after the launch of Russia's military operation to demilitarise Ukraine, which the West depicts as “occupation”. So far, the threats, delivered via letters and other media, have not resulted in any incidents and no explosives have been found. The police are working with the embassy, located in central Helsinki, to determine whether the threats are credible, but have yet to launch a criminal investigation, national broadcaster Yle reported. However, in recent weeks the embassy has also been the target of vandalism as perpetrators have sprayed graffiti on the fence around the building and broke a security camera attached to one of the gates. Since then, surveillance at the location has been stepped up, with round-the-clock patrols in the area. These incidents have coincided with large-scale demonstrations outside the embassy, according to police. According the police, embassies, especially those belonging to countries seen as superpowers, often receive threats when significant international events occur. The last time the Russian Embassy in Finland was threatened when during Crimea's re-unification with Russia in 2014, which the West largely portrayed as an “invasion”. Following Russia's demilitarisation campaign in Ukraine, anti-Russian sentiment has soared across the Western world, reaching levels unseen since the Cold War era, with numerous reported instances of people getting abused, “cancelled”, discriminated against or persecuted for having Russian roots or sympathies. Among others, the University of Helsinki, one of Finland's premier higher education establishments, was this week bombarded with thousands of anti-Russia comments on its social media channels. The messages urged the university to stop accepting students from Russia and terminate scholarships for Russian citizens. The university has previously stated that it will continue to welcome researchers and students from Russia, yet condemned Russia's special operation. Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, in response to calls for help from the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk amid shelling by Ukrainian forces. The US and its Western allies retaliated by imposing massive sanctions against Russia, with numerous Western companies leaving the country's market in protest and manufacturers and business owners across the globe pulling Russian or Russian-associated products as a token of their condemnation and solidarity.

The Chinese Embassy spokesperson also noted that on 24 March 1999, NATO bombed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, ""causing thousands of casualties"", including some Chinese citizens, and displacing hundreds of thousands. ""The lessons of history must not be forgotten"", the mission said. On Thursday, NATO condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine as a ""threat"" to global security, with the Kremlin calling it ""escalatory rhetoric [...] irresponsible and destabilising"". NATO has called on ""all states"", including China, to ""uphold the international order including the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity"", and refrain from supporting Russia in any way, and to refrain from taking any action that aids Moscow in evading sanctions. NATO also said that the Xi administration's public statements have ""alarmed"" the bloc, while urging Beijing not to support what it said were Russia's ""false narratives...in particular on the war and on NATO"". China has consistently replied to accusations from the West that it is supporting the Russian government by respecting international law and Ukraine's sovereignty, but adding that the security concerns that Russia claimed sparked the crisis must not be overlooked. The statement from the embassy reaffirmed that position, as well as Beijing's demand for a ceasefire and an end to the special military operation. In February, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the goal of the special military operation in Ukraine ""the protection of people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years"". According to Putin, a ""demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine"" must be carried out so as to bring to justice war criminals responsible for the ""bloody crimes against civilians"" in Donbass.

Western media began reporting the rumor after the US and EU authorities hinted of possible sanctions targeting Russian gold.“All the gold from our gold and foreign exchange reserves is in the vaults of the Bank of Russia on the territory of our country,” the regulator stated on its website.The central bank explained that gold and foreign exchange reserves are a tool with which the regulator can protect the country's economy from external threats. In particular, they can become a source of funds to cover the cost of foreign exchange debt, stabilize the foreign exchange market and help pay for critical imports.Earlier this month, the US and its allies froze roughly half of Russia’s reserves, worth $300 billion, as part of sanctions over Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine. However, the remainder of the country’s reserves, which includes physical gold, is secure, according to the Bank of Russia.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

The plants were originally supposed to be phased out by 2025 under a plan proposed nearly two decades ago.“Everyone knows there is a war in Europe… we choose certainty in uncertain times,” PM Alexander De Croo told a press conference on Friday, alluding to the Russian origin of most of Europe’s natural gas supplies. After Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine, the EU announced plans to cut dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year, with a view to ending its reliance on the fuel entirely by 2030.Under the original plan, proposed in 2003, Belgium was supposed to build a gas-powered plant north of Brussels and shut down its French-operated nuclear reactors Doel 4 and Tihange 3 by 2025. The lifespan of the two reactors, which came online in 1985, “can be extended by 10 years,” De Croo announced in his address.The PM also declared the country would speed up its transition to renewable energy, though he did not specify what kind of energy. Tihange and Doel, which together comprise 35% of the country’s nuclear energy capacity, are located in eastern Belgium and the Antwerp area and generate 1,038 and 1,039 megawatts, respectively.Last year, Belgium’s government confirmed it would shut down all the country’s nuclear plants over the subsequent three years. However, at the time, the country planned to investigate other forms of nuclear energy with an eye toward possibly opening smaller nuclear plants.Specifically, the government was interested in smaller modular reactors which, while generating less power than their larger brethren, are also less likely to cause catastrophic meltdowns, with any potential failures being easier to contain.Belgium’s two nuclear plants contain a total of seven reactors, all operated by French utility firm Engie. While neighboring France considers nuclear power to be “green” and derives 70% of its energy from nuclear plants, fellow neighbor Germany does not and initially planned to shut down all its nuclear plants by the end of 2022 under a deal inked in the aftermath of Japan’s Fukushima disaster.However, as the EU squirms between the need for imported natural gas and the perceived necessity of punishing Moscow with sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, Berlin is reconsidering shutting down its nuclear plants. Three such plants remain in operation, with the country’s economic ministers having called for a reconsideration of the shutdown plans. But the phaseout has progressed to such an extent that, even if the government opts to keep the nuclear plants operational, it will require another 18 months before they can return to functionality, with a shortage of trained personnel and a difficulty in obtaining the necessary fuel rods meaning the plants must shut down at least temporarily until the winter of 2023-2024. The fate of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was supposed to carry Russian natural gas directly to Germany, remains unknown, but it is unlikely to become operational under the current array of sanctions."

Agency head Krzysztof Waclawek has requested the Foreign Ministry to declare them persona non grata, the statement said.The ISA said it had collected evidence of the suspects’ clandestine activities. One of them is associated with a Polish citizen arrested on March 17 on suspicion of espionage for Russia.The looming expulsion of such a large number of diplomats is “due to Russia’s policy towards the Republic of Poland and its allies” and the Russian attack against Ukraine, the statement said.The Russian diplomatic service confirmed that its ambassador in Warsaw, Sergey Andreev, was summoned by the Polish Foreign Ministry on Wednesday. Andreev confirmed that he was given a note with the names of 45 Russian diplomats who must leave the country within five days. Moscow will respond to the expulsions with corresponding actions, the Russian Foreign Ministry said."

It later emerged that the Microsoft Teams call lasted for almost 10 minutes, and came while Wallace was visiting Poland.Blaming the government in Moscow, the minister denounced the call as an example of “Russian disinformation, distortion and dirty tricks” and launched an internal security investigation into how the pranksters were able to contact him in the first place.On Tuesday, the notorious pranksters Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov – going by the monikers Vovan and Lexus – confirmed they had been behind the call and posted several teasers, saying the full video would be up soon. The duo has a long history of pranking celebrities and public figures, including Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. They have denied being agents of the government."

Russia and India are currently preparing a rupee-ruble mechanism which would allow them to trade in national currencies while evading the dollar.According to Gopinath, the radical restrictive measures introduced by Western countries amid Russia’s military operation in Ukraine could lead to the emergence of small currency blocs based on trade between individual groups of countries. Furthermore, the use of currencies other than the dollar or the euro in global trade would lead to further diversification of the reserve assets held by national central banks.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

Earlier, the American leader called Putin ""a war criminal"" and ""a thug"".","Russian State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin said that only an ""old or sick man"" would behave the way US President Joe Biden did in Poland on Saturday when he once again assailed the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin. On Friday, Biden headed to Poland, the final destination of his European tour, after taking part in an extraordinary NATO summit over Russia's military operation in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters during his meeting with the Ukrainian refugees on Saturday, Biden called Putin ""a butcher"". Volodin's sentiment was echoed by another State Duma member, Leonid Slutsky, who is also a member of the Russian delegation in the negotiations between Kiev and Moscow amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Biden earlier slammed Putin as ""a war criminal"" when speaking about the ongoing military operation in Ukraine launched by the Kremlin. This remark also received criticism from Russia, with Russian Ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov saying that such statements ""go beyond common sense"". The Kremlin called the ""war criminal"" remarks unacceptable, especially when coming from the leader of a country with a history of killing hundreds of thousands around the world. According to Moscow, the goal of the Russian military operation in Ukraine is to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" the country, with the Russian troops exclusively targeting military infrastructure and posing no threat to civilians.  Western countries have condemned the military operation, with the United States being among the most vocal critics. They have called Moscow's actions in Ukraine an invasion and imposed harsh sanctions targeting the Russian economy, financial sector, culture, sports, media outlets and many other things. "

The arrangement would allow India and Russia to carry out financial operations bypassing the US dollar. Russia is effectively blocked from using US currency due to Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine.According to the official, the Indian government is working on a proposal to allow up to five nationalized Indian banks to be engaged in the rupee-ruble trade mechanism, and discussions between the central bank governor, the finance minister, and the banks on the matter have already been held. The arrangement would let Indian exporters continue doing business with Russia despite sanctions banning, among other things, international payment mechanisms in the country, such as SWIFT. It would also let India continue buying Russian energy exports and other goods.According to Sakthivel, the Indian economy could profit from sanctions Russia is facing, as they give Indian exporters an opportunity to expand on the Russian market.“Export to Russia is not much, only in agriculture and pharmacy products. Now that the whole of the West is banning Russia, there will be a lot of opportunities for Indian firms to enter Russia,” he stated.India’s finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India have not yet commented on the new trade arrangement.Unlike the US and the EU, India has not criticized Russia over its military operation in Ukraine, and has abstained from condemning Moscow during the recent UN voting rounds. When asked whether India’s continued commerce with Russia would draw Western ire, Sakthivel said his country had taken a “neutral stand” on the situation in Ukraine.“The government will take into account all the factors. The government is playing it very carefully,” he stressed.India exported $3.3 billion worth of goods to Russia in 2021, mostly pharmaceutical products, tea, and coffee. In terms of imports, India bought $6.9 billion worth of Russian products, including arms and defense goods, mineral resources, fertilizers, metals, diamonds and other precious stones. India also imports Russian oil, with recent media reports stating that the country’s major refiner, Indian Oil Corp, has stepped up purchases of Russian crude over the past month. India is also reportedly considering buying raw materials from Russia and Belarus for fertilizer production amid skyrocketing commodities’ prices.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

(via @MikeCoppinger) pic.twitter.com/c278tU8THB""So I don't know where that stands with either guy, whether they're going to accept the offer of the Cultural Minister of Ukraine to leave and to train for fights,"" Arum concluded.ESPN cited sources as saying that Usyk will cross the border to Poland and begin training for a second meeting with Joshua this summer after relieving the Brit of his WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO straps at Tottenham Hotspur's stadium last September. On Wednesday, the BBC claimed that Usyk, who was born in Crimea, had already left for Poland and understands the Olympic gold medalist will hold his training camp elsewhere.ESPN added that Usyk didn't need permission in order to leave Ukraine, as there is an exception to the martial law that prevents Ukrainian men from 18 to 60 fleeing the country if they have three or more children under the age of 18.While Usyk has three children, Lomachenko has two but has reportedly decided to stay in Ukraine and therefore turn down the chance to win back the lightweight belts he lost to Teofimo Lopez in 2020.In Lopez's first defense of the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and The Ring crowns, he was upset by Kambosos who will now reportedly face WBC champion Devin Haney Down Under as each man vies to become the division's first undisputed champion since Pernell Whitaker in 1990 on June 5. ""I spoke to Egis Klimas [Lomachenko's manager] and he confirmed that Loma would not be available to fight George,"" Kambosos' promoter Lou DiBella revealed to Boxing Scene.""When the Ukrainian government gave their consent, we didn't get an affirmative answer from Loma and we had a feeling there would be no fight.""Egis confirmed to us today that he will stay in Ukraine, and that is commendable.""Fears that Usyk would not be able to honor the rematch clause in his original agreement with Joshua circled when Usyk said that he ""really didn't know"" when he would be stepping back into the ring to CNN earlier in March.""My country and my honor are more important to me than a championship belt,"" Usyk stated, though he now seems to have reversed that stance.Other boxing figures aiding Ukraine's defense forces are former heavyweight champion boxing brothers Vitali Klitschko – who is the mayor of Kiev – and sibling Wladimir."

Among other measures, it would introduce a prison sentence of up to four years for anyone entering the country without the correct immigration documents. It would also make it impossible for an illegal immigrant to immediately apply for asylum.According to The Guardian, citing a Home Office briefing note for MPs, ministers won’t compromise on these measures and plan to block the Lords’ amendments aimed at softening the bill.As the number of Ukrainian refugees fleeing their country amid war with Russia grows, and is now being counted in the millions, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called on Conservative parliamentarians to put pressure on the government to make it agree to amend the bill.“It is unbelievable and deeply shameful that at a time like this [Home Secretary] Priti Patel is still pushing ahead with plans that could criminalise desperate Ukrainians who arrived in the UK with the wrong papers and mean vulnerable refugees who have fled war or persecution could end up with prison sentences,” Cooper said.The government apparently does not agree with this logic, however: the Home Office source quoted by The Guardian said the bill’s purpose was to crack down on people-smuggling and would thus help free up more resources for refugees such as those from Ukraine. The home secretary is known for her tough stance when it comes to illegal immigration. The numbers of migrants trying to cross the English Channel have dramatically increased in recent years, and Patel has pledged to fix “the broken asylum system” and “reduce the incentives” for those illegally entering the UK, thus “removing the opportunity for criminal gangs to profit.”On Monday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the UK had already issued 9,500 visas to Ukrainians with family connections in the country, and that 150,000 people had signed up to host refugees through the Homes for Ukraine program. In total, he said he expected “hundreds of thousands” of Ukrainians to arrive imminently in Britain.However, charity organizations apparently do not share Javid’s optimism, saying UK visa applications are long and difficult to complete, especially for people  under duress, and therefore might become a serious obstacle for refugees.Though the UK says measures are being taken to simplify the process, a visa waiver for Ukrainians is apparently not being considered. Javid made it clear that “some level of security checks” on all asylum seekers was necessary.According to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, some 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country since February 24, when Russia launched its “special military operation.”Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over what it said was Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims that it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."

The meeting was held “at the request” of Washington, China’s Foreign Ministry noted in a statement.China’s leader stressed that Beijing had always stood “for peace and opposes war,” urging all parties involved in the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev to return to diplomacy.“All sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace,” the Chinese statement issued after the talks reads. At the same time, President Xi told Biden the ongoing crisis should be addressed on another level as well.The US and NATO should also have dialogue with Russia to address the crux of the Ukraine crisis and ease the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine.Biden, for his part, “underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis,” warning Beijing of “the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia,” a brief readout of the discussion released by the White House notes. Both Moscow and Beijing have denied Russia had ever sought help from China amid the ongoing offensive in Ukraine, refuting media reports suggesting so.Biden and Xi also discussed the outstanding issues in the bilateral ties of their countries, with China’s Foreign Ministry and the White House producing somewhat contradictory accounts of the statements made by the two leaders during the talks.“President Xi pointed out that the China-US relationship, instead of getting out of the predicament created by the previous US administration, has encountered a growing number of challenges,” the Chinese statement reads, blaming the “current situation” on “some people on the US side” who “have not followed through on the important common understanding reached by the two presidents.”“Biden reiterated that the US does not seek a new Cold War with China; it does not aim to change China’s system; the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China; the US does not support ‘Taiwan independence’; and it has no intention to seek a conflict with China,” the statement reads.However, the White House said Biden had only “reiterated that US policy on Taiwan has not changed, and emphasized that the United States continues to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo.”Taiwan has long been one of the main stumbling blocks in US-China relations. Beijing considers the island an integral part of its territory, yet it has not governed Taiwan for decades, as it became the last stronghold of nationalist forces during the Chinese civil war.At the same time, Taiwan has enjoyed a cozy relationship with the US, particularly in military cooperation, which Beijing regards as a breach of its One China policy, which America recognizes. China has repeatedly accused Washington of meddling in its internal affairs and of fueling “separatist” sentiments on the island. Both the US and China have repeatedly flexed their military muscle near Taiwan, with Beijing frequently staging massive drills nearby and sending in large air and naval forces into areas claimed by Taiwan as its sovereign territory."

April 9, I will prove that I am the best in the world!” the 29-year-old said alongside an image of him at a Miami airport.“Just landed in USA, Aljo’s prayers wasn’t answered,” he added on Twitter.Just landed in USA, Alja’s prayers wasn’t answered 👊🏼Yan's comments come after several members of his corner team were reportedly struggling to obtain visas to enter the United States, meaning that the Russian fighter would have to hastily assemble a new staff to put him through his paces between now and fight night, as well as in-between rounds at UFC 273.Russia's ongoing military operation in Ukraine has led to visa applications for some Russian citizens to be rejected. Yan is understood to possess a multi-year US visa and his entry into the country was unaffected. Yan has joked about the matter on social media, asking the likes of rising UFC star Sean O'Malley and even Khabib Nurmagomedov to corner him for the fight.A member of Yan's team has recently said that he will at least have the services of manager Sayat Abdrakhmanov and veteran trainer Alexei Sorokin in his corner. But whoever ends up walking him to the cage in Jacksonville, Florida next month, Yan says that the Sterling rematch will be a mere formality.“My long training camp has come to an end, thank you to all the people who were close to me. All that remains is to arrive, make weight, and do my job,” he said in an Instagram video, via translation.A post shared by Петр ""No Mercy"" Ян (@petr_yan)"

The ministry noted that Ankara held talks with Russia and Ukraine regarding the incident later in the day. The movement of ships through the Bosphorus was temporarily suspended, but resumed later in the day. A video purportedly showing the said mine has since emerged online. In the meantime, reports suggest that another mine has been spotted near the popular tourist destination of Agva. Previously, reports suggested that multiple mines installed by Ukraine in the Black Sea, had left their anchors due to a storm and drifted away, posing a danger to ships in the Turkish straits. "

The president congratulated Russian National Guard members and veterans on their professional holiday, wishing them and their families good health and success.  He also pointed to the significant contribution of the National Guard in the fight against terrorism, extremism, and organized crime.""Created six years ago, Rosgvardiya has become an integral, reliable link in the unified state system for ensuring law and order, protecting the rights and interests of our citizens,"" Putin said. The Russian president earlier stressed that the operation does not aim to occupy any Ukrainian territory. The main goal was said to be the “demilitarization” and “denazification of the country” and to bring to justice all war criminals responsible for ""bloody crimes against civilians"" in the Donbass. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Armed Forces target only military infrastructure and Ukrainian troops.  According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the goal is to protect the people of Donbas, ""who have been subjected to abuse, genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years."" In response to the special operation, some countries and enterprises have imposed large-scale sanctions against Russian officials, businesses and citizens. "

Wallace denounced the call as an example of “Russian disinformation, distortion and dirty tricks,” offering no evidence.Home Secretary Priti Patel chimed in, saying this also happened to her “earlier this week,” calling it a “pathetic attempt at such difficult times to divide us.”Her Labour shadow Holly Lynch called it “worrying” that someone fraudulently managed to gain access to two of UK’s most senior government ministers in charge of defense, telling The Guardian that “an urgent investigation must look into how this happened so the necessary steps can be taken to avoid any more such incidents.”Reuters later reported that Wallace had ordered just such an investigation. Ukrainian PM Denys Shmyhal has kept a low profile since the start of the conflict, with President Volodymyr Zelensky doing most of Kiev’s public relations outreach in the West.Mere minutes before Wallace tweeted about his mystery caller, Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov posted on Facebook that Kiev’s Western allies should be on the lookout for “lords of war” seeking to profit from the flow of military aid to his country.“Such characters introduce themselves as ‘advisers’, ‘assistants’, ‘heads of departments’, and even present fake ‘documents’ to prove their ‘official positions’,” Reznikov said, but are in fact “scum, looters and traitors” seeking to line their own pockets or help the enemy. He urged Western governments to double-check everyone’s credentials with Ukraine’s embassies or military attaches, and turn in all imposters to police."

Moscow said that by doing so, Kiev tries to draw Russian fire onto its own citizens in order to later accuse Russia of targeting them.","The Retroville shopping mall in Kiev, which was destroyed last night, was allegedly hosting Ukrainian Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) firing on Russian positions. Several videos making the rounds on social media purportedly show Ukrainian artillery moving in the vicinity of the shopping mall. One video allegedly depicts at least one Ukrainian MLRS firing from what looks like the mall's parking lot, located near a civilian apartment building. Additionally, a photo distributed via Twitter shows what appears to be the now-destroyed mall serving as a temporary garage for Grad MLRS (NATO reporting name M1964). Russia has repeatedly condemned tactics used by the Ukrainian military and nationalist battalions to deploy their artillery and MLRS units in areas densely populated by civilians. Moscow has alleged that this is done to provoke Russian forces into attacking civilian objects and then blame the casualties on Moscow. The Russian Defence Ministry has stressed on several occasions that Russia's Armed Forces do everything in their power to avoid hitting civilian infrastructure and avoid casualties among ordinary Ukrainians. Moscow and Kiev negotiated the establishment of humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from several cities, but Russian forces reported that in some areas, local nationalist battalions prevent people from leaving cities via the corridors and instead use them as human shields. President Vladimir Putin ordered to start the special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February following a request from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) to protect them from attacks by Ukrainian forces. Putin said that the main goals of the mission are the demilitarisation and de-Nazification of Ukraine. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

She and her husband stand at the gate to the front yard of their suburban home holding simple provisions that have just been delivered to them. These include fresh bread, grains, tea, coffee, and medicine. A few hours later, on the way back, the volunteers’ car will return to an area with phone reception, and journalists will call the woman’s relatives in Russia to tell them she’s okay. This will be good news, as there have been no communication services in Volnovakha since fighting, once again, broke out there almost three weeks ago.The city is approximately halfway between Mariupol and Donetsk in a region recognised by Russia as belonging to the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). According to Western media outlets, and the online Wikipedia resource, it no longer exists. Indeed, the latter currently carries its obituary, saying: ""Volnovakha was a small city in Ukraine... before being destroyed during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the population of the city was 21,441.""According to local sources, Kiev's forces had built substantial military fortifications on the outskirts of Volnovakha. However, the long trenches and deep dugouts are intact, having been untouched by the DPR's offensive. This would appear to back up assertions that the Ukrainians retreated to the town proper, perhaps with a view to preventing their opponents from using artillery or calling in air strikes. Of course, this meant that residential areas of the city bore the brunt of the fighting. A little way into the town, there is a large sculpture with “I ♡ VOLNOVAKHA” inscribed on it. On the heart between the two words, someone has spray-painted the letter Z, the symbol of Russia’s military operation. There is a ruined church next to the inscription. Apparently, it fell into decay and began to collapse a few years ago. The same cannot be said for the rest of the city. It is badly damaged, and this has just happened recently.The first time I was in Volnovakha, the roads were littered with fallen trees and debris from buildings. Dead soldiers were still lying in some places, while destroyed military equipment and civilian cars crushed by tanks were evident every now and then. Over the next couple of days, the corpses were removed, the roads were cleared, and the burned tanks and armored personnel carriers were shifted to the side of the road. The DPR’s Ministry of Emergency Situations has already begun to work on repairing some of the buildings, but there is a lot of work to be done.A significant proportion of the city’s private homes have burned down or been destroyed by explosions. There are traces of shrapnel everywhere. The rare house may still have its fence or window panes intact. Many windows are sealed with plastic or boarded up. The words “people live here” are often found on the gates written in chalk. You often meet abandoned dogs on the street – both large yard dogs and expensive pets.Owners of houses can stoke a stove to warm up, fetch food from the cellar, and feed themselves for a while, but the inhabitants of multi-story buildings, of which there are many in Volnovakha, can’t do this. One block lined with five-story buildings at the other end of the city can only be reached by maneuvering from side to side because the dirt road still contains unexploded landmines. These are currently fenced off with pieces of plywood and marked with red rags, waiting to be cleared.The apartment buildings are located a short distance from each other. They all have three entrances, and an improvised kitchen has been set up in front of each one. A kettle or a pot boils above a fire built within a circle of bricks. You can warm your hands by the fire. Among other humanitarian supplies, this district’s residents are especially happy with candles. Because of the cold, they have to live in the basements of their buildings, and the lack of electricity forces them to sit in the dark.In one of the buildings, residents are trying to fix apartment windows as quickly as possible and hope for the arrival of spring. The battles for the city have left the basement uninhabitable. When a tank salvo hit the house, several floors collapsed, and the basement ceiling caved in. According to Vasily and Vladimir, who told this story, a Ukrainian tank opened fire on the building.They unlock the basement, and we go down. Daylight illuminates the room through the collapsed ceiling. Everything is covered in concrete dust and littered with debris. During the attack, the residents made it to the exit in time and no one was killed, but three people were injured. Vasily says the building was attacked on the morning of March 11. The first two shots missed, but the third hit, leading to the destruction. Vladimir says the shells came from the direction of the hostel, which has a well-stocked bomb shelter, unlike residential buildings. The fighters of the Ukrainian Armed Forces occupied it themselves after driving its residents out, and several tanks, armored personnel carriers, and military Humvees were placed around the building.“We put a grill on the street and were cooking meat with our grandchildren,” says Vasily. “Two soldiers with the Ukrainian National Guard passed by and began to rudely ask why I wasn’t fighting. I said something like, ‘How am I going to fight at my age? And here, in the basement, I have children with grandchildren. Do I have to leave them and go somewhere to die? For what? For what idea?’ The next day we were attacked.”Vladimir confirms that the Ukrainian military treated the local population with hostility. “They had a commander in their unit who boasted that he was a veteran, a hero of the so-called ‘anti-terrorist operation’ (the official name of Ukraine’s military actions in the Donbass – RT). He said they were here to stay,” he asserts. The DPR troops who came to the city did not know that people were hiding in the basements, as the Ukrainian side had reported that they had already been evacuated, Vasily says. At the same time, he claims it was actually impossible or even dangerous to evacuate. Few people wanted to leave for territory controlled by Kiev, and the Ukrainian military forbade them from heading for Donbass’ pro-Russian republics. Vladimir also claims the Ukrainians deliberately shelled a nearby hospital in order to smoke people out.Tatyana accompanies me to the hospital. She has also lived in Volnovakha most of her life. “They deliberately destroyed us. They needed the land. And then, it seems, the land was no longer needed, so they just beat us out of anger,” she says, pointing to holes blown into the hospital by shells and shrapnel-scarred asphalt. Then she takes me to the morgue, a small building that has also been noticeably damaged by shooting. The door turns out to be unlocked, and I see the morgue is completely filled with dead bodies. They lie in the corridor stacked up in two or three layers. According to Tatyana, the National Guard soldiers siphoned diesel fuel from the hospital’s generators, so all the old people who depended on artificial ventilation devices died. The Ukrainian military allegedly said they would “leave nothing” in Volnovakha if they were ousted by pro-Russian forces.I can neither confirm nor disprove the reports of these alleged war crimes but, on the same day, I pass information about them to an expert from a public organization that deals with such incidents. The very next day, the testimony of Tatyana and her neighbors, as well as the hospital staff, was recorded by specialists. At the time of publication, no specific conclusions have been drawn.Tall fir trees stand in the park at the entrance to the hospital. They were badly damaged by shrapnel. The whole yard is littered with spruce branches, large and small. On the road, people are mostly on bicycles.  This is now the main means of transportation here. Tatyana insists that the Ukrainian military deliberately attacked civilians. “You understand, the whole of Volnovakha is one huge war crime. These are sadists. I do not know where the world is looking, or why it doesn’t want to see this!” she says. After hearing our conversation, an elderly man on a Soviet bicycle with a bag of groceries slows down. He says a National Guard patrol shot at him just for fun, for no apparent reason. As confirmation, he points to a bullet hole in his bicycle’s frame. I don’t have time to ask his name before he continues on his way.There is a fresh grave a few meters from the entrance to one of the buildings. A homemade cross containing a surname, initials, and dates of birth and death has been placed right on top of a flowerbed there. This is the temporary burial place of a local resident who died in a huge fire that broke out in her apartment after a shell hit gas lines in her building.  According to her neighbors, the woman was completely incinerated. Only her skull and a piece of her neck remained. It was decided that it was better to bury her remains than leave them lying in her apartment until the hostilities ended. Nadezhda, one of her neighbors, takes me up to the third floor, where the apartment of the deceased is, or, more precisely, was. The explosion destroyed most of the interior walls, and the fire turned the living space into dusty ashes. Among the debris on the floor, broken dishes can be discerned, and a surviving porcelain figurine is visible – a Cossack in trousers and with a forelock. Going back down, I see that many other apartments have also been damaged. All were abandoned in a hurry. “Civilians lived here, there were no soldiers... now everyone lives in the basement,” Nadezhda says, almost crying.Humanitarian missions, both official and volunteer, come to Volnovakha almost every day. But despite their help, basements at the beginning of spring are still very cold, so volunteers are trying to take out the sick, elderly, and children. The RT humanitarian project removed two wheelchair users from a private house. A minibus specially driven in for this took them to a medical facility in Donetsk. And volunteers moved 81-year-old Anatoly, Vladimir’s father, who spoke to us in the basement.Anatoly takes a bag of warm clothes with him, as well as needed medicine. We set off for a village in Donetsk’s suburbs, where his sister and niece live. When the fighting broke out, they had invited their relatives from Volnovakha to move in with them, but this became impossible very quickly. On the way back, I notice that houses which had appeared abandoned just a couple of days ago are beginning to show signs of habitation again.We stop in the city center near another hospital to drop off a box full of medicine and food. Doctors continue their work but lack sufficient supplies. Moreover, they have to work in the basement, as almost all of the windows in the building are broken. Entering it with volunteers, I notice an abundance of shell casings on the floor. There has been fighting here recently.The silence is broken by an explosion somewhere nearby, and then another. A soldier from the military commandant’s office explains that it is the Ministry of Emergency Situations blowing up unexploded shells. A truck bearing the name of the same ministry is parked opposite us, loaded with the first batch of materials for repairing the buildings. While we are talking with the serviceman, a local resident approaches and informs him that he has found a machine gun in his yard. They leave together and soon return with the weapon. Judging by a sticker, it was thrown away by a fleeing Ukrainian soldier.After a short stay at the hospital, we take Anatoly to the outskirts of Donetsk, making a big detour. His sister and niece cry with joy and invite us in for tea, but, when we refuse, they produce a gift: a frozen chicken. At sunset, news arrives: telephone communication will soon be restored in Volnovakha, and Anatoly will be able to hear from the relatives who remain there. In the meantime, the rumble of artillery can be heard in Donetsk, urban combat continues in Mariupol, and the front still divides families."

As a result, the country’s oil has been available at discounted prices. The Indian oil major says it did not consider the purchase of Russian crude a problem as neither oil itself, nor Vitol have been sanctioned, reports say.Washington, DC has been pressuring New Delhi to avoid purchasing Russian oil due to the Ukraine conflict. India rejected America's requests on Friday, arguing that its dependence on energy imports should not be “politicized” as countries that are oil-independent or still importing Russian products “cannot credibly advocate restrictive trading,” local media reported.India is the world’s third-biggest energy consumer, importing roughly 80% of crude oil it needs. Only about 3% of the country's total crude imports come from Russia.OPEC predicted this week that the country’s demand for oil is likely to jump by more than 8% in 2022 amid steady economic growth. In its latest monthly oil market report, OPEC said that rising energy prices, fueled by the recent geopolitical tensions, could put more pressure on India’s current account balance.New Delhi stated that it would “be happy” to take Russian oil and other commodities at a heavy discount, using the national currencies of India and Russia to carry out the transactions to evade the US dollar and related sanctions, an Indian government official told Reuters.An official at the Ministry of External Affairs was quoted as saying that India was “exploring all possibilities” to ensure its energy security. According to local media, comments from the senior official indicate that the Indian government has adopted a pragmatic approach and is likely to forge ahead by sourcing Russian crude.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"

I will need to see what happens next,” said the US Open champion, AFP reported.“I try to take it tournament by tournament. I mean, there are always different rules, regulations in order to play or not to play.“Right now I'm here in Miami. I can play and I’m happy to play tennis, the sport I love. I want to promote the sport all over the world. We’ll have tough moments and good moments.”The International Tennis Federation (ITF) has allowed Russian and Belarusian stars to continue to compete as neutrals in the wake of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, but has said players from the two countries must appear without any national symbols.Medvedev, 26, has removed the Russian flag from his social media accounts and said in Miami that he would effectively have to accept it if certain countries decided to impose separate rules in contradiction to those issued by sporting federations.“Every country can set their own rules. Maybe tomorrow somebody’s going to announce, I don’t know, that we don’t want any more tennis tournaments,” said Medvedev. “Say one country has a Grand Slam, and maybe some other Masters events are going to say, ‘We don’t want any more tennis in our country.’ That’s how life is.“It’s very tough in life to talk about what is fair and not fair. So I of course do have my own opinions on different topics, but I prefer to speak about them with my family, with my wife, where we can sometimes disagree, but we can discuss. It’s much easier when you have a dialogue about this.”The next tournament for Medvedev after Miami will be the Rolex Masters in Monte-Carlo, which he said counts as a “home” event as he is a resident there.Beyond that lies the Grand Slam at Roland-Garros which gets underway at the end of May, before Wimbledon is due to start on June 27 – a tournament where Medvedev’s best previous run was to the fourth round last year.Since Russia launched its military offensive in Ukraine last month, Medvedev has issued calls for peace without mentioning the specific conflict – a stance he stuck to in Miami.“I think everybody knows what’s happening, so it’s basically of course impossible to ignore it,” Medvedev told reporters.“I always said I’m for peace. I want everybody to be safe, healthy, myself included, other people included, everybody in the world. Sometimes it’s not possible, but, yeah, that’s what I want.”Medvedev become the first new name in 18 years to rise to the world number one spot at the end of February, ending Novak Djokovic’s reign at the top of the ATP rankings.The Serb recaptured the position three weeks later when Medvedev suffered a shock third-round exit at Indian Wells, although a run to the semifinals in Miami would see the Russian rise to the pinnacle again.Djokovic has been forced to miss Indian Wells and the Miami Open as his unvaccinated status means he cannot travel to the US, but is set to line up with Medvedev at Monte-Carlo in April. "

Linde called the decision “historic.""Meanwhile, the German Press Agency reported that German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht has asked the country’s armed forces to provide 2,000 rocket-propelled grenades from its own stockpiles to Ukraine.Sweden will double its contribution to Ukraine’s Armed Forces with 5.000 additional anti-tank weapons and demining equipment.

Sweden, which has steadily increased its military budget since 2014, announced recently that it will boost spending to 2% of GDP “as soon as possible,” an increase of around a third over its present level.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also announced last month that he’ll hike defense spending to 2% of GDP and invest Є100 billion ($113 billion) in weaponry, including Israeli drones and American F-35 fighter jets.NATO tasks its members with spending a minimum of 2% of GDP on defense, a target many fall short of. This shortfall was repeatedly criticized by former US President Donald Trump, who accused European nations, particularly Germany, of freeloading off of US military protection.Unlike Germany, Sweden is not a member of NATO, and the government in Stockholm has said that it intends to remain out of the Cold War-era alliance.It is unclear when and how the German and Swedish arms will be delivered to Ukraine. Russia has declared that it considers military supply convoys into Ukraine “legitimate targets,” and Germany’s government stated last week that details of such shipments will no longer be made public, presumably to avoid Russian intelligence tracking their route."

The operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine was ordered by Putin on 24 February.","During a mission conducted as part of Moscow's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, the crew of a Russian Mi-24 attack helicopter managed to evade a rocket fired by Ukrainian troops from a portable missile system, the Russian Defence Ministry has revealed. In an interview released by the ministry on Monday, Mi-24 commander Oleg Esman explained that the incident took place as a group of Russian combat helicopters cleared a Ukrainian airfield to ensure the landing of Russian paratroopers from Mi-8 transport choppers. Referring to his Mi-24 helicopter facing a frontal attack, the Russian pilot said that he saw a Stinger missile fly literally ""toward his forehead"", adding that he actually had no time to make a decision. Even though the missile damaged the tail of the helicopter, the Mi-24 was able to continue firing, something that helped it go ahead with the mission of clearing the Ukrainian airfield. With its fuselage fitted with thick armour plates, the Mi-24 is nicknamed the ""flying tank"" for the helicopter's ability to take hits and keep flying. The nickname is also a tribute to the World War II-era Soviet Il-2 ground-attack aircraft that terrified Nazi troops over its capacity to continue fighting despite massive damage to its fuselage. The Russian Defence Ministry has since said that Russian Ka-52 and Mi-28N helicopters destroyed 15 more Ukrainian armoured vehicles during strikes in the early hours of Monday. According to Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov, the vehicles included 8 tanks, 4 infantry fighting vehicles, and 3 armoured personnel carriers, as part of Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. President Putin ordered the start of the operation on 24 February following a request from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) to protect them from attacks by Ukrainian forces.  He stated that Russia was left with no other choice but to intervene to help the newly-recognised Donbass republics. He described the goals of the operation as the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine and vowed that the Russian armed forces will only be targeting military objectives.

Apparently, that’s what YouTube wants. Block out everything Russia says, promote everything the West says. WION does not subscribe to that sort of journalism. Its objective is to remain balanced,” it added.The channel said YouTube was “rigging the game” by acting as a platform and a censor at the same time.It called on its audience for support, launching the campaign #YouTubeUnblockWION on social media. Its viewers responded to the call, posting more than 25,000 tweets with the hashtag in just 12 hours.On Saturday, it announced that YouTube had backed down and lifted the ban. It was not clear whether this was as a result of the campaign or had been down to other factors.WION uploaded more than 20 videos on its channel in the first five hours after the ban was lifted, with a significant proportion of them being about the events in Ukraine.Since Moscow launched its offensive in Ukraine in late February, YouTube has blocked the pages of almost 40 Russian news broadcasters – RT’s and Sputnik’s among them. The Russian authorities have warned the video-sharing platform that it could itself be banned in the country if those restrictions aren’t lifted."

In the meantime, Russian forces, as well as the DPR and LPR militias, continue to advance in Donbass, tightening the encirclement around the remaining Ukrainian radicals in Mariupol and taking control over multiple settlements. According to the Defence Ministry, since the beginning of the special op in Ukraine, Russian troops have destroyed some 1,500 tanks, over 1,200 military vehicles, and over 200 drones of the Ukrainian armed forces. Russia launched its special operation in Ukraine on 24 February, in order to stop the eight-year-long campaign waged by Kiev in Donbass. President Vladimir Putin stressed it was started to rescue the people of Donbass from genocide, and added that Russia's goal is the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine. "

In the Netherlands, €194 million worth in the last week alone, per Dutch Central Bank Manager Klaas Knot. And now, amid the mad dash for Russian cash, EU officials are looking to funnel the funds into a so-called “war reparations fund” for the beleaguered Ukrainian regime, according to a report by Bloomberg. The EU has been collaborating closely with the United States amid widespread mainstream western denunciations of the ongoing Russian special military operation aimed at demilitarizing and denazifying Ukraine, which was spurred by near-continuous attacks on Russian-speaking communities in eastern Ukraine which has killed well over 10,000 people since 2014. On Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Attorney General Merrick Garland announced they are unleashing a “task force” to “seize and freeze” assets from “REPO,” or “Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs.” The efforts are part of an ongoing economic pressure campaign, consisting mainly of NATO-aligned nations, to attack Russian individuals. Official statements described the move as an initiative to take “legal steps to find, restrain, freeze, seize, and, where appropriate, confiscate or forfeit” the assets of Russians accused of having connections with the Russian government. Just a day later, the EU announced a “Freeze and Seize” operation to work alongside the US and coordinate collaboration among Western powers. The so-called “task forces” are reportedly slated to operate alongside a previously announced US Justice Department-led initiative called “KleptoCapture” which is also aimed at seizing funds and assets of those labeled “Putin affiliates” by Western nations. On Tuesday, US Senators unveiled legislation under which wealthy Russians’ assets could be seized and auctioned off, with the profits also benefiting the Ukrainian regime. The “Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act” would allow the US government to take and sell assets valued at over $2 million from not just Russians slapped with US sanctions but also “foreigners linked to the Russian government,” according to Forbes. While the legislation currently stipulates the proceeds from the sale of such ill-gotten goods would be used ""only for the benefit of the people of Ukraine,"" Forbes notes this category would include “military assistance.” By all indications, Kiev needs it. Amid what Forbes described as “growing concern about Ukraine’s ability to sustain its military operations and provide services to its citizens.” But with the ongoiing operation, it’s unclear whether such funds will make much of an impact on the current balance of forces. As US government-funded outlet VOA News noted, “Investigations,” into accused offenders “can drag on for months and years.” "

The US is working on a half-dozen hypersonic weapons, but has yet to field any.","US President Joe Biden has acknowledged the capabilities of Russian hypersonic missiles and commented on their use in Ukraine. The president’s comments followed a pair of Kinzhal missile strikes Friday and Saturday targeting weapons and fuel depots in western and south-central Ukraine. The first strike targeted a fortified underground missile and ammo depot in Delyatin, Ivano-Frankivsk region. The facility was built in the Soviet period and designed to withstand a nuclear blast. The second strike destroyed a fuel and lubricant base in Konstantinovka, Nikolaev region which the Russian military said served as the main supply base used by Ukrainian ground forces in southern Ukraine. First introduced into service in December 2017 and carried on board MiG-31K jets or Tu-22 and Tu-160 bombers, the Kinzhal has a range of over 2,000 km and a top speed of up to Mach 12 (14,700 km per hour). It is also said to have the capability to manoeuvre in flight, making it next to impossible to intercept using any currently existing air defences. The Russian military has reported on the destruction of over 90 percent of Ukraine’s air defence capabilities in the course of its ongoing military operation in the country. The United States and its allies have sought to shore up Kiev’s air defences using S-300s and other Soviet-era systems.

It is thought that bidders with experience in property investment are involved, with this being considered a benefit as the club looks to build a new stadium far in excess of the capacity of their current Stamford Bridge ground which holds just over 41,000 people.Bidders are also understood to be required to rubber-stamp guarantees of £1 billion ($1.3 billion) in future investment, which is thought to be a fund to guarantee that player investment will continue at a similar pace as it did throughout the Abramovich era.Once the final bids are received on April 11, it is thought that the full takeover could be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of that month.The successful bidder will also be required to be approved by the UK government, who have imposed a litany of financial restrictions on Chelsea following Abramovich's sanctioning given that the club is considered to be one of the Russian's numerous assets. It is also thought that Abramovich will have an influence over the winning bid.Several of the interested parties have a wealth of experience at the helm of successful US-based sports franchises.American financiers Josh Harris and Dave Blitzer have backed a bid by the UK's Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Sebastien Coe, with the US duo already holding a stake in NBA team the Philadelphia 76ers and NHL outfit the New Jersey Devils.Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive is also said to be interested, as is LA Dodgers owner Todd Boehly, as well as a handful of others.However, an offer Chicago Cubs chief Tom Ricketts has proved unpopular with the Stamford Bridge faithful amid reports that his father Joe had previously been involved in sending Islamaphobic emails. "

Geremeev is one of the Chechen commanders taking part in the fighting in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Currently believed to be recovering from a frontline injury, Geremeev was previously linked by some to the 2015 assassination of liberal politician Boris Nemtsov, although he was never charged with a crime.“On my way to Mariupol I visited my dear brother and personally saw that he was not in mortal danger. He is on the mend and will soon be back in the ranks,” Kadyrov said on his Telegram account, calling Geremeev “a real soldier and true patriot.”It was Geremeev’s unit that put up the Chechen flag on the city hall in Mariupol last week, Kadyrov added.Geremeev has some notoriety among Russian liberal circles, who suspect him of having a hand in the death of Nemtsov. The opposition politician was gunned down in central Moscow in February 2015 while walking across a bridge with his Ukrainian girlfriend.Five Chechens were sentenced to prison terms for carrying out the hit but the person who commissioned it was never identified. A man named Ruslan Muhudinov as the middleman and organizer of the crime, according to Russian prosecutors and is now on the run. Muhudinov served as a driver in a military unit, in which Geremeev served as deputy commander.Russian prosecutors sought to interview Geremeev during the investigation, according to a paper trail, but reportedly failed to do so. He was never formally charged with any crime related to the hit.A lawyer representing Nemtsov’s family claimed that Russia’s Investigative Committee decided against filing an injunction due to shortage of evidence against him.The US blamed Geremeev for Nemtsov’s death and placed him on the sanctions list in 2019, offering no evidence of his involvement.Chechen units have taken part in the fighting for Mariupol, a coastal city in southeastern Ukraine which has long been the stronghold of “Azov,” the Ukrainian regiment openly using Nazi insignia.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."

By the standards of history, this area has emerged quite recently, and has always stood a little apart. It’s important to understand its evolution when viewing this crisis, which began in 2014. Today, Donbass is an industrial and mining region, but for a long time it was largely uninhabited. The steppe zone that ran along the southern borders of medieval ‘Rus’ (not yet divided into Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus) was called the ‘Wild Fields.’ It was home to nomadic peoples and farmers only moved south with great difficulty. After the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, the Wild Fields  was a dangerous place to find yourself. Around four hundred years, a few peasants from Russia and Ukraine began to gradually settle in the future Donbass.A great leap forward came in the 19th century when the coal deposits discovered there became necessary for industry. It was then that many of the cities without which it is impossible to imagine today’s Donbass were founded. In 1869, the British industrialist John Hughes built a factory around which the village of Yuzovka grew – it had a few more names, including Stalino,  before a local man renamed it Donetsk, in 1961.His name was Nikita Khruschev, and he had risen from humble origins as a metal fitter to lead the Soviet Union.   In 1868, Kramatorsk appeared and, in 1878, Debaltseve. The cities grew rapidly. Coal deposits and increasing factories formed the unique ‘face’ of the region. This even applies to the landscape: wherever you go in modern Donbass, giant landfills catch your eye. Donbass was formed as an industrial region and its cities and factories often flow into one another, even today. The region was inhabited by several streams of colonists from Russia and Ukraine and its population was very diverse, but its peoples mixed easily due to the proximity of their languages and cultures. It was meteoric development in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it became a huge mine and forge for the Russian Empire, that made it the Donbass we know today.A great deal changed in 1917. Two revolutions and a civil war divided the history of the whole of Russia into ‘before’ and ‘after.’After the February Revolution, when the monarchy fell, a Provisional Committee ruled the region. Meanwhile, the Central Rada in Kiev declared Ukraine autonomous, before making a declaration of independence after the October Revolution. The Rada made broad territorial claims, which included the territory of Donbass. However, not entirely so. Yuzovka was a border city, according to the Rada’s stipulations. The nuance was that the Rada did not exercise any authority over most of these territories, and it soon was quarreling with the Provisional Government in Petrograd.The whole argument could have been quashed in parliamentary debates but, on November 7, 1917, the socialist revolution took place. After that, events took off at a gallop. In Kiev, the Communist uprising was suppressed, and Russian officers, who considered the Rada a lesser evil than the Reds, actively participated. Meanwhile, in the east of the self-proclaimed Ukraine, a very unusual coalition was being formed. Its center was Kharkov, a large industrial city that was not part of the Donetsk Basin region but closely tied to it. The Donbass’ distinct identity had already emerged by that time. Although the area was administratively divided into three entities, they had a common economy and interests. While the Rada was in session, local councils in the east of Ukraine announced the unification of the Donbass and Krivbass coal basins. It also included cities belonging to the region of the Don Cossack Army, such as Mariupol and Krivoy Rog, which was administratively part of the Kherson province, as well as Kharkov. This structure, which was informally called ‘Donkrivbass’ or simply ‘Donbass,’ did not claim independence and deemed the idea of separating from Russia absurd, considering itself, instead autonomous within it. Moreover, Ukraine’s independence projects were of no interest to it creators.Nikolai von Ditmar, chairman of the Council of Congresses of Miners of the South of Russia, noted:""Industrially, geographically, and practically speaking, this whole area is completely different from that of Kiev. This whole district has its own completely independent fundamental importance for Russia and lives a separate life. The administrative subordination of the Kharkov district to Kiev is not called for by anything at all, but on the contrary, does not correspond with reality. Such artificial subordination will only complicate and impede the life of the district, especially since this subordination is dictated by questions of expediency and state requirements, and exclusively by the national claims of the leaders of the Ukrainian movement.""In February of 1918, Fyodor Sergeyev, a Bolshevik known by the party pseudonym Artyom, proclaimed the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic (DKR) to be an autonomous region within the RSFSR, or Soviet Russia.  Was the DKR legitimate? No more and no less than any other self-proclaimed entity formed on the ruins of the Russian Empire, where states proclaimed their independence and then collapsed in a week. Another example was “Green Ukraine,” an attempt to found an independent Ukrainian state, near the Pacific Ocean. That project centered around the city of Khabarovsk, which today is a 8,924km drive from Kiev. The DKR project was not the idea of the leadership of the Bolshevik Party. It appeared precisely on the basis of a regional identity that had already been formed. The leader Vladimir Lenin knew of the upcoming creation of the DKR and did not object. The borders Artyom claimed for the republic were more modest than those drawn by the Rada, but still very wide. The DKR’s problem was the same as the Rada’s – actual control over the territory was very tenuous or nonexistent. The DKR had its own government, which included representatives of three left-wing parties – the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, and Social Revolutionaries. Some of its legislation’s nuances appear very unusual and mild by the standards of the time and place. For example, the death penalty was officially banned there. In general, Artyom and his team had a reputation among the Bolsheviks as soft-hearted liberals who hindered repression and released the ‘bourgeois’ from prison.In short, by the standards of civil war-torn Russia, the DKR was a real stronghold of humanity. In reality, everything was not going as smoothly as the creators of the republic would have liked. For example, arbitrary reprisals were prohibited but the local authorities secretly practiced them. However, the general trend was more lenient than in other places.The main problem was that Artyom and his comrades could not hold on to power. The German army, which was continuing its offensive during the First World War, was rolling in from the west, and Berlin’s forces destroyed the DKR by May of 1918.Donbass and all of Russia collapsed into the abyss. At first, the Germans plundered the region. Then it became the scene of battles between the Reds and Whites – the main sides in the civil war.However, Donbass’ ‘distinctiveness’ had not disappeared. The debate over how to deal with the area continued until 1923. The region’s place in the new order was not at all obvious. Its cities were mostly Russian in both language and self-identification. However, the occupying German forces installed a collaborationist Ukrainian government. Both Germans and Ukrainians shot political opponents and those suspected of sympathizing with the Reds. At the same time, the Ukrainian government began to implement a policy of ‘Ukrainization’ – an attempt to impose its own language and identity on the local population. One of its first orders read: “In all state institutions of the Kharkov region, all business should be conducted only in the Ukrainian language.” Another requirement was “for all institutions to replace all writing on signs, posters, and announcements with the Ukrainian language within three days... The statements from leaders claiming that it is impossible to replace the writing in three days are not considered convincing because there are already some establishments that have fulfilled this order... If signs, posters, announcements, etc have not been replaced with those containing the state language within the stipulated period, then the designated heads of districts, transportation departments, and post offices will be severely punished according to the laws of the Ukrainian People’s Republic.”These attempts were unsuccessful for a banal reason: there were not enough experts in Ukrainian to introduce the language in schools and offices. The situation reached the level of comedy when the head of the Ukrainization commission greeted subordinates in Ukrainian, after which everyone switched to Russian. After the defeat of Germany in the First World War, Donbass was easily cleared of Ukrainian formations, and the real struggle began – between the Reds and the Whites. However, the issue of Donbass’ status remained in question. Neither the Reds nor the Whites recognized any independent Ukrainian states. The Bolsheviks, however, welcomed the creation of Ukraine, but only a strictly Red one. Whatever the desires of the Rada, it could not secure its claims by force of arms, and authority on the ruins of Russia could only be imposed at gunpoint.Artyom insisted that the region should be part of Soviet Russia, basing his argument on economic ties and the language of the population. However, this idea was torpedoed by none other than Lenin, who instantly scoffed at the idea of recreating the DKR, declaring it “playing with independence.” The logic on which the Soviet leaders based Donbass’ inclusion in Ukraine is interesting:“Separating the Kharkov and Yekaterinoslav (today Dnepropetrovsk) provinces from Ukraine will create a petty-bourgeois peasant republic and lead to perpetual fear that the peasant majority will gain the advantage at some other Congress of Soviets, because the only purely proletarian districts are the mining areas of the Donetsk basin and Zaporozhye.”The Bolsheviks, who were supported mainly by workers, literally hammered the region into Ukraine precisely because the industrial region was very different from the rest of the republic. Artyom died in a railway accident in 1921 and, of course, couldn’t have prevented this. Donbass was incorporated into Soviet Ukraine without any special status, and a campaign of ‘indigenization’ was launched in the region. Soviet ideology called for the culture, language, and traditions of the people who were considered indigenous to this republic to be literally implanted in the national republics. The USSR, especially in the early days, maintained a kind of governmental ‘affirmative action’ policy. One of the leaders of the nascent Soviet Union, Nikolai Bukharin, formulated the task as follows: “One cannot even approach this from the point of view of equality of nations, and Lenin has repeatedly proved this. On the contrary, we must say that we, as a former great-power nation, must... put ourselves in an unequal position by making even greater concessions to national tendencies... Only with such a policy, when we artificially put ourselves in a lower position compared to others, only at this price can we buy ourselves the real trust of formerly oppressed nations.”The Ukrainization of Donbass was carried out systematically, and with the rigidity typical of the USSR. All mention of times when the region was autonomous were banned, there was an attempt to introduce the Ukrainian language everywhere, and, in 1930, a number of university teachers were arrested for refusing to switch to the Ukrainian language and adopt ‘Ukrainian culture.’ The Ukrainization of the press, education, and culture continued until the second half of the decade, when Joseph Stalin took national policy in different direction. However, Donbass’ distinctiveness, although somewhat faded, had not completely disappeared. The region’s way of life still significantly differed from that in the rest of Ukraine. The industrial, Russian-speaking and largely ethnically Russian region retained its distinct character both during the era of incredible upheavals in the first half of the 20th century and the stagnant times of the late USSR. And it has, likewise, been preserved since the Soviet Union collapsed, in 1991."

Women, he argued, can change the character of natural relations between humans from the “logic of domination” to the “logic of service, of care.” “Women are the protagonists of this change of course,” the Pope declared, arguing that “by acquiring power in society, [women] can change the system.” This mentality comes from “the school of Jesus Christ” and the “school of Gandhi,” he said.The Pope praised the theme of Congress for 2022, “the creative identity of men and women in a shared mission,” and called for civilization to overcome the reflexive need for “more weapons, more sanctions, more political-military alliances.”The Pope has been outspoken in his opposition to the war in Ukraine, denouncing Europe’s plans to increase defense spending in the wake of Russia’s military offensive.A new way to balance world power must be found, he said, arguing that more of the same was just “madness” and stating he was “embarrassed” when he learned European nations had committed to spending 2% of GDP on buying more weapons. He has also criticized “unjustified aggression” without naming the culprit.“A different way of governing the globalized world, not by showing your teeth, as is done now, but a different way to frame international relations” must be found, he insisted."

It has already led to a global economic crisis stemming from disruptions in supply chains and rising energy prices. And although the beginning of the hostilities came as a surprise to the whole world, the current state of affairs was not unpredictable – international relations experts have been warning about the risk of this escalation for the past 30 years.Why didn’t politicians in the West listen to their advice, instead of allowing war to break out in Europe, and fuel and food prices to skyrocket at home? RT explains.“I want to make it clear to everyone, both in our country and abroad, to our partners, that it’s not even about the line that we don’t want anyone to cross. The fact is that we have nowhere to retreat. They have pinned us against a line from which, sorry for the bad manners, we have nowhere to retreat,” President Vladimir Putin stated at the end of December 2021, almost two months before he ordered the assault on Ukraine. At the time, Moscow was trying to come to an agreement with NATO on mutual security, hoping that the US-led bloc would agree to provide comprehensive written guarantees that it would not expand any further, to the east. Not only Putin, but also other Russian officials, talked about ‘red lines’ that posed a serious threat, with ominous consequences for the world, if crossed.The existence of these red lines – most notably against NATO expansion into Ukraine – is not some subjective concept born in the minds of Russia’s current leadership. Oddly enough, they were being discussed in the West long before they became the subject of conversation in the Kremlin. In 1998, George Kennan, an American diplomat and historian known as the ‘architect of the Cold War’, said NATO expansion would mean nothing less than “the beginning of a new Cold War,” warning that it would be a “tragic mistake.” “Of course, this will provoke a bad reaction from Russia. And when that happens, [those who made decisions about NATO expansion] will say that we have always told you the Russians are like that. But it’s just not true,” he said.In 1997, 50 prominent foreign policy experts, including former senators, military leaders, and diplomats, sent an open letter to then-President Bill Clinton outlining their opposition to NATO expansion. “It is a policy error of historic proportions,” they wrote.Conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan wrote in his 1999 book ‘A Republic, Not an Empire’, “By moving NATO onto Russia’s front porch, we have scheduled a twenty-first-century confrontation.”The current director of the CIA, William Burns, said in 2008 that for Russia, “Ukraine’s accession to NATO is the brightest of all red lines.”“I have not yet found anyone who would consider Ukraine in NATO as something other than a direct challenge to Russia’s interests,” he said.These are just some of the statements made by major American political figures, but it would be possible to compile an entire book from forecasts made in the 1990s alone. And after the Ukraine crisis began in 2014, and Russia’s subsequent reabsorption of Crimea, opinions about the folly of further NATO expansion were heard more and more often in the West. Over the past eight years, former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, Henry Kissinger, famed American scholar of Russian studies Stephen Cohen, and many other experts have issued warnings about NATO expansion.The decisions made by Western government officials over the past 20-25 years have clearly contradicted the recommendations of these experts. Timofei Bordachev, the program director of the Valdai International Discussion Club and academic director of the Center for Integrated European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, believes the reason for this is obvious – politicians listen to experts, but don’t consider it necessary to follow their recommendations.“In an area like international relations, politicians, unfortunately, almost never listen to the expert community. The reason for this is understandable. The task of the expert community is to achieve peace and prevent conflict. But since politicians answer to the voters, they always work to achieve victory at any cost,” Bordachev said in a conversation with RT.“The difference in approach is obvious. Therefore, it is very difficult for politicians to listen to the opinion of experts. In achieving their goals, they bluff to the last,” he added.This hypothesis is most clearly confirmed in an interview with the adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Alexey Arestovich, which was given to the Apostrophe TV YouTube channel in 2019. At the time, he not only accurately predicted the year war would break out in his country and the reasons behind it, but also asserted that conflict was inevitable, indicating that it was necessary for Ukraine:“With a 99.9% probability, our price of joining NATO is a big war with Russia... The optimal outcome is a major war with Russia and a transition to NATO based on the results of victory over Russia.”These words suggest that Ukraine’s leadership was not intent on preventing war at all. On the contrary, the country was preparing for war, believing it was a justifiable means of achieving ‘victory’ – joining NATO.However, this does not explain why American, or at least European, politicians did not try to prevent the war in Europe. According to Bordachev, the fact is that Western leaders proceeded from the assumption that there was no way their countries could join the war.“Given the existence of nuclear deterrence, everyone understands the risk of a general destructive war is very easily separated from all other risks: it is easy to localize and prevent. We can see this now from the behavior of the United States and its allies, who are taking all measures against Russia short of direct intervention in the conflict. That is, they very confidently exclude from the equation a scenario that would pose a danger to themselves – they are not suicidal. But Western politicians do not care at all about how many Ukrainians must die in order for them to achieve their goals,” Bordachev said.Dmitry Suslov, the deputy director for research at the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy (CFDP) and deputy director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies of the Faculty of World Economy and International Affairs of the National Research University – Higher School of Economics (NRU HSE), believes there is a different reason why the actions of politicians deviate so much from what the expert community prescribes.It’s not that Western politicians refuse to listen to foreign policy analysts – they listen to the wrong ones.“There was no unity among the experts in the West, no consensus at all. It was mainly the foreign policy realists from the US and Europe that had warned about the dangers of expanding NATO. The problem was, after the end of the Cold War, the realists’ influence in the Western foreign policy establishment has diminished significantly,” Suslov told RT.According to him, once the Cold War ended, the liberal viewpoint quickly gained popularity among Western expert circles and policymakers. “The idea was, first off, that Russia was in a state of impending and irreversible decline, and that it wouldn’t dare challenge the West in any shape or form. It was believed that Russia would eventually fall in line and join the ‘right side of history’ (from the West’s point of view), would fit into the NATO-centric paradigm in Europe and take on a subordinate position on the sidelines of global politics. This was the vision espoused by liberals and neoconservatives, and it clearly dominated over the realists’ position,” he said.This only seemed natural. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many had the feeling that the balance of power and the previous patterns of international relations suddenly became obsolete. Now, they thought, everything would be different – international relations would be guided by a brand-new set of considerations, while those of the realists, along with their notions of geopolitics, would fade away into obscurity.The ‘end of history’, a concept advocated by Francis Fukuyama in the 1990s, gained a lot of traction during this period. It is well known that Fukuyama’s interpretation of this idea had a powerful influence on George W. Bush and his foreign policy. In his book titled ‘The End of History and the Last Man’, he announced that the age of ideological confrontation, authoritarianism, revolutions, and war was finally over, as all states would eventually embrace liberal democracy modeled after the United States.Fukuyama is now making predictions about the outcome of the current conflict in Ukraine. He believes that military defeat for Russia in Ukraine is imminent and will result in China not daring to invade Taiwan. This, according to Fukuyama, will revive the spirit of 1989, which will capture people’s hearts and bring the world back to the path towards the ‘end of history’.Truth be told, Russia gave Western politicians reasons to doubt the assessments of realist experts. “In the 1990s and even early 2000s, Russia appeared weak. It didn’t stand determinately and clearly enough against expansion of NATO; moreover, it made the expansion even easier to some extent,” Suslov said.In his opinion, the very existence of the Founding Act signed in 1997 convinced the West that Moscow was ready to turn a blind eye to NATO expansion. This document determined Russia-NATO relations over the past 25 years, until the start of Russia’s attack on Ukraine. It reaffirmed the commitment of the parties to the inherent right of European nations “to choose the means to ensure their own security.” For years, this formula was used by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to explain why Russia did not have a say in Georgia or Ukraine joining the alliance.“Indeed, Russia had secured several important provisions in that document, but at the same time, it gave a signal that a deal on expansion is possible. In general, the act showed Russia wouldn’t wage war against NATO or acceding states,” Suslov said.The Founding Act gave the alliance legal grounds for admitting new members, but what really assured Western politicians that Russia was ready to allow expansion was the accession of the former Soviet republics of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.Curiously enough, when this discussion was just beginning in 1997, Joe Biden, then-chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, argued that Russia could go along with NATO accepting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into the military bloc, but the Baltic states were where it would draw the line. “I think the one place where the greatest consternation would be caused in the short-term would be to admit the Baltic states now,” the future US president said.In the end, the Baltic states were admitted into the alliance. They received invitations in 2002, and in 2004 became full members. “How did Russia react? It did nothing again. It really stood up against expansion only when NATO tried to extend to Georgia and Ukraine. That’s why we ended up where we are now,” Suslov said.Reality has clearly changed. The current dynamics of relations between Russia and the West leaves no ambiguity about NATO’s potential advance toward Russia’s borders.According to Suslov, this, along with other trends observed in contemporary international relations, will strengthen the position of the realists.“There is no doubt we are now witnessing a resurgence of the realist school. This has to do not only with the conflict in Ukraine, but also with the confrontation between the US and China. Once again, we see that the shifts in the balance of power on the globe are the single most important factor – it is what sets everything in motion and shapes the international system. It is a new shift in the balance of global powers that dictates the state of relations between nations: China has become too strong, and the US is trying to contain it,” he said.Suslov argues that the current patterns in US-China relations “spell doom for the liberals and hold a lot of promise for realists. It is quite likely that, in the near future, Western politicians will start making decisions based on advice from the latter and not the former. If so, then what do the realists propose as their solution to the ongoing conflict in Europe?""“The realists argue that the US should recognize Ukraine’s geopolitical losses as ‘status quo’, stop supplying Kiev with lethal weapons and even pressure Zelensky into signing a deal with Moscow under which Ukraine would remain independent but neutral.”Following these recommendations would help the US solve two important problems, Suslov said. First of all, Washington could stop further Russia-China rapprochement unfavorable to the US. Secondly, it would de-escalate US-Russia tensions by preventing direct military confrontation between the nations.“Realists believe this kind of confrontation is on the table if Washington continues the economic war against Moscow,” he said.   In any case, it’s too early to dismiss negative scenarios as unlikely and trust in the good judgment of politicians. According to Bordachev, “Not once in the history of humankind have politicians listened to experts. And there are no hints this could change today.”"

Names of US officials involved in the biolabs projects, and the role the current US president’s son played in the program, were also made public during the special briefing on Thursday.One of the key pieces of evidence was a letter from the Ukrainian company Motor Sich to the  Turkish drone manufacturer Baykar Makina – makers of the Bayraktar TB2 and Akinci UAVs – dated December 15, 2021. The Ukrainians specifically asked if the drones could carry 20 liters of aerosolized payload to a range of 300 kilometers – putting them in range of a dozen major Russian cities and almost all of Belarus. “We are talking about the development by the Kiev regime of technical means of delivery and use of biological weapons with the possibility of their use against the Russian Federation,” said Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, commander of the Russian Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Forces.Kirillov also referenced a US patent (No. 8,967,029) for a mechanism to deploy aerosolized pathogens from a drone. The US response to a 2018 Russian inquiry about this patent did not deny its existence, but claimed that it technically did not violate Washington’s obligations under the treaties banning chemical and biological weapons, he pointed out.Kirillov showed signed contracts between US government agencies – Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the Pentagon, the Department of State – and the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, as well as the specific facilities inside Ukraine. The Pentagon spent more than $30 million for biological research at just one Ukrainian facility, the Public Health Center of the Ministry of Health, according to the Russian military.DTRA official Robert Pope was “one of the key figures” in the program, and “the author of the idea of creating a central depository of especially dangerous microorganisms in Kiev,” Kirillov said. The Pentagon’s biological projects in Ukraine were coordinated by Joanna Wintrol, head of the DTRA office in Kiev, until she left in August 2020. She directly supervised projects UP-4, UP-6, and UP-8 to study deadly pathogens, including anthrax, the Congo-Crimean fever, and leptospirosis, according to Kirillov.The US agency’s point of contact was Ukraine’s Health Minister (2016-2019) Ulyana Suprun, herself a US citizen, Kirillov noted, while a major go-between was the private contractor Black and Veatch, whose Kiev office was headed by Lance Lippencott. Another Pentagon contractor, Metabiota, also had a role in the project.Kirillov said that Hunter Biden – son of the current US President Joe Biden – played “an important role in creating a financial opportunity to work with pathogens on the territory of Ukraine,” pointing to several emails between him and executives of Metabiota and Black and Veatch. In particular, he described the Metabiota VP as “a confidant of Hunter Biden,” based on  their correspondence. According to the general, the “Western media” has confirmed the authenticity of these emails – presumably a reference to materials published last week by the British newspaper the Daily Mail.Even Kiev was concerned about the biolabs, according to a memo Kirillov showed. A 2017 letter from the Kherson department of the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) said that DTRA and Black and Veach intend to “establish control over the functioning of microbiological laboratories in Ukraine conducting research on pathogens of particularly dangerous infections that can be used to create or modernize new types of biological weapons.”Pointing to a June 2019 document from the Public Health Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, Kirillov wondered why it insisted on secrecy and required that “serious” incidents “including the death of the subjects” had to be reported to the US bioethics authorities within 24 hours – when other documents about that specific program only reference standard blood sampling work.“We do not exclude that the official research program is only the ‘visible part of the iceberg’, while in practice, volunteers were infected with the Congo–Crimean fever virus, hantaviruses and the causative agent of leptospirosis,” the general said, accusing the US of “a dismissive attitude towards the citizens of Ukraine,” and treating them as guinea pigs for biological and medical experimentation.The US has long claimed that allegations about Pentagon-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine were “Russian disinformation.” Earlier this month, however, US diplomat Victoria Nuland testified before the Senate that “biological research laboratories in Ukraine” did exist, and that Washington was working with Kiev “to ensure that the materials of biological research do not fall into the hands of Russian forces.”According to Kirillov, all pathogenic biomaterials stored in Ukraine were “transported by military transport aircraft to the United States via Odessa,” in early February 2022. On February 24, as Russian troops entered Ukraine, the ministry of health in Kiev ordered the remaining strains to be destroyed, the general said.Kirillov said that the Russian intervention halted activities at five Ukrainian biolabs that had been working with anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, cholera, leptospirosis, and African swine fever."
