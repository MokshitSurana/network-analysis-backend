0,next plague outbreak in madagascar could be  tronger  who n ngeneva  the world health organisation chief on wednesday said a deadly plague epidemic appeared to have been brought under control in madagascar but warned the next outbreak would likely be stronger n nthe next transmission could be more pronounced or stronger who directorgeneral tedros adhanom ghebreyesus told reporters in geneva insisting that the issue is serious n nan outbreak of both bubonic plague which is spread by infected rats via flea bites and pneumonic plague spread person to person has killed more than 200 people in the indian ocean island nation since august n nmadagascar has suffered bubonic plague outbreaks almost every year since 1980 often caused by rats fleeing forest fires n nthe disease tends to make a comeback each hot rainy season from september to april non average between 300 and 600 infections are recorded every year among a population approaching 25 million people according to a un estimate n nbut tedros voiced alarm that plague in madagascar behaved in a very very different way this year n ncases sprang up far earlier than usual and instead of being confined to the countryside the disease infiltrated towns nthe authorities recorded more than 2 000 cases and tedros said wednesday the death toll stood at 207 n nhe also pointed to the presence of the pneumonic version which spreads more easily and is more virulent in the latest outbreak n nhe praised the rapid response from who and madagascar authorities that helped bring the outbreak under control but warned that the danger was not over n nthe largerthanusual outbreak had helped spread the bacteria that causes the plague more widely n nthis along with poor sanitation and vector control on madagascar meant that when the plague comes again it starts from more stock and the magnitude in the next transmission could be higher than the one that we saw tedros said n nthat means that madagascar could be affected more and not only that it could even spill over into neighbouring countries and beyond he warned n ncomplicating vector control is the fact that the fleas that carry the yersinia pestis bacteria that causes the plague have proven to be widely resistant to chemicals and insecticides n nthat  a dangerous combination tedros said n,"['appeal_to_authority', 'repetition', 'doubt', 'appeal_to_fear', 'prejudice']"

2,kate steinle  death at the hands of a mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate xe2 x80 x94 here  the story behind her killing n nthe surprise acquittal of jose ines garcia zarate in the shooting death of san francisco woman kate steinle set off a firestorm of outrage thursday night as top conservatives and critics of socalled sanctuary cities pinned blame for steinle  death on illegal immigration and insufficiently aggressive deportation policies n ngarcia zarate a 45yearold mexican national who was homeless and living in the us illegally when he fired the shot that killed steinle was acquitted by a jury on murder and manslaughter charges nthe jury convicted him of the lesser charge of being a felon in possession of a gun which carries a maximum sentence of three years in state prison n nsteinle 32 was fatally shot while she walked along pier 14 of the san francisco bay with her father in july 2015 nthe bullet that pierced her back had ricocheted off the concrete ground after it was fired by garcia zarate from a handgun belonging to a federal ranger that had been stolen four days earlier n ngarcia zarate  defense attorneys argued that the shooting was an accident xe2 x80 x94 they said he found the gun wrapped in a tshirt or cloth under a pier bench and unintentionally discharged it nlead attorney matt gonzalez has argued that the weapon was a sig sauer with a hair trigger in singleaction mode xe2 x80 x94 a model wellknown for accidental discharges even among experienced shooters ngonzalez told the jury according to the san francisco chronicle that garcia zarate had never handled a firearm before was frightened by the noise of the gunshot then flung the weapon into the bay where it was later found by a diver n nprosecutors however alleged that garcia zarate brought the weapon to the pier deliberately to do harm and intentionally aimed and shot steinle after firmly pulling the trigger nthey said garcia zarate then threw the weapon into the bay and fled the scene n nbeyond the shooting itself perhaps the most controversial aspect of garcia zarate  case involves his previous criminal activity and history of deportations and how san francisco and federal authorities handled his custody before he ever picked up the gun and shot steinle nat the time of steinle  death garcia zarate had been convicted of nonviolent drug crimes and deported five times since the early 1990s n nhe faced a sixth deportation in 2015 and was in justice department doj custody that march after serving 46 months in prison for a felony reentry into the us but instead of transferring him into the custody of immigration and customs enforcement ice for deportation the department transferred him to the san francisco county jail for prosecution of a 1995 marijuana charge n nsan francisco prosecutors who had long ago deprioritized marijuana charges dismissed the decadesold charge and released garcia zarate on april 15 2015 ndue to san francisco  policy of limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities xe2 x80 x94 which some refer to as a sanctuary policy xe2 x80 x94 the city did not inform ice when they released garcia zarate n nas a result of the case both the doj and the city of san francisco have changed several policies nthe doj announced in 2016 it would no longer release potentially deportable detainees to local jails without first allowing ice to take custody nsan francisco meanwhile has adjusted its policy to notify ice if they are releasing suspected undocumented immigrants who face charges of serious or violent felonies n nthis tragedy could have been prevented if san francisco had simply turned the alien over to ice as we requested instead of releasing him back onto the streets ice director thomas homan said in a statement on thursday nit is unconscionable that politicians across this country continue to endanger the lives of americans with sanctuary policies while ignoring the harm inflicted on their constituents n nbut ice has faced criticism of its own over not seeking a judicial warrant to legally obtain custody of garcia zarate when it discovered he had been transferred into san francisco  custody nthe agency has argued that obtaining judicial warrants are unnecessary and would place too much burden on ice officials and federal courts n nthough the agency did issue a request to the city to detain garcia zarate until ice officials could pick him up their detainer requests are not signed by a judge and are therefore not legally binding nsan francisco  policy is to ignore such requests if they are not accompanied by judgesigned warrants and the city has cited federal court cases concluding that such detentions violate inmates  fourth amendment rights n ngarcia zarate  deportation and criminal history made him an effective target for immigration hardliners who argued that steinle would still be alive were it not for an insecure border and lenient treatment toward suspected undocumented immigrants in local jails npresident donald trump immediately seized on the verdict on thursday as evidence of the perils of illegal immigration ntrump frequently villainized garcia zarate and cited steinle  death during his presidential campaign using the case to bolster his argument for a border wall and aid his crusade against sanctuary cities n nearly on friday trump also falsely claimed on twitter that garcia zarate had previously committed violent crimes and had illegally entered the us six times due to lax border security under the obama administration n nthe kate steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected obama border always committing crimes and being violent and yet this info was not used in court nhis exoneration is a complete travesty of justice nbuild the wall ntrump tweeted n nin fact garcia zarate had never been convicted of a violent crime before steinle  shooting xe2 x80 x94 his previous convictions were for nonviolent drug crimes and illegal entry nlax border security too does not appear to be a factor since garcia zarate was caught by border patrol agents each time he entered the country under the obama administration n nin contrast steinle  family has expressed nuanced views on immigration and sanctuary policies nthey have both condemned trump for sensationalizing steinle  death to advance antiimmigration policies and expressed frustration with san francisco officials who they believe went too far in refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities n,"['loaded_language', 'slogans',

7,kavanaugh nomination is exploding in trump xe2 x80 x99s face n nthe president is doubling down on an increasingly risky candidate njustice anthony kennedy gave president donald trump the biggest political gift possible when he announced his resignation in the spring neven though not everything that xe2 x80 x99s gone wrong is trump xe2 x80 x99s fault he has managed to make a complete hash of brett kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s nomination to fill the empty seat on the court nit xe2 x80 x99s a good example of how badly trump does his job more than a year and a half into his administration n nto begin with trump has outsourced his judicial nominations to outside partyaligned groups the heritage foundation and the federalist society nthat included an unusually central role for the federalist society xe2 x80 x99s leonard leo n nthat wasn xe2 x80 x99t entirely a trump mistake nhis decision during the campaign to release a list of potential justices drafted by leo reflected the realitytv star xe2 x80 x99s weakness as a presidential candidate nthe party was worried that trump might turn out not to be a conservative to reassure them he publicly committed to their top goal nin some ways that xe2 x80 x99s successful coalitionbuilding and what he xe2 x80 x99s done in office is just keeping his promises on judges n nstill it xe2 x80 x99s one thing to form an alliance with conservatives it xe2 x80 x99s another to turn the whole process over to them nwe don xe2 x80 x99t know to what extent kavanaugh was trump xe2 x80 x99s choice and to what extent he was manipulated into choosing him nwe have plenty of evidence that trump is easily manipulated by those around him and that kavanaugh is a good fit for trump xe2 x80 x99s biases the judge has ivy league credentials and he passes trump xe2 x80 x99s cutofhisjib test by looking the part n1 n neither way kavanaugh was a poor choice from the point of view of good presidenting nthe judge was certain to be a highly controversial selection from the start nafter all he had been a highly controversial selection for his current circuit court seat eventually getting confirmed with only four democratic votes after a long delay nkavanaugh is a longtime republican operative a hardliner during both the vince foster and monica lewinsky investigations nnominating him rather than a conservative with similar views but a different background was bound to stir up trouble nit was also true as senate majority leader mitch mcconnell reportedly warned that normal disclosure of kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s record especially his service during the george w bush administration was going to delay confirmation even more nsenate republicans dealt with that problem by deciding to not bother with any kavanaugh documents that couldn xe2 x80 x99t be produced rapidly which further riled up the democrats and gave that party some good talking points n2 n n nsometimes it xe2 x80 x99s worth taking risks npresidents who shy away from anything that xe2 x80 x99s not a sure thing can fail to exploit opportunities nit xe2 x80 x99s just very hard to see any upside for trump in choosing kavanaugh instead of a safer but still very conservative other option n3 n nwhen serious charges of sexual misconduct were raised against kavanaugh trump decided to stick with him instead of moving on to another candidate nit xe2 x80 x99s still not clear that kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s nomination is doomed but it xe2 x80 x99s certainly in severe trouble nlosing a highprofile fight is always going to hurt a president which is why they should take care to avoid highrisk lowreward conflicts nbut there xe2 x80 x99s an art to minimizing damage nand trump hasn xe2 x80 x99t learned it yet n nfor one thing the president has made this an extremely highprofile episode by stringing out the process as the accusations against kavanaugh gained credibility and even multiplied nwhether that matters in terms of public opinion for trump is unclear but it certainly isn xe2 x80 x99t good for any republican senators caught up in the middle along with any other candidates who have had to weigh in only to find the facts as they knew them constantly changing n nit xe2 x80 x99s also the case that the more negative information comes out the more it appears that the trump and his white house staff failed to do their jobs in vetting and managing kavanaugh nif the nomination had been pulled right after christine blasey ford made her initial assertions about kavanaugh the public might have concluded that it wasn xe2 x80 x99t trump xe2 x80 x99s fault that a previously unaired accusation came to light n nmeanwhile trump xe2 x80 x99s behavior has been as erratic as ever nfirst he said that brasey had to be heard then he attacked her in terms that were a slur on all women who have been assaulted without immediately reporting it to the police and he also blamed the senate for not voting before she came forward nhe sometimes praises kavanaugh but also let it be known that he thought the nominee had performed badly in his fox news interview nthe white house demanded a final up and down vote on tuesday by wednesday he was saying that the nomination would die if kavanaugh didn xe2 x80 x99t do well before the judiciary committee on thursday nthe sum of all this has been as in many other episodes that trump and his white house are a gang that can xe2 x80 x99t shoot straight and that he xe2 x80 x99s eager to blame his allies and lash out at his enemies in ugly ways when things go wrong n na botched nomination matters because allies will be less likely to trust trump not just on supreme court choices but on any initiative nand for that matter they xe2 x80 x99ll be less likely to trust him when he asserts that there xe2 x80 x99s nothing remaining for special counsel robert mueller to reveal ntrump xe2 x80 x99s professional reputation is already terrible but everything counts nas the political scientist richard neustadt said political elites are constantly evaluating and reevaluating the president ntrump is hurting himself right now and will have hurt himself more if kavanaugh is not confirmed n nand yes i call it the cutofhisjib test quite deliberately nit no surprise that someone who hires based on what he thinks someone doing that job should look like which seems to be based on hazy oldtime hollywood casting would wind up with fewer women in his administration than any of his recent predecessors n nive argued that too much disclosure is required and that democrats and any wavering republicans had more than enough information to make up their mind ni still think that true nbut it did leave republicans vulnerable to claims about transparency which were likely to be popular  most people and the entire press corps love transparency  and vulnerable to bombshells in the documentary record which hadnt been initially disclosed nin the event that not what causing the trouble but still it an example of trump taking needless risks n nsome have speculated that kavanaugh would be especially likely to rule in trump favor if any cases stemming from the robert mueller investigation wind up at the high court nperhaps nthere are plenty of other partisan conservative judges and plenty of conservative judges who lean towards an expansive view of presidential powers nand if kavanaugh is really an outlier on that issue then he wont be in the majority on any future decision anyway nso no i dont think there any good reason to think kavanaugh would be especially helpful to trump compared to others he could have selected

tuesday with fulsome declarations of a new friendship but just vague pledges of nuclear disarmament n nfor trump that amounted to a triumphant outcome in his extraordinary gamble with the rogue kingdom  despotic leader nbut there were scant details on what new commitments had been secured from kim even as trump announced he would end the regular military exercises the us conducts with south korea nwhether nuclear disarmament is indeed the final outcome of tuesday  summit won t be known for years if not decades nbut the dramatic act of extending his hand to one of america  longtime adversaries will forever illustrate trump  gutdriven normshattering tenure nwe both want to do something nwe both are going to do something nand we have developed a very special bond trump said at the conclusion of the landmark summit npeople are going to be very impressed npeople are going to be very happy nthe document he and kim signed said the north korean leader reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula nin exchange trump agreed to provide security guarantees to north korea nbut there was no mentioning the previous us aim of complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearization nand kim  commitments did not appear to go beyond what he already pledged to do in april when he met south korean president moon jaein along their countries  border ntrump insisted during a news conference the agreement went further than many people expected nbut he acknowledged the effort to rid north korea of its nuclear arsenal was in its early stages nwe will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done he said nmore critical in trump  telling was the development of a personal bond with kim a brutal dictator responsible for the deaths not only of his own citizens but of at least one american otto warmbier who was returned to the us in a coma only to die days later ni think our whole relationship with north korea and the korean peninsula is going to be a very much different situation than it has in the past trump said during the summit nlater during his news conference trump said warmbier  death contributed to the summit taking place nwithout otto this would not have happened trump said ntrump and kim  both intent on making history  greeted each other early in the day with extended hands in front of a row of us and north korean flags a previously unthinkable sight that reflects a new chapter in the two countries  acrimonious relationship ntrump  threats to politely walk out of the meeting if his expectations were unmet did not materialize ninstead he predicted he could solve a big problem a big dilemma alongside his new partner nworking together we ll get it taken care of trump said nthe remarks came amid an improbable series of events that few could have anticipated even three months ago nthe unlikely images of us and north korean counterparts engaging in friendly dialogue lent the day an air of unreality nin a detailed menu the white house said the men were served h xc3 xa4agendazs vanilla ice cream for dessert nother unforeseen events also surrounded the summit increasing the drama nminutes before the historic handshake trump tweeted that his top economic adviser larry kudlow had suffered a heart attack nimmediately after the encounter dennis rodman  one of the only americans to have met kim  was openly weeping while being interviewed by cnn  chris cuomo neven kim seemed to acknowledge the surreality of the day nmany people in the world will think of this as a inaudible form of fantasy  from a science fiction movie his translator was overheard saying as the two leaders walked down a whitecolumned colonnade nat the conclusion of the summit trump hailed the talks as a historic and personal achievement nwe learned a lot about each other and our countries trump said ni learned he  a very talented man nwhen pressed about those comments in light of kim  brutal tactics trump continued praising the north korean leaders  ability to run a country at a young age nhe is very talented trump said citing kim  ability to take over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and run it and run it tough nkim assumed power after his father kim jong il also a brutal dictator died in 2011 nthroughout the day trump and kim  body language was openly friendly a striking warmth given kim  iron grip on power and dismal record on human rights ntrump  move to meet him attracted fierce criticism for normalizing a regime routinely called out for its human rights abuses that over years has built an image of fearsome renegade regime throwing around threats of nuclear war nthe day began with trump patting kim on the back and placing his hand on the north korean  shoulder as they walked into their first meeting nlater they were seen smiling and laughing over lunch ntrump told reporters he would absolutely extend an invitation to the white house to kim who also heralded a new era ntoday we had a historic meeting and decided to leave the past behind kim said through a translator nthe world will see a major change nthe meeting came only months after the two men traded nuclear taunts ratcheting up tensions and leading to fears of war nby contrast trump appeared to back off a military footing on tuesday declaring the us will stop the war games an apparent reference to joint military exercises with south korea that north korea has long rebuked as provocative ntrump also said he hopes to eventually withdraw us forces from south korea but said that  not part of the equation right now ni want to get our soldiers out ni want to bring our soldiers back home trump said nbut that  not part of the equation right now ni hope it will be eventually ntuesday  meeting convened at a luxury hotel on the island of sentosa came just three months after trump accepted north korea  invitation for talks on the spot nit was an extraordinarily compressed timeline for the landmark summit which at one point was called off entirely as communication broke down between washington and pyongyang nthe talks were quickly revived leading to the highly choreographed event that unfolded tuesday nafter the men shook hands they repaired inside for oneonone talks nin that first meeting they were joined only by translators a break from standard practice of having at least one aide present for highstakes huddles nlater in the day advisers joined the talks for a larger bilateral session and a working lunch ntrump took keen interest in the pageantry of the day insisting the pictures beamed around the world reflect a commanding leader making a decisive worldaltering move nat the same time he d admitted he didn t believe he required extensive preparation to take stock of kim nas part of the advance work trump commissioned a highly produced video meant to convince kim to relinquish his weapons and open his country to outside investment ntrump showed kim the movie on an ipad during their talks nhere in futuristic singapore however kim was able to view the benefits of economic advancement at close range nhe was spotted taking a moonlit stroll around the highend marina bay sands

17,wait nwait nit xe2 x80 x99s all a mistranslation n nthus it took more than a yearandahalf for the factory to roll out the old reliable xe2 x80 x9cmistranslation xe2 x80 x9d defense to explain away the infamous paragraph 303 of amoris laetita al which reads as follows in the official english translation on the vatican website nyet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the gospel nit can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to god and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what god himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one xe2 x80 x99s limits while yet not fully the objective ideal nin other words the conscience can xe2 x80 x9cinform xe2 x80 x9d a sinner that his continued sinning is not only acceptable to god but is even what god is asking xe2 x80 x9cfor now xe2 x80 x9d given one xe2 x80 x99s particular xe2 x80 x9climits xe2 x80 x9d this outrageous proposition a form of situation ethics that strikes at the very foundation of catholic moral teaching has justly provoked a storm of criticism from lay and clerical defenders of the authentic magisterium n nbut it xe2 x80 x99s all a misunderstanding say dr robert fastiggi professor of systematic theology at sacred heart major seminary and dr ndawn eden goldstein std professor of dogmatic theology at holy apostles college and seminary nall of the critics of al are wrong xe2 x80 x94every one of them xe2 x80 x94because you see the original latin text does not say what the english text does ndr robert fastiggi and dr ndawn goldstein nhere we go again nso what does the latin say nhere is the paragraph in the official latin nhaec autem conscientia agnoscere potest non modo statum quendam ab universali evangelii mandato obiective dissidere etiam sincere honesteque agnoscere poteste quod sit liberale responsum in praesenti deo reddendum atque eadem conscientia firma quadam morali certitudine intellegere illam esse oblationem quam ipse deus requirit inter rerum impedientium congeriem quamvis perfectum nondum sit obiectivum exemplar nyes and so what nwell according to fastiggi and goldstein while the english translation reads xe2 x80 x9cwhat for now is the most generous response which can be given to god xe2 x80 x9d the latin employs the word oblationem which means offering nso what the pope really means xc2 xae is xe2 x80 x9cwhat for now is the most generous offering which can be given to god xe2 x80 x9d so it xe2 x80 x99s an offering to god not a response to god nbig difference n nbut just a moment how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an xe2 x80 x9coffering xe2 x80 x9d to god nit would seem the latin version has graver implications than the english because it suggests that falling short of what the moral law requires is an oblation pleasing to god if one xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9climits xe2 x80 x9d make obedience to the moral law difficult nand that is exactly the nonsense fastiggi and goldstein expect us to swallow xe2 x80 x9cpope francis is not talking about an offering of an objectively sinful action but a gift of self that moves toward god and the objective moral norm xe2 x80 x9d n nso our intrepid presenters of what the pope really means xc2 xae would have us believe that objectively immoral behavior which is the best one can do according xe2 x80 x9cthe xe2 x80 x9cconcrete complexity of one xe2 x80 x99s limits xe2 x80 x9d is no longer simply objectively immoral behavior but rather a gift of self because it moves toward morally licit behavior nfastiggi and goldstein have managed to make the problem even worse in their attempt to explain it away n nwhat about the english locution xe2 x80 x9cwhile yet not fully the objective ideal xe2 x80 x9d which seems to reduce the negative precepts of the natural law to mere ideals nnot so fastiggi and goldstein contend ndo not all those ignorant critics of al know that the latin text employs the phrase xe2 x80 x9cobiectivum exemplar xe2 x80 x9d which translated literally into english is xe2 x80 x9cobjective exemplar xe2 x80 x9d they declare triumphantly xe2 x80 x9cthe latin term exemplar does not mean an unattainable ideal it specifically means a pattern or model to follow xe2 x80 x9d n ngive nme na nbreak na pattern or model to follow is an ideal as a standard latin dictionary confirms with its definition of exemplar xe2 x80 x9c1 copyreproduction 2 model pattern example original ideal nlikewise the definition of the english word xe2 x80 x9cexemplar xe2 x80 x9d is simply xe2 x80 x9can ideal model xe2 x80 x9d n nhere too fastiggi and goldsetein only worsen the problem they try to explain away nfor if moral behavior is now to be viewed as merely xe2 x80 x9cexemplary xe2 x80 x9d rather than divinely mandated by the natural law that binds all men xe2 x80 x94including thou shalt not commit adultery xe2 x80 x94then basic morality becomes a kind of heroic virtue nthus continence cannot realistically be expected at least xe2 x80 x9cfor now xe2 x80 x9d al 303 of the average joe or jane with an xe2 x80 x9cex xe2 x80 x9d who has xe2 x80 x9cremarried xe2 x80 x9d and is now mired in the xe2 x80 x9cconcrete complexity one xe2 x80 x99s limits xe2 x80 x9d n nso as fastiggi and goldstein would have it all the tumult triggered by al is just a misunderstanding caused by uninformed people who haven xe2 x80 x99t consulted the latin text xe2 x80 x94including those ignorant vatican translators naccording to their proposed xe2 x80 x9calternate translation xe2 x80 x9d into english what the pope really means xc2 xae is that objectively immoral behavior one feels unable to correct due to one xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9climits xe2 x80 x9d is xe2 x80 x9cthe offering that god himself is asking amid the mass of impediments although it may not yet be the perfect objective model xe2 x80 x9d which is what the official english translation already says but with fewer words n nit seems fastiggi and goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning but only an intensification of its perniciousness nindeed their xe2 x80 x9cproposed alternate translation xe2 x80 x9d reduces the avoidance of adulterous relations in xe2 x80 x9csecond marriages xe2 x80 x9d to the xe2 x80 x9cperfect objective model xe2 x80 x9d now how could anyone but a pharisee expect perfection from people living in adultery nare you perfect nthen again the pharisees are precisely the ones our lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law nbut such embarrassing truths need not impede the bergoglian mercy train as it barrels toward a train wreck at the end of the line nand fastiggi and goldstein are busily helping it along changing red signals to green nno problem here nhas been the mantra of the neocatholic establishment for nearly half a century of ecclesial autodemolition n nbut wait there xe2 x80 x99s more nour dynamic translators even provide their own dynamic interpretation of al to mean that the xe2 x80 x9coffering xe2 x80 x9d to god of which francis speaks is merely the decision by a divorced and xe2 x80 x9cremarried xe2 x80 x9d couple with children not to end their relationship which would be the xe2 x80 x9cperfect objective model xe2 x80 x9d but rather to xe2 x80 x9clive in continence until they may xe2 x80 x94after the hoped for declaration of nullity xe2 x80 x94enter into a true marriage xe2 x80 x9d that is they would have francis affirming john paul ii xe2 x80 x99s familiaris consortio which repeats the church xe2 x80 x99s constant teaching that continence is required of those who have entered into adulterous xe2 x80 x9csecond marriage xe2 x80 x9d failing which they cannot be admitted to the sacraments n nbut the fastiggigoldstein interpretation is precisely the contrary of the interpretation francis has assiduously promoted and which fastiggi and goldstein just as assiduously ignore ie that people in xe2 x80 x9csecond marriages xe2 x80 x9d do not have to live in continence but rather xe2 x80 x94in xe2 x80 x9ccertain cases xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x94may continue their adulterous relations while receiving absolution and holy communion during a xe2 x80 x9cprocess of discernment xe2 x80 x9d as we know in his letter to the bishops of buenos aires published on the vatican website in response to a query he himself may have solicited bergoglio informed them xe2 x80 x9cthere is no other interpretation xe2 x80 x9d n nmoreover the maltese bishops xe2 x80 x9cguidelines xe2 x80 x9d for implementing al published in l xe2 x80 x99osservatore romano xe2 x80 x94for which bergoglio thanked them xe2 x80 x94declare thus nif as a result of the process of discernment undertaken with xe2 x80 x9chumility discretion and love for the church and her teaching in a sincere search for god xe2 x80 x99s will and a desire to make a more perfect response to it xe2 x80 x9d al 300 a separated or divorced person who is living in a new relationship manages with an informed and enlightened conscience to acknowledge and believe that he or she are at peace with god he or she cannot be precluded from participating in the sacraments of reconciliation and the eucharist see al notes 336 and 351 nthis pope xe2 x80 x99s plan of promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document whose heterodox interpretation and application he would later approve with a series of submagisterial winks and nods both oral and written is the reason i signed onto the correctio filialis nsee the piece by joseph shaw in this regard n nshaw maintains that al can be xe2 x80 x9cbent into some kind of orthodoxy xe2 x80 x9d perhaps nbut it is not our responsibility to bend a pope xe2 x80 x99s statements into conformity with the faith nmoreover any pope who promulgates a document that can be read as orthodox only by a forced interpretation imposed by certain readers xe2 x80 x94while others disagree xe2 x80 x94has by that very fact inflicted grave harm upon on the church which he alone has the duty to correct nbut francis as any reasonable observer can see has no intention of offering any such correction nquite to the contrary confusion as a cover for the introduction of holy communion for xe2 x80 x9ccertain xe2 x80 x9d public adulterers by bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s coconspirators in the vatican and various dioceses is exactly what he was aiming to achieve from the beginning of the whole synodal charade which was merely a vehicle for promulgation of al nas shaw observes of al xe2 x80 x9cwhat we the signers of the correctio are saying is that it has become clear that orthodoxy is not what pope francis wants us to find there xe2 x80 x9d n nin a sense what bergoglio is doing is worse than explicit heresy which could at least be readily identified and denounced as such nbut bergoglio wants the effects of heresy xe2 x80 x94undermining holy matrimony confession and holy communion whose integrity is affirmed verbally xe2 x80 x94without the guilt of an explicit promulgation nin so acting he is very much in the mold of honorius i who was posthumously anathematized by an ecumenical council the third council of constantinople and by his own successor leo ii for aiding and abetting the spread of the monothelite heresy no human but only a divine will in christ nhonorius did so by means of private correspondence with the author of the heresy endorsing the heresy without ever formally proclaiming it as doctrine nand yet honorius i is listed in the canon of the popes and is not considered to have fallen from office on account of heresy na similar judgment might well befall this pope but it is not for us to level it n nmeanwhile as fastiggi and goldstein labor to convince us that nothing is amiss with al pope bergoglio is sending clear signals of concern about the rising opposition among the faithful to his master plan to subvert the church according to his false notion of mercy nin a classic power move he has just given a sop to cardinal burke the perceived leader of the opposition by appointing him to a minor position on the apostolic signatura xe2 x80 x94the same tribunal from which bergoglio brutally removed him as prefect nand this after also humiliating burke as the spiritual patron of the knights of malta to which he was exiled after his removal n nwill this sop buy burke xe2 x80 x99s silence staving off the feared public correction nwe will soon know if the cardinal can be bought so easily nbut this move demonstrates xe2 x80 x94if more evidence were needed xe2 x80 x94that bergoglio has never been the humble apostle of mercy depicted in his carefully crafted public relations narrative but rather a cunning ecclesiastical politician constantly plotting and scheming to get what he wants nthat the neocatholic establishment refuses to recognize the grim reality of this unprecedented pontificate is but another page in the long annals of its shameful defense of the indefensible to the detriment of holy mother church n,"['appeal_to_fear-prejudice',

rigged election of mahmoud ahmadinejad as president nin 2011 obama precipitously removed the remaining us combat troops from iraq giving rise to isis xe2 x80 x99s reemergence in iraq from its bases in syria nthe radical shiite iranian regime purported to come to the xe2 x80 x9crescue xe2 x80 x9d of both countries from the sunni terrorists turning iraq into a virtual vassal state of the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the process nobama disastrous nuclear deal with iran legitimized iran path to eventually becoming a nucleararmed state while immediately filling its coffers with billions of dollars to fund its aggression nmeanwhile syria has become ground zero for iran execution of its regional ambitions which is to establish its shiite crescent connecting with its allies including iraq syria and lebanon nthis plan has included the establishment of a land route that iranianbacked militias secured in june beginning on iran xe2 x80 x99s border with iraq and running across iraq and syria all the way to syria xe2 x80 x99s mediterranean coast nthis road makes iran xe2 x80 x99s job easier in supplying arms by land as well as by air and sea to prop up syrian president bashar alassad xe2 x80 x99s regime and to equip iran xe2 x80 x99s own forces fighting inside of syria in support of assad nthis helps explain why iran has placed so much importance on helping the syrian regime

24,tea with the curate the attack on marriage is an attack on christ in the eucharist n npope paul vi xe2 x80 x99s 1965 encyclical on the eucharist xe2 x80 x9cmysterium fidei xe2 x80 x9d was the first place i saw anyone say that the body and blood soul and complete divinity of christ was actually present in the consecrated species nhaving been raised in remi de roo xe2 x80 x99s victoria in the 1970s i had naturally never heard anything at all about the eucharist nthe understanding that catholics believed what they believe about it came as a bit of a shock nread the full document here  nwith the hindsight of 52 years and a great deal of very dirty and unappealing water under the catholic bridge we can see it as a kind of warning prophecy npublished just three months before the close of vatican ii and just as annibale bugnini was cranking open the floodgates of his neverending stream of liturgical alterations mysterium fidei is now an important marker of a critical turning point in catholic history perhaps the most important of modern times n nwho can read this without cringing at what we now know was about to happen ntherefore we earnestly hope that the restored sacred liturgy will bring forth abundant fruits of eucharistic devotion so that the holy church under this saving sign of piety may make daily progress toward perfect unity and may invite all christians to a unity of faith and of love drawing them gently thanks to the action of divine grace nbut in 1983 at the start of my personal investigations into the catholic religion i knew nothing of any of that nthe encyclical the very first i ever read was also a marker for me of a personal turning point nit was the first time i had ever seen catholic eucharistic doctrine clearly and xe2 x80 x93 most importantly xe2 x80 x93 unapologetically stated nit came right out and said something so astounding something so completely unlikely that i had to admit that it left very few logical possibilities nlike cs nlewis xe2 x80 x99s assessment of the claims by christ of his own divinity this pope was either mad bad or telling the plain truth n nsomething that may be much more noteworthy now in our current circumstances than it was the year i read it is that the pope xe2 x80 x99s very first quote was not of scripture but the council of trent n xe2 x80 x9cat the last supper on the night he was handed over our lord instituted the eucharistic sacrifice of his body and blood to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until he should come and thus entrust to the church his beloved spouse the memorial of his death and resurrection a sacrament of devotion a sign of unity a bond of charity a paschal banquet in which christ is received the soul is filled with grace and there is given to us the pledge of future glory xe2 x80 x9d n nin these words are highlighted both the sacrifice which pertains to the essence of the mass which is celebrated daily and the sacrament in which the faithful participate in holy communion by eating the flesh of christ and drinking his blood receiving both grace the beginning of eternal life and the medicine of immortality ni remember my thoughts upon reading this shocking statement xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9cby doing what n xe2 x80 x9d n nmy acceptance from the reading of this document of the church xe2 x80 x99s orthodox eucharistic doctrine was based in part on pope paul xe2 x80 x99s gracious and beautiful exposition and in part on the sheer radical mad unlikeliness of it nwhat could conceivably be the reason to say anything as wild as this if it weren xe2 x80 x99t true n nthe idea of transubstantiation struck me as i read that document as possibly the strangest and most earth shattering thing i xe2 x80 x99d ever heard nit shocked me out of a kind of swamp of intellectual worldliness presenting the idea to my thirsty mind that there could indeed be fantastic realities far more wonderful than the banal and painfully uninteresting secularist worldview i had been taught to accept nit was as though someone had plausibly told me that yes there were fairies and magical kingdoms in real life xe2 x80 x9cjust around the corner xe2 x80 x9d n nby the time i read it i had been through a long slow transition from a childhood devoted to our lady and confirmed in my belief in wonders to a kind of disappointed practical atheism after three years in a diocesan catholic parochial school ni had been taught by both word and implication that everything the catholic church had taught before vatican ii was pernicious nonsense nwhere it was simply wrong it was ridiculous and where it was wrong and political it was outright wicked n nwhat led me to read that particular encyclical is the most clearly identifiable moment of actual grace in my young life to that point nit was the first time it occurred to me to investigate like an anthropologist what the church herself said about her teachings nwhile mulling grimly one day over all the wickedness of the catholic church i was pulled up short by a single thought xe2 x80 x9ci could be wrong xe2 x80 x9d at 17 it seemed such an unlikely thing to think i was rather shocked nbut stopping a moment to consider i realised that i had only ever heard about catholic things from people who clearly hated the church her enemies in short nit hardly seemed just to convict on the testimony of these obviously biased witnesses nin order to properly and thoroughly condemn the church with convincing due diligence i had to read something about it that didn xe2 x80 x99t come from her enemies n nthe same day i presented myself at the reference desk of the public library and asked xe2 x80 x9cdo you have any books about catholicism nsomething official xe2 x80 x9d the librarian took me to the reference section and showed me the shelves of encyclicals documents and histories nsaints and popes from one end of the stacks to the other nhaving no clear idea what my own question meant i just picked one at random n nthe description of the holy eucharist as the supreme centre from which all our life as catholics flow and from which all other doctrines radiated was something that was not going to come into my head for another eight years of reading nbut even so mysterium fidei forced me to face up to a reality i xe2 x80 x99d never dreamed of before that this the little unassuming wafer was the most important thing in the world n nreading through the encyclical again holding it up next to the current situation in rome makes it easier to clarify certain critical issues ngiven what we are now seeing consider the poignancy of the following passages nwhen dealing with the restoration of the sacred liturgy the fathers of the council by reason of their pastoral concern for the whole church considered it of the highest importance to exhort the faithful to participate actively with sound faith and with the utmost devotion in the celebration of this most holy mystery to offer it with the priest to god as a sacrifice for their own salvation and for that of the whole world and to find in it spiritual nourishment nthis was remember 1965 four years before the new mass was issued and before cardinal ottaviani warned the pope that it was precisely this sacramental reality that was about to be catastrophically obscured n nwho reading this passage does not feel the urge to shout down the years to do something to stave off the disaster that was coming nwe are aware of the fact that among those who deal with this most holy mystery in written or spoken word there are some who with reference either to masses which are celebrated in private or to the dogma of transubstantiation or to devotion to the eucharist spread abroad opinions which disturb the faithful and fill their minds with no little confusion about matters of faith nit is as if everyone were permitted to consign to oblivion doctrine already defined by the church or else to interpret it in such a way as to weaken the genuine meaning of the words or the recognized force of the concepts involved nkeeping cardinal ottaviani xe2 x80 x99s intervention directly before our thoughts we read with a strange kind of helpless dread xe2 x80 xa6 n xe2 x80 xa6it is not allowable to emphasize what is called the xe2 x80 x9ccommunal xe2 x80 x9d mass to the disparagement of masses celebrated in private or to exaggerate the element of sacramental sign as if the symbolism which all certainly admit in the eucharist expresses fully and exhausts completely the mode of christ xe2 x80 x99s presence in this sacrament n nnor is it allowable to discuss the mystery of transubstantiation without mentioning what the council of trent stated about the marvelous conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the body and of the whole substance of the wine into the blood of christ speaking rather only of what is called xe2 x80 x9ctransignification xe2 x80 x9d and xe2 x80 x9ctransfiguration xe2 x80 x9d or finally to propose and act upon the opinion according to which in the consecrated hosts which remain after the celebration of the sacrifice of the mass christ our lord is no longer present n xe2 x80 xa6 n nand therefore so that the hope aroused by the council that a flourishing of eucharistic piety which is now pervading the whole church be not frustrated by this spread of false opinions we have with apostolic authority decided to address you venerable brothers and to express our mind on this subject n1 nthose of us writing similar jeremiads now have been working to clarify that the attack from rome on the moral doctrine of the church isn xe2 x80 x99t about marriage nit xe2 x80 x99s about the eucharist and to a lesser extent the priesthood nthe demonic forces we know are the driving force behind this supreme moment of heresy and destruction aren xe2 x80 x99t really looking at the undermining of marriage as their primary goal they want to get at the eucharist nwe know it is demonically inspired because their hatred is for christ himself in the first place and for anyone who loves and wants to serve him second nthey are men who refuse to bend the knee before the god whom they will not serve n nthis knowledge xe2 x80 x93 that the attack is on the body and blood of christ xe2 x80 x93 can also help readers spot their friends in the crowd nthe places where eucharistic adoration is still offered are places where at least some flicker of the true faith survives nthe bishops and priests now talking about the supreme glory of the eucharist and the need to defend it from sacrilege are lighthouses na case in point is bishop mark davies of my own former diocese of shrewsbury in england nin march 2016 in the midst of the shouting from rome bishop davies spoke at his chrism mass said that only through the xe2 x80 x9creality of the eucharist xe2 x80 x9d could new vocations to the priesthood be found n xe2 x80 x9cin treasuring this gift of priestly celibacy we need to recognize more clearly the intimate link between the ministerial priesthood and the reality of the eucharist nif the mass were ever reduced in our minds to being merely a commemorative meal and the priest as only a community leader or functionary then the celibacy of the catholic priesthood might seem extravagant xe2 x80 x9d nit xe2 x80 x99s almost as if someone had slipped a copy of the ottaviani intervention inside his morning paper n nthe targeting of marriage through the instruments of creatures like the myopic and theologically tunnelvisioned cardinal kasper is demonically brilliant nit xe2 x80 x99s a xe2 x80 x9cstitchup xe2 x80 x9d as the english call it a fix nyou make it a matter of xe2 x80 x9cmercy xe2 x80 x9d backed up by the iron fist that no one in a state of objective mortal sin can be refused holy communion you give the national bishops conferences the power to start enforcing this and you have created a previously unimaginable situation in

x9d n nrobert fastiggi xe2 x80 xa2 13 hours ago n nin the article that i coauthored with dr goldstein we would have done better to speak of the xe2 x80 x9cofficial xe2 x80 x9d latin text rather than the xe2 x80 x9coriginal xe2 x80 x9d latin text nthis though is no longer an issue because the normative text is the latin text published in thr aas nmr ferrara however bases his critique upon an assumption that the xe2 x80 x9cgenerous response xe2 x80 x9d offered to god is a sin nthis though is not what al is saying nthe generous response is a move away from sin and a move toward god ni explain this in my most recent response to prof e christian brugger which can serve as my response to mr ferrara n nposted on lifesitenews nprof brugger is a good theologian and a fine man but he still seems to believe that al 303 implies that god is asking people to continue to sin in some cases nin his april 22 2016 article in catholic world report brugger writes that al 303 suggests that xe2 x80 x9cgod can be xe2 x80 x98asking xe2 x80 x99 someone to live in a lifestate in which they are objectively violating grave matter xe2 x80 x9d then in a sept 28 xe2 x80 x9817 lifesitenews article he states that xe2 x80 x9cthe generous response xe2 x80 x9d owed to god is xe2 x80 x9ca certain state that is objectively at variance with the universal command of the gospel xe2 x80 x9d now prof brugger argues that because the subject remains xe2 x80 x9cthis conscience xe2 x80 x9d in al 303 this proves that the xe2 x80 x9cgenerous offering owed to god xe2 x80 x9d is the recognition that one is living xe2 x80 x9ccontrary to xe2 x80 x9cthe universal command of the gospel xe2 x80 x9d n nprof brugger fails to see that al 303 clearly distinguishes between a conscience xe2 x80 x99s recognition that xe2 x80 x9ca given situation is objectively at variance with the general mandate of the gospel xe2 x80 x9d and this same conscience xe2 x80 x99s subsequent recognition of a xe2 x80 x9cgenerous response owed to god in the present circumstances xe2 x80 x9d the subject xe2 x80 x9cconscience xe2 x80 x9d might be the same but the object is different nthe xe2 x80 x9cgenerous response xe2 x80 x9d is not the situation that is at variance with the command of the gospel but an offering that god is asking amid the mass of impediments even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model n nwhat might be this xe2 x80 x9cgenerous response xe2 x80 x9d pope francis does not give an example in al 303 because he xe2 x80 x99s speaking in general terms of the dynamics of conscience nmoreover he knows that concrete cases vary widely nin our sept 26 article in la stampa dr goldstein and i provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil xe2 x80 x9cmarriage xe2 x80 x9d recognizing that god is calling them to live in continence nwe chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that xe2 x80 x9cthe generous response xe2 x80 x9d could be the ending of a particular sin nour example was an attempt to show that professors brugger and seifert are wrong to believe al 303 implies that god is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state nit xe2 x80 x99s really just the opposite nal 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that god is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin npope francis explains this again in al 305 when he says xe2 x80 x9ca small step in the midst of great human limitations can be more pleasing to god than a life which appears outwardly in order but moves through the day without confronting great difficulties xe2 x80 x99 xe2 x80 x9d n nin a recent interview httpwwwlastampait2017 the italian philosopher rocco buttiglione provides this example for al 303 xe2 x80 x9cimagine a father who has a sick son and the child improves nhe still has fever but has stopped vomiting the child manages to keep in his stomach what he eats and has started a therapy that seems to work nthe father is happy nis he happy about the fact that the child is sick nno he is pleased that his son gives symptoms of improvement and healing xe2 x80 x9d n nthis is what pope francis is saying in al 303 ngod is not happy with situations that are objectively at variance with the command of the gospel ngod however is happy when people in such situations discern in conscience that he is asking them to make a choice that moves in the right direction xe2 x80 x94even if they still need to progress further toward a more complete fulfillment of his will nthis is the law of gradualness not the gradualness of the law nit is sad that this beautiful and compassionate message of al 303 has been so completely misunderstood by scholars who have failed to grasp its true meaning n nchris ferrara to robert fastiggi xe2 x80 xa2 9 hours ago n ni certainly agree that the latin text is the normative text even if it comes later ni certainly do not agree that the latin text eliminates the grave problems with amoris laetitia nrather as i show in my article it only intensifies them n nwith all due respect to dr fastiggi his argument and that of buttiglione that a xe2 x80 x9cmove away from sin xe2 x80 x9d is what is pleasing to god even if the moral norm is not adhered to is sophistical nwhat constitutes a xe2 x80 x9cmove away xe2 x80 x9d from sin if not ceasing to commit the sin nno example is provided in al because none can be nthe notion is nonsensical njust how nonsensical is demonstrated by dr fastiggi xe2 x80 x99s claim that by xe2 x80 x9ca move away from sin xe2 x80 x9d in the case of a divorced and xe2 x80 x9cremarried xe2 x80 x9d couple francis means their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of children nbut that would be ceasing to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandoning the pretense that they are married along with the illicit sexual relation itself nsuch a couple could always be absolved and receive holy communion under the church xe2 x80 x99s constant practice albeit privately to avoid scandal n nat any rate the xe2 x80 x9cbrother and sister xe2 x80 x9d approach to the situation which is that of familiaris consortio 84 is certainly not the one advocated by francis nas my article shows francis has made it quite clear that he approves of admitting to the sacraments divorced and xe2 x80 x9cremarried xe2 x80 x9d people who will continue to live as if they were married including sexual relations while xe2 x80 x9cdiscerning xe2 x80 x9d their situation this xe2 x80 x9cdiscernment xe2 x80 x9d being a mere fig leaf to conceal the proposed toleration of public adultery in the church nthus francis thanked the maltese bishops for their al guidelines which literally mandate admission to the sacraments of divorced and xe2 x80 x9cremarried xe2 x80 x9d people who believe themselves to be xe2 x80 x9cat peace with god xe2 x80 x9d and as he told the bishops of buenos aires in writing xe2 x80 x9cthere is no other interpretation xe2 x80 x9d n nno amount of verbal artifice can conceal what is happening in the church thanks to al public adulterers are being admitted to holy communion without an amendment of life and the bimillenial discipline of the churchwhich john paul insisted involves a moral norm not a mere ecclesiastical law to which everyone is bound in conscience xe2 x80 x9cwithout exception xe2 x80 x9dis being overthrown in place after place n nit is a great disservice to the church to maintain the pretense that there is nothing problematical about al na moral catastrophe is selfevidently underway and it is not possible honestly to deny its cause n nrobert fastiggi to chris ferrara xe2 x80 xa2 2 hours ago n nthank you for your response nyou write well but you do not reveal a proper

entirely sophistical attempt to explain away what francis is clearly doing n nirony of ironies the latterday pharisees and legalists francis sees around every corner are hard at work defending amoris laetitia at the very moment it is being cited by bishop after bishop as their sole authority for admitting public adulterers to holy communionwhile francis does nothing but approve n ni think you

ferrara again for calling attention to an article i coauthored with dr goldstein in la stampa ni give him credit for his colorful style nunfortunately mr ferrara provides no real evidence for his claim that pope francis xe2 x80 x9cwishes the bishops to admit public adulterers in econd marriages to the sacraments while continuing their adulterous relations xe2 x80 x9d n nhe mentions the holy father letter to the buenos aires bishops but he fails to take into account that the statement of those argentine bishops can be interpreted in an orthodox way as cardinal m xc3 xbcller told edward pentin in a sept 28 interview published in the national catholic register nin fact the statement of the argentine bishops only speaks of the possibility of xe2 x80 x9caccess to the sacraments of reconciliation and the eucharist xe2 x80 x9d this could reasonably be interpreted as going to confession before receiving holy communion n nthe same applies to statements of pope francis and cardinal schoenborn mentioned by ferrara npope francis defers to the exposition of amoris laetitia by cardinal schoenborn given in april 2016 when the exhortation was made public ni have read the cardinal exposition in both italian and english and i only find mention of the help of the sacraments in certain cases nonce again mr ferrara assumes this means access to holy communion without prior sacramental confession nwith regard to the letter thanking the bishops of malta it should be noted that edward pentin mentions a letter of cardinal baldiserri not a letter of pope francis nmoreover this letter has not been made public so we dont know exactly what it says other than an expression of thanks nthis seems to be very thin evidence for claiming pope francis wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers to the sacraments while continuing in their adulterous relations nas a lawyer ferrara should have a better sense of what really counts as evidence nas a christian he should also be mindful of the command against bearing false witness n nbeyond these considerations i wish to express a personal concern i have about mr ferrara standing in the catholic church nhe says that dr goldstein and i are xe2 x80 x9cfoot soldiers of a leviathan church xe2 x80 x9d because we defend the roman pontiff ndoes mr ferrara believe that the catholic church under pope francis is a xe2 x80 x9cleviathan church xe2 x80 x9d and not the catholic church nif this is so then it would suggest that mr ferrara is refusing submission to the roman pontiff and communion with the members of the church subject to him nthis though is the very definition of schism found in the catechism of the catholic church 2089 and the 1983 cic canon 751 ni hope mr ferrara can clarify what he means by the xe2 x80 x9cleviathan church xe2 x80 x9d under pope francis na more simple question to him would be this xe2 x80 x9care you refusing submission to the roman pontiff or communion with the members subject to him xe2 x80 x9d n ni apologize ahead of time if i misconstrued his words ni believe though my question is reasonable in light of his reference to a xe2 x80 x9cleviathan church xe2 x80 x9d distinct from xe2 x80 x9cthe dictates of the immortal god in heaven xe2 x80 x9d n nchris ferrara to robert fastiggi xe2 x80 xa2 9 hours ago n nif dr fastiggi wishes to continue to pretend despite a growing mountain of evidence that pope francis has not in fact approved of the admission of public adulterers to holy communionjust as he did when archbishop of buenos aires and just as he did with the woman he telephoned in argentina xe2 x80 x94then i cannot help him n nas for my metaphorical reference to a xe2 x80 x9cleviathan church xe2 x80 x9d i am afraid dr fastiggi has succumbed to an unfortunate literalmindedness nto make it clear for him i am contending that he and his coauthor treat the pope as if he were the absolute ruler of hobbes xe2 x80 x99s leviathan ni do not as should be obvious argue that this leviathan church actually exists nthat it does not and cannot exist is precisely my point n ndr fastiggi xe2 x80 x99s inapt citation to canon 751 and his clumsy and insulting questions about my xe2 x80 x9cstanding in the catholic church xe2 x80 x9d and whether i am xe2 x80 x9crefusing submission to the roman pontiff xe2 x80 x9d demonstrate a pronounced lack of comprehension of pertinent ecclesiological and theological basics and a rather embarrassing lack of rhetorical finesse nraising objections to a papal document because it appears to depart from sound orthodoxy is hardly xe2 x80 x9crefusing submission to the roman pontiff xe2 x80 x9d who has not at any rate actually commanded anyone to xe2 x80 x9csubmit xe2 x80 x9d to anything via al n ni

shooting particularly a mass shooting it may take some time for a precise timeline to develop nbut it didn xe2 x80 x99t take very long for the las vegas police to release a precise timeline nthe initial timeline was that stephen paddock xe2 x80 x99s shooting stopped when approximately 6 minutes after he started he was interrupted by a security guard from the mandalay bay hotel npaddock then turned his fire into the hallway firing some 200 bullets and after that the shooting stopped as police arrived nthat was version no n1 nsome days later the las vegas police backed away from that timeline and stated that the security guard actually arrived 6 minutes before paddock started shooting into the crowd 32 stories below him nthat raised a number of question including why no one called 911 after what must have been a loud volley of shots in a hotel hallway nthat was version no n2 nbut now that is disputed in version no n3 nwapo reports nlas vegas police said friday that the gunman who opened fire on a country music festival far below his hotel suite did not shoot a security guard six minutes before that rampage contradicting a timeline they had offered earlier this week xe2 x80 xa6 nthe confusion began monday when police said that the gunman fired at the hotel security guard jesus campos six minutes before the mass shooting began not during the massacre as they had said nlombardo also said police had hunted for the source of the gunfire and that officers responding to the gunman xe2 x80 x99s floor were unaware that a guard was shot until they arrived there at which point the shooting rampage had ended nmgm resorts pushed back on this account first saying tuesday that there were unspecified inaccuracies and then on thursday releasing a statement directly contradicting parts of what the police had said xe2 x80 xa6 nlombardo had said monday that campos the guard was shot at 959 pm and that the mass shooting began at 1005 pm nthis sixminute gap relayed by lombardo left uncertain whether there was any lag in alerting police to the source of the gunfire during critical moments npolice said officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 1017 pm two minutes after paddock had stopped firing nmgm though said it was xe2 x80 x9cconfident xe2 x80 x9d that the 959 pm time was inaccurate and xe2 x80 x9cwas derived from a mandalay bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have xe2 x80 x9d the company also disputed the suggestion of a lag saying the shooting rampage began within a minute of campos reporting his injury on the 32nd floor non friday lombardo effectively agreed with the company xe2 x80 x99s statement though he argued that the 959 pm time he had offered four days earlier xe2 x80 x9cwasn xe2 x80 x99t inaccurate when i provided it xe2 x80 x9d lombardo said he was told this time had been written by someone in a security log nupon investigation lombardo said police learned that campos first encountered a barricaded door on the 32nd floor at 959 pm nthe guard was eventually fired upon by paddock xe2 x80 x9cin close proximity to xe2 x80 x9d 1005 pm when the mass shooting began lombardo continued nclear right nnot so fast the police and hotel still have disagreement over important details such as when police arrived relative to paddock xe2 x80 x99s shooting at the crowd an enormous

34,kerry on edge as legacy crumbles n nformer secretary of state john kerry wasted no time condemning president trump xe2 x80 x99s decision not to recertify and to possibly withdraw from the disastrous nuclear deal with iran that kerry negotiated on behalf of his boss barack obama npresident trump insisted on significant improvements to the joint plan of comprehensive action jcpoa as the deal is formally known nthe jcpoa xe2 x80 x99s fundamental flaws that president trump wants fixed include iran xe2 x80 x99s ability to block unfettered international inspections the wiggle room that iran is exploiting to continue developing and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and the sunset clause on nuclear enrichment that would provide iran a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state after the current restrictions are lifted nobama and kerry had promised that these issues would be dealt with satisfactorily before agreeing to the final terms of the jcpoa ninstead they caved to iranian pressure in order to get the deal done nnow that president trump is trying to clean up the mess obama and kerry left him kerry has the gall to label president trump xe2 x80 x99s decision a reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology and to accuse the trump administration of xe2 x80 x9clying to the american people xe2 x80 x9d it was the obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts in pressing ahead with the deal nthe obama administration lied to the american people abandoning its own promises to ensure that the deal contained ironclad protections nmoreover all that president trump has done so far is to return the jcpoa to congress for review nhad obama followed the constitution and submitted the jcpoa to the senate as a treaty in the first place the jcpoa in its present form almost certainly would not have been approved ncongress should now have the opportunity to revisit the jcpoa to determine whether the protections that the obama administration promised are working as advertised ncongress should also consider whether time limits on iran xe2 x80 x99s commitments continue to make sense in light of what we are now experiencing with iran xe2 x80 x99s nuclear technology collaborator north korea nit bought time to turn into a fullfledged nuclear power under our noses nkerry had promised that the iranian regime would be prohibited from testing ballistic missiles nthis turned out to be a lie nafter the jcpoa was finalized with no such prohibition included iran continued to test such missiles nthe obama administration xe2 x80 x99s response was that the missiles had become a separate issue to be dealt with under a new united nations security council resolution endorsing the jcpoa nthe new resolution replaced clear prohibitions imposed on iran xe2 x80 x99s ballistic missile program with a weak declaration in an annex that simply xe2 x80 x9ccalls upon xe2 x80 x9d iran not to undertake any activity such as development and test launches related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years niran has tested several ballistic missiles during the last two years including two qadr h missiles with the phrase xe2 x80 x9cisrael must be wiped out xe2 x80 x9d emblazoned on the sides nthe commander of iran xe2 x80 x99s army major general ataollah salehi had told reporters just a month before the launch of those missiles that iran was neither paying any attention to the resolutions against iran nor implementing them nthis is not a breach of the jcpoa xe2 x80 x9d nrussian ambassador to the united nations vitaly churkin spurning requests from obama administration officials to impose sanctions against iran under the security council resolution asserted that the iranian missile test did not violate the resolution n xe2 x80 x9ca call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call you can comply with a call or you can ignore the call but you cannot violate a call xe2 x80 x9d the russian ambassador said nin short the jcpoa did not cover the missile tests and the replacement un security council resolution that did mention the missiles is toothless ndeputy national security advisor ben rhodes told cnn during an interview aired on april 6 2015 that under the deal xe2 x80 x99s terms then still being negotiated xe2 x80 x9cyou will have anywhere anytime 247 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that iran has nrhodes claimed that xe2 x80 x9cif we see a site that we need to inspect on a military facility we can get access to that site and inspect it nso if it  a suspicious site that we believe is related to its nuclear efforts we can get access and inspect that site through the iaea xe2 x80 x9d this was another lie nafter the jcpoa was finalized in july 2015 rhodes shamelessly denied that anytime anywhere inspections were ever considered as part of the negotiations n xe2 x80 x9cwe never sought in this negotiation the capacity for socalled anytime anywhere xe2 x80 x9d rhodes said on july 14 2015 nthe jcpoa xe2 x80 x99s supporters including kerry have made much of the fact that the international atomic energy agency iaea has on several occasions verified iran xe2 x80 x99s compliance with its commitments under the jcpoa keeping its stock of lowenriched uranium below the limit set forth in the jcpoa and not pursuing further construction of the arak reactor niran was found to have slightly exceeded the limit on its stock of heavy water but has remedied the problem to the iaea xe2 x80 x99s satisfaction niaea chief yukiya amano reiterated in a statement he issued on october 9th that iran has remained in compliance with its jcpoa commitments nthe problem as any cleareyed observer of the process recognizes is that the iaea relies on iran for selfinspection of certain sites that the regime does not want the iaea to inspect freely on its own niaea inspectors have avoided examining military sites it knows exists and has no reliable way of tracking undeclared sites nthe iaea xe2 x80 x99s explanation for not visiting any of iran xe2 x80 x99s known military sites is that it had xe2 x80 x9cno reason to ask xe2 x80 x9d for access nevidently the iaea is supposed to block out the fact that iran had conducted tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations at a military site before the jcpoa xe2 x80 x99s finalization in 2015 nthe iaea should just pretend that such tests could not possibly happen again n xe2 x80 x9cnobody is allowed to visit iran  military sites xe2 x80 x9d said iran xe2 x80 x99s head of strategic research center at the expediency council and adviser to supreme leader ayatollah khamenei ali akbar velayati nintimidation works nthe iaea knows not to ask nas to the jcpoa xe2 x80 x99s sunset provisions the obama administration lied about that too nkerry claimed on september 2 2015 that the jcpoa xe2 x80 x9cnever sunsets nthere xe2 x80 x99s no sunset in this agreement xe2 x80 x9d nthis month kerry has resorted to parsing words nhe claims the phrase  unset provisions  is a xe2 x80 x9cmisnomer xe2 x80 x9d before then defending the jcpoa xe2 x80 x99s time limits nwe were comfortable because the cap on iran xe2 x80 x99s lowenriched uranium stockpile remains in place until 2030 xe2 x80 x9d kerry wrote in an article published in the washington post late last month nin other words let xe2 x80 x99s just kick the can down the road and hope for a more reasonable iranian regime in 13 years that would agree to extend the time limits nin the meantime kerry advises us not to worry nkerry declared xe2 x80 x9c15 or 25 years from now we still have the same military options we have today xe2 x80 x9d njohn kerry has obviously learned nothing from the north korean fiasco which resulted from years of phony agreements with the rogue regime and socalled xe2 x80 x9cstrategic patience xe2 x80 x9d the united states clearly does not have the same military options today to deal with a nuclear armed north korea as it did 23 years ago when former president bill clinton decided not to use military force to stamp out north korea xe2 x80 x99s nuclear program at its inception ninstead clinton started us down the primrose path of na xc3 xafve diplomacy with a duplicitous regime that now is on the verge of being able to strike the us mainland with nuclear warheads delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles nit is precisely because north korea xe2 x80 x99s actions over the last 23 years have proven that making concessions to a rogue regime in order to obtain denuclearization commitments is so dangerous that president trump does not want to make the same mistake with iran namerica xe2 x80 x99s european allies are also upset with president trump for refusing to recertify the deal and threatening to pull out if certain conditions are not met nbritish prime minister theresa may french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor angela merkel issued a joint statement last friday praising the jcpoa and its implementation nthey said that the nuclear deal with iran was xe2 x80 x9cthe culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that iran xe2 x80 x99s nuclear programme is not diverted for military purposes ntherefore we encourage the us administration and congress to consider the implications to the security of the us and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the jcpoa such as reimposing sanctions on iran lifted under the agreement xe2 x80 x9d nperhaps these european leaders should remember their own history nappeasement through phony deals with a rogue dictatorship does not work as proven by the infamous munich pact signed by british and french prime ministers neville chamberlain and edouard daladier with german chancellor adolf hitler seventynine years ago n,"['appeal_to_fear-prejudice', 'repetition', 'loaded_language', 'slogans', 'flag-waving', 'bandwagon',

acquiring nuclear weapons or stemming its hegemonic rise in the middle east or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism ntrump xe2 x80 x99s move was not operational nit was directional n nin his address friday trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate us policy on iran nfor the first time since 2009 when obama backed the murderous regime in tehran spurning the millions of iranians who rose up in the green revolution trump opened up the possibility that the us may begin to base its policies toward iran on reality n ntrump began his remarks by setting out iran xe2 x80 x99s long rap sheet of aggression against america n nstarting with the us embassy seizure and hostage crisis trump described iran xe2 x80 x99s crimes and acts of war against america in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did n ntrump xe2 x80 x99s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime xe2 x80 x99s repression of its own people n nby merging iran xe2 x80 x99s external aggression with its internal repression trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge xe2 x80 x93 or expand the wedge xe2 x80 x93 between the authoritarian theocrats that rule iran and the largely secular multiethnic and prowestern people of iran n ntrump then turned his attention to iran xe2 x80 x99s illicit ballistic missile program its sponsorship of terrorism including its links to alqaida its aggression against its neighbors its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the straits of hormuz and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the middle east through its proxies n nit is notable that these remarks preceded trump xe2 x80 x99s discussion of the nuclear deal xe2 x80 x93 which was the ostensible subject of his speech nbefore trump discussed iran xe2 x80 x99s breaches of the nuclear deal he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat iran constitutes to us national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord n nthis was a critical point because for the past two years us discourse on iran has focused solely on whether or not iran was complying with obama xe2 x80 x99s nuclear pact nby placing the nuclear deal in the context of iran xe2 x80 x99s consistent overarching hostility and aggression trump made it selfevident that no us interest is served in continuing to give iran a free pass from congressional sanctions n nafter accomplishing that goal trump turned his attention to how iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact nonly then almost as an afterthought did he announce that he was decertifying iranian compliance with the nuclear deal setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the us its interests and allies n nby empowering congress to prohibit economic cooperation with iran trump put the europeans chinese and russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the us and conducting business with iran n nafter putting them on notice trump discussed the possibility of improving obama xe2 x80 x99s nuclear accord namong other things he suggested expanding the inspection regime against iran xe2 x80 x99s nuclear installations and canceling the socalled xe2 x80 x9csunset xe2 x80 x9d clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of iran xe2 x80 x99s nuclear advancement n ntrump xe2 x80 x99s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major positive shift in us policy toward iran nsuch a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of trump xe2 x80 x99s goals of preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies n nunfortunately it is also likely indeed it is more likely that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims n ntrump xe2 x80 x99s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to congress for holding iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move nhe has a lot of enemies and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on capitol hill n nobama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if senator bob corker chairman of the senate foreign affairs committee hadn xe2 x80 x99t agreed to cast the constitution aside and ignore obama xe2 x80 x99s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the senate for ratification as a treaty n nover the past week trump and corker have been involved in an ugly public fight precipitated by corker xe2 x80 x99s announcement that he will not be seeking reelection next year n ntoday corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling trump xe2 x80 x99s agenda nif he wishes out of spite corker can block effective sanctions from being passed nand he may do so even though the implications for his senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of iran xe2 x80 x99s nuclear program n nwhat is true for corker is doubly true for the democrats n nleading democratic senators like robert menendez ben cardin and chuck schumer who opposed obama xe2 x80 x99s iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the trump administration they are required to oppose any change to the iran nuclear agreement review act n nindeed given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give iran a free pass for its antiamerican aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with republicans on capitol hill and in the white house n nthen again by framing the issue of iran xe2 x80 x99s threat to america as he did and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on iran to congress trump opened up the possibility that congress will conduct substantive xe2 x80 x93 rather than personal xe2 x80 x93 debates on iran n nand the more substantive those debates become the further away the us discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of obama xe2 x80 x99s iran policy xe2 x80 x93 that the iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential us ally and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about iran xe2 x80 x99s illicit nuclear weapons program n nthe second major risk inherent in trump xe2 x80 x99s approach is that he will get his way that the europeans russians and chinese and the iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal nthe problem here is not obvious nclearly it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime n nyet even an amended improved deal will still serve as a shield to iran xe2 x80 x99s nuclear program nan improved deal won xe2 x80 x99t destroy iran xe2 x80 x99s centrifuges n nit won xe2 x80 x99t take away iran xe2 x80 x99s enriched uranium nit won xe2 x80 x99t destroy iran xe2 x80 x99s nuclear installations nand it won xe2 x80 x99t bring down the regime which by its nature ensures all of these things will remain a menace to the us its allies and international security as a whole n nso long as the us continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions it will continue to ensure that iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat ndistressingly us ambassador to the un nikki haley the most outspoken supporter of decertifying iranian compliance in the trump administration told nbc on sunday that the us intends to remain in the nuclear deal n nto understand what must be done we must return to trump xe2 x80 x99s speech and its strategic significance n nby taking a holistic view of the iranian threat xe2 x80 x93 grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime xe2 x80 x93 trump opened up the possibility that the us and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating iran and its proxies nif the iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy they can be helpful n na wider strategy would target iran xe2 x80 x99s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from hezbollah and hamas to the regimes in iraq yemen syria and lebanon nit would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs xe2 x80 x99 domestic opponents nit would pin down iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the iraqi kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the iranian border while strengthening the ties between iranian kurds and iraqi kurds n nfriday trump created the possibility for such a strategy nit is up to members of congress and us allies like israel and the sunni arab states to help trump conceive and implement it nif they fail the possibility trump created will be lost perhaps irrevocably n,"['appeal_to_fear-prejudice',

38,fbi informant xe2 x80 x9cthreatened xe2 x80 x9d after offering details linking clinton foundation to russian bribery case n nthis report was originally published by tyler durden at zero hedge nwhile the mainstream media has largely ignored it the scandal surrounding russian efforts to acquire 20 of america xe2 x80 x99s uranium reserves a deal which was ultimately approved by the obama administration and more specifically the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius which included hillary clinton and eric holder is becoming more problematic for democrats by the hour nas the hill pointed out earlier this morning the latest development in this sordid tale revolves around a man that the fbi used as an informant back in 2009 and beyond to build a case against a russian perpetrator who ultimately admitted to bribery extortion and money laundering nthe informant who is so far only known as xe2 x80 x9cconfidential source 1 xe2 x80 x9d says that when he attempted to come forward last year with information that linked the clinton foundation directly to the scandal he was promptly silenced by the fbi and the obama administration nworking as a confidential witness the businessman made kickback payments to the russians with the approval of his fbi handlers and gathered other evidence the records show nsources told the hill the informant xe2 x80 x99s work was crucial to the government xe2 x80 x99s ability to crack a multimillion dollar racketeering scheme by russian nuclear officials on us soil that involved bribery kickbacks money laundering and extortion nin the end the main russian executive sent to the us to expand russian president vladimir putin xe2 x80 x99s nuclear business an executive of an american trucking firm and a russian financier from new jersey pled guilty to various crimes in a case that started in 2009 and ended in late 2015 ntoensing added her client has had contact from multiple congressional committees seeking information about what he witnessed inside the russian nuclear industry and has been unable to provide that information because of the nda n xe2 x80 x9che can xe2 x80 x99t disclose anything that he came upon in the course of his work xe2 x80 x9d she said nthe information the client possesses includes specific allegations that russian executives made to him about how they facilitated the obama administration xe2 x80 x99s 2010 approval of the uranium one deal and sent millions of dollars in russian nuclear funds to the us to an entity assisting bill clinton xe2 x80 x99s foundation nat the time hillary clinton was serving as secretary of state on the government panel that approved the deal the lawyer said nit has been previously reported that bill clinton accepted 500000 in russian speaking fees in 2010 and collected millions more in donations for his foundation from parties with a stake in the uranium one deal transactions that both the clintons and the obama administration denied had any influence on the approval nin the midst of the new discoveries revealed yesterday about the uranium one case see fbi uncovered russian bribery plot before obama approved uranium one deal netting clintons millions xe2 x80 x9cconfidential source 1 xe2 x80 x9d has once again hired an attorney victoria toensing a former reagan justice department official and former chief counsel of the senate intelligence committee to get his story out nsitting down with the hill earlier toensing said that the last time her client tried to speak out xe2 x80 x9cboth his reputation and liberty xe2 x80 x9d were xe2 x80 x9cthreatened xe2 x80 x9d by the obama administration in a effort to force his silence n xe2 x80 x9call of the information about this corruption has not come out xe2 x80 x9d she said in an interview tuesday n xe2 x80 x9cand so my client the same part of my client that made him go into the fbi in the first place says xe2 x80 x98this is wrong nwhat should i do about it xe2 x80 x99 xe2 x80 x9d ntoensing said she also possesses memos that recount how the justice department last year threatened her client when he attempted to file a lawsuit that could have drawn attention to the russian corruption during the 2016 presidential race as well as helped him recover some of the money russians stole from him through kickbacks during the fbi probe nthe undercover client witnessed xe2 x80 x9ca lot of bribery going on around the us xe2 x80 x9d but was asked by the fbi to sign a nondisclosure agreement nda that prevents him from revealing what he knows to congress toensing explained nwhen he tried to bring some of the allegations to light in the lawsuit last year xe2 x80 x9cthe obama justice department threatened him with loss of freedom nthey said they would bring a criminal case against him for violating an nda xe2 x80 x9d she added nemails obtained by the hill show that a civil attorney working with the former undercover witness described the pressure the justice department exerted to keep the client from disclosing to a federal court what he knew last summer n xe2 x80 x9cthe government was taking a very harsh position that threatened both your reputation and liberty xe2 x80 x9d the civil lawyer wrote in one email nin another she added xe2 x80 x9cas you will recall the gov xe2 x80 x99t made serious threats sufficient to cause you to withdraw your civil complaint xe2 x80 x9d nas we pointed out last summer when peter schweizer first released his feature documentary clinton cash the uranium one deal at the center of this scandal is believed to have netted the clintons and their clinton foundation millions of dollars in donations and xe2 x80 x98speaking fees xe2 x80 x99 from uranium one shareholders and other russian entities nrussian purchase of us uranium assets in return for 145mm in contributions to the clinton foundation xe2 x80 x93 bill and hillary clinton assisted a canadian financier frank giustra and his company uranium one in the acquisition of uranium mining concessions in kazakhstan and the united states nsubsequently the russian government sought to purchase uranium one but required approval from the obama administration given the strategic importance of the uranium assets nin the runup to the approval of the deal by the state department nine shareholders of uranium one just happened to make 145mm in donations to the clinton foundation nmoreover the new yorker confirmed that bill clinton received 500000 in speaking fees from a russian investment bank with ties to the kremlin around the same time nneedless to say the state department approved the deal giving russia ownership of 20 of us uranium assets nmeanwhile the xe2 x80 x98journalists xe2 x80 x99 over at cnn are still trying to get to the

39,iranian aggression intensifies n nlast july major general mohammad bagheri the iranian revolutionary guards irgc military commander and chief of staff of iran xe2 x80 x99s armed forces warned that xe2 x80 x9cputting the revolutionary guard in the terrorist lists with terrorist groups can be very costly to the united states and its military bases and forces in the region xe2 x80 x9d irgc commander mohammad ali jafari said on october 8th that if the news is correct about the stupidity of the american government in considering the revolutionary guards a terrorist group then the revolutionary guards will consider the american army to be like islamic state all around the world nthe next day the iranian regime warned of a crushing response if the united states were to designate the irgc as a terrorist organization npresident trump has called the iranian regime xe2 x80 x99s bluff with his announcement last week that he would do just that ndesignating the irgc as a terrorist organization and imposing new sanctions for its aggressive actions in the region is not a restoration of the sanctions lifted by the obama administration as part of its disastrous nuclear deal with iran nif iran insists it can do what it wants militarily in terms of missile launches support of terrorist groups such as hezbollah and hamas and arms transfers without violating the nuclear deal then the united states can certainly act to curb such activities through financial pressure nthe us can impose sanctions against the iranian regime xe2 x80 x99s principal instrument for projecting aggressive destabilizing force outside of its borders without violating the nuclear deal nthe iranian regime does not see it that way however nwith the lifting of the nuclearrelated sanctions making available billions of dollars to iran xe2 x80 x99s leaders to further finance the irgc xe2 x80 x99s exploits in iraq syria lebanon yemen and elsewhere the regime is furious that the trump administration is tightening the financial screws again even if for reasons not directly related to iran xe2 x80 x99s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal nthus it is threatening us forces and bases in the region na couple of seemingly unrelated events this past week point to iran xe2 x80 x99s positioning itself for more aggressive military actions that could place us forces in harm xe2 x80 x99s way non tuesday major general bagheri landed in damascus for talks with syrian president bashar assad and senior syrian officials including the defense minister and the chief of staff of the syrian armed forces nbagheri is quoted as saying that his visit xe2 x80 x99s purpose was to xe2 x80 x9cput a joint strategy on continuing coordination and cooperation at the military level xe2 x80 x9d some experts on iran believe that bagheri xe2 x80 x99s visit to damascus at this time is intended to reinforce a message that iran will continue to supply weaponry to syria and to reinforce the presence of its terrorist proxy hezbollah in syria nthis will not only serve to bolster the assad regime but it also will strengthen iran  ability to follow through on its threats to the us and its allies principally israel nmeanwhile following the departure of the kurds from kirkuk iraq earlier this week the irgc xe2 x80 x99s operational al qods arm reportedly established a command center and five bases there naccording to debkafile this constitutes xe2 x80 x9cthe first military facility iran has ever established openly in iraq xe2 x80 x9d the kirkuk region holds 45 percent of iraqi xe2 x80 x99s oil nthe iraqi branch of iran xe2 x80 x99s terrorist proxy hezbollah has vowed that once isis is defeated it will start killing americans as it has done before nit is against this backdrop that us ambassador to the united nations nikki haley used her entire speech to the un security council on wednesday to denounce the iranian regime on multiple grounds nthe session was supposed to be devoted to the israelipalestinian conflict but ambassador haley departed from the monthly ritual during which israel is normally singled out for criticism by other council members nshe went after iran instead nshe explained why the trump administration decided to take xe2 x80 x9ca comprehensive approach to confronting the iranian regime xe2 x80 x9d which does not give the regime a get out of jail free card even if it is in technical compliance with the loopholeridden nuclear deal agreed to by the obama administration n xe2 x80 x9cwe can xe2 x80 x99t talk about stability in the middle east without talking about iran xe2 x80 x9d ambassador haley said n xe2 x80 x9cthat xe2 x80 x99s because nearly every threat to peace and security in the middle east is connected to iran xe2 x80 x99s

international community do the same njudging iran by the narrow confines of the nuclear deal misses the true nature of the threat niran must be judged in totality of its aggressive destabilizing and unlawful behavior nto do otherwise would be foolish xe2 x80 x9d nambassador haley accused the iranian regime of continuing to xe2 x80 x9cplay xe2 x80 x9d the security council n xe2 x80 x9ciran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior nand we have allowed them to get away with it nthis must stop xe2 x80 x9d nambassador haley proceeded to list various violations by the iranian regime of security council resolutions pertaining to the transfer of conventional weapons from iran and the arming of terrorist groups including the houthi rebels in yemen and hezbollah nshe also pointed to what she called the iranian regime xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9cmost threatening act xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x93 its launch of ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons n xe2 x80 x9cwhen a rogue regime starts down the path of ballistic missiles it tells us that we will soon have another north korea on our hands xe2 x80 x9d ambassador haley said n xe2 x80 x9cif it is wrong for north korea to do this why doesn xe2 x80 x99t that same mentality apply to iran n xe2 x80 x9c nas for the iran xe2 x80 x99s supposed technical compliance with its commitments under the nuclear deal itself known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa the un xe2 x80 x99s international inspectors are not able to visit iran xe2 x80 x99s military sites npast work on nuclear explosive trigger devices appears to have taken place at one or more such sites in the past ninternational atomic energy agency iaea director general yukiya amano admitted last month that when it comes to the iaea xe2 x80 x99s capacity to check whether iran was conducting work on a nuclear explosive device his agency xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9ctools are limited xe2 x80 x9d the iranian regime has also attempted to skirt the restrictions in the jcpoa on its procurement of materials equipment goods and technology related to iran xe2 x80 x99s nuclear activities nthe heritage foundation noted in its recent report on the jcpoa for example that iran was xe2 x80 x9ccaught redhanded trying to purchase nuclear technology and restricted ballistic missile technology from german companies xe2 x80 x9d nus intelligence had discovered north korea xe2 x80 x99s transfer of missile parts to iran at the very same time that iran was negotiating the nuclear deal in clear violation of un security council resolutions then in effect nthe obama administration chose to look the other way ndoes anybody with a modicum of sense really believe that such collaboration between the two rogue nations is not going on today niran is flush with cash thanks to the jcpoa nit wants to build out its missile and nuclear enrichment capabilities nin addition to covert transfers of materials and technology to iran in violation of the nuclear deal the jcpoa may provide a loophole for iran to exploit in outsourcing some of the development work to north korea for hard currency which north korea desperately needs nthey are a perfect match for each other nproponents of the jcpoa argue that exiting the nuclear deal unless it is changed to the trump administration xe2 x80 x99s satisfaction would undermine us credibility with north korea and thereby kill any chance of negotiations to resolve the crisis caused by north korea  continued testing of sophisticated nuclear arms and ballistic missiles nif we want to talk to north korea now the possible end for the nuclear deal with iran would jeopardize the credibility of such treaties reuters quoted german foreign minister sigmar gabriel as saying ngermany is one of the parties to the jcpoa nother european allies have voiced similar concerns nso have obama xe2 x80 x99s former secretaries of state hillary clinton and john kerry nthis argument is absurd on its face nthe whole point is to prevent iran from becoming the next north korea not to kick the can down the road as usual nnorth korea xe2 x80 x99s aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons and of intercontinental ballistic missiles equipped with nuclear warheads proves that weak agreements full of frontloaded goodies rewarding rogue regimes for elusive

long blocked and classified jfk files to be opened xe2 x80 x9d italics added nthe operative words of course are xe2 x80 x9csubject to the receipt of further information xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d nwhat is going on here nnegotiations nthe art of the deal nthe cia desperately does not want to show the american people its longsecret jfkrelated records nit has asked trump to continue keeping at least some of them secret notwithstanding the passage of more than 50 years since the kennedy assassination nunder longestablished custom and tradition in washington dc when someone asks someone else for a favor the person who is in a position to grant the favor demands something in return nthat xe2 x80 x99s where the negotiations between trump and the cia come into play ntrump wants something in return nwe don xe2 x80 x99t know what xe2 x80 x94 maybe laying off on the russia investigation xe2 x80 x94 but his announcement last friday is obviously part of the concluding steps of such negotiations ntime to buy old us gold coins nwhat trump has done with his announcement is send a clear message to the cia xe2 x80 x9cgive me what i want and i xe2 x80 x99ll give you want you want notherwise i will let all your cherished longsecret records relating to the jfk assassination be shown to the american people xe2 x80 x9d nmake no mistake about it a deal is about to be made nthe cia will cave nit will end up giving trump whatever it is he wants ntrump is in the driver xe2 x80 x99s seat because the cia cannot afford to permit the american people to see the records it wants to continue to be kept secret nand once the cia gives trump what he wants he will cave and give the cia the continued secrecy it so desperately needs nall this will happen by this thursday the date set by law for release of all the jfk records that trump has not blocked nthink about it the cia has asked the president to continue secrecy of records that are more than 50 years old or apparently some relating to secret correspondence between the cia and the assassination records review board back in the 1990s nthe cia xe2 x80 x99s ground n xe2 x80 x9cnational security xe2 x80 x9d of course the two most important and meaningless words in the american political lexicon nnational security nreally nwhatever definition that one might put on that nebulous term no reasonable person can honestly believe that the release of 50yearold records are going to result in the united states falling into the ocean or even that the communists are going to take over the federal government nthe cia says that releasing its decadesold jfk records will reveal secret xe2 x80 x9cmethods xe2 x80 x9d of intelligence gathering nreally nwhat like the cia was using typewriters instead of computers and pay telephones instead of cell phones nwhat is amazing or not is the extreme nonchalance of the mainstream media to the cia xe2 x80 x99s request for continued secrecy nthat should be big news nit xe2 x80 x99s essentially an admission of guilt given that it is absolutely ludicrous to think that xe2 x80 x9cnational security xe2 x80 x9d would be threatened by the release of the cia xe2 x80 x99s longsecret jfkassassinationrelated records nyou see the mainstream media starts with the assumption that the cia had nothing to do with the assassination nin their minds the assassination was committed by a lone nut former us marine communist one who had no motive to kill the president nsuch being the case the mainstream media deferring to the cia automatically concludes that its wish to continue keeping secret has to be based on xe2 x80 x9cnational security xe2 x80 x9d grounds rather than an attempt by the cia to continue its coverup of its assassination of the president nlet xe2 x80 x99s proceed from the opposite assumption that the cia in partnership with the military and the mafia orchestrated the assassination by framing a former us marine who was then working for us intelligence either navy intelligence the cia or the fbi or a combination of all three ndon xe2 x80 x99t forget after all that that xe2 x80 x99s what oswald said nhe said he was being framed nyet from the very beginning the mainstream media has never given any serious consideration to the possibility that oswald was framed for the crime ninstead they have steadfastly stuck with the official story one that has all the characteristics of a pat frameup that oswald acted alone or possibly acted in concert with others both of which lead to nothing but dead ends contradictions and anomalies nnow let xe2 x80 x99s assume instead that oswald was telling the truth when he said he was being framed nin that case it would be imperative that the cia and the military keep as tight a lid on their records as possible to ensure that investigators or investigative reporters would have a difficult time piercing through to the circumstantial evidence that establishes the frameup nas part of the frameup the cia would have to fortify the persona of oswald its intelligence agent as a purported communist nthat would enable the cia to blame the assassination on a communist which not coincidentally was the advice that the pentagon and the cia were doling out to latin american military dictatorships at the school of the americas nin cases of covert statesponsored assassinations latin american regimes were taught a good strategy was to blame the assassination on a communist because then they could smear anyone who challenged the official story as a communist sympathizer nit would also explain why the cia was closely monitoring oswald xe2 x80 x99s movements prior to the assassination something else that the cia kept secret for decades nthey had to make certain that oswald was not on to them and had not discovered that he was being set up for a frameup nthe first organization that came out with a press release advertising oswald xe2 x80 x99s bona fides was the dre an anticommunist group in new orleans with which oswald had had contact nwhat no one knew at the time and what the cia intentionally kept secret for decades was that the dre was a cia front organization nit was being generously funded by the cia and controlled by a secret cia agent named george joannides which the cia would intentionally keep secret from the warren commission in the 1960s the house select committee in the 1970s and the assassination records review board in the 1990s nbut there was another big operation to establish oswald xe2 x80 x99s communist bona fides before the assassination nit had to do with oswald xe2 x80 x99s trip to mexico city where he visited the cuban and soviet embassies nsomething dreadful obviously went wrong with that part of the operation because the official investigation into it was quickly shut down during the early postassassination period ntoday oswald xe2 x80 x99s mexico city trip which is part of those cia records ready to be released is still shrouded in mystery nthe cia xe2 x80 x99s continued secrecy in the jfk assassination is no big surprise nas i wrote in my october 11 article xe2 x80 x9cwill trump make a deal with the cia on jfk records xe2 x80 x9d the cia is between a rock and a hard place non the one hand it knows that those records will further implicate the cia in the kennedy assassination non the other hand it knows that by seeking continued secrecy it xe2 x80 x99s essentially an implicit acknowledgment of guilt nnot surprisingly it is choosing the latter course especially because it knows that its assets and allies in the mainstream press will continue to come to its defense with respect to its ridiculous claim of xe2 x80 x9cnational security xe2 x80 x9d ndo the cia xe2 x80 x99s longsecret records contain a videotaped confession nof course not nand they don xe2 x80 x99t contain any reference to assassinating kennedy nthe cia xe2 x80 x99s practice from the very beginning has been to not put any reference to a statesponsored assassination into writing nbut there has to be a reason why the cia chose to keep this particular batch of records secret for more than 50 years nthose longsecret records undoubtedly include small bits of important circumstantial evidence that fill out even further the mosaic of a regimechange operation that took place in dallas in november 1963 the same types of regimechange operation that took place in iran in 1953 guatemala in 1954 cuba in 19601963 congo in 1961 and chile in 1973 all of which the cia steadfastly kept secret from the american people nin 1953 the cia was in the process of developing a topsecret manual on assassinations one that showed that the cia was specializing not only in the art of assassination but also in the art of covering up its role in statesponsored assassinations nevery american owes it to himself to read that manual ntoo bad the mainstream press has never given that manual the consideration it deserves nif it did it might not be so deferential to the deal that trump and the cia are about to make to continue the jfk assassination coverup by continuing to keep some of the cia xe2 x80 x99s decadesold jfk xe2 x80 x99s related assassination records secret

is that nnot likely at all ninstead it is a virtual certainly that when art of the deal trump sent out those two tweets he was sending a message to the cia as part of the negotiations give me what i want or i will release the records nin the negotiations both trump and the cia knew that trump was in the catbird seat nthe kennedy autopsy jacob hornberger check amazon for pricing nin the end the cia blinked just as trump knew it would ncontrary to what the mainstream press is asserting the records undoubtedly contain more incriminating circumstantial evidence that fills in the mosaic of a us nationalsecurity regimechange operation on november 22 1963 nthat xe2 x80 x99s what the mainstream media forever wedded to the official story no matter how ridiculous and illogical it is simply cannot bring themselves to confront ntrump knew that he had the cia over a barrel nas i indicated in my two articles this week the cia was between a rock and a hard place non the one hand it could refuse to grant trump what he wanted and let the records be released which it knew would point to the cia xe2 x80 x99s guilt in the assassination non the other hand it could give trump what he wanted and have to suffer the obvious inference that people would draw xe2 x80 x94 that the cia was continuing to cover up incriminatory evidence nwhat did the cia give trump in return for trump xe2 x80 x99s extending the cia xe2 x80 x99s 50yearplus secrecy nwe don xe2 x80 x99t know but my hunch is that it pertains to russia nhere xe2 x80 x99s my next prediction the congressional investigations into trump xe2 x80 x99s supposed xe2 x80 x9ccollusion xe2 x80 x9d with russia are about to fizzle out nthat xe2 x80 x99s because i believe that the cia as part of its deal with trump will order its assets in congress to cease and desist with respect to that investigation nin my opinion that xe2 x80 x99s the price the cia had to pay in return for its continued coverup of its us regimechange operation in november 1963 nnotice something else about the deal that trump has presumably made with the cia the secrecy arrangement extends only to april nostensibly the next six months are needed to carefully review the records to determine whether the records really to relate to xe2 x80 x9cnational security xe2 x80 x9d regime change the jfk jacob hornberger check amazon for pricing nnot surprisingly the mainstream media isn xe2 x80 x99t even questioning that ludicrous notion nfor more than 50 years the cia has known why it has wanted those particular records to be kept secret nduring the term of the assassination records review board in the 1990s the cia decided to keep these particular records secret for another 25 years nthere are bound to be lots of cia memoranda detailing why it was imperative to keep these particular records secret for as long as possible nfinally the cia made its request for secrecy to trump at least several weeks ago nthe notion that the cia suddenly hit trump yesterday with a new argument as to why xe2 x80 x9cnational security xe2 x80 x9d would be threatened after trump had supposedly already rejected the arguments that had been presented to him causing trump to suddenly change his mind is well laughable nso why the april deadline nwhy not extend the secrecy for another 25 years which is undoubtedly what the cia wanted nbecause trump obviously needed collateral to ensure that the cia complied with its part of the deal nif trump had extended the secrecy for 25 years he would have lost leverage to ensure that the cia complied with its part of the bargain nlet xe2 x80 x99s say hypothetically that i xe2 x80 x99m right that the cia agreed to use its assets in congress to shut down the russia investigation nto make certain that the cia fulfills its part of the bargain trump would need the april deadline so that the threat of the records release would continue hanging over the cia nif the cia fails to fulfill its part of the bargain trump releases the records in april nif the cia squelches the russia investigations trump grants another extension of time in april nlet xe2 x80 x99s state the obvious the cia records that are still being suppressed have nothing to do with xe2 x80 x9cnational security xe2 x80 x9d they have everything to do with covering up the cia xe2 x80 x99s role in the us nationalsecurity regimechange operation that took place in dallas in november 1963 which succeeded in ousting from power a president who was in the eyes of the us nationalsecurity establishment engaged in actions the cia terrorism an jacob hornberger check amazon for pricing nthat constituted a grave threat to xe2 x80 x9cnational security xe2 x80 x9d ie befriending the russians ie the soviets and cubans and entering into peaceful coexistence with the communist world nin other words unlike lee harvey oswald who had absolutely no motive to kill president kennedy the national security establishment did have motive a powerful motive the same motive that motivated the cia and pentagon to target other political leaders for regime change or assassination around that time such as mohamad mossadegh jacobo arbenz patrice lumumba who kennedy admired fidel castro and salvador allende nfor a more detailed analysis of motive read fff xe2 x80 x99s ebook jfk xe2 x80 x99s war with the national security establishment why kennedy was assassinated by douglas horne who served on the staff of the assassination records review board in the 1990s nimmediately upon the arrest of lee harvey oswald the official account was that this was just a lone nut former us marine communist who decided for no apparent reason to assassinate kennedy none big problem is the official story however requires a suspension of logic and common sense nfor anyone who has a mindset of conformity and deference to authority that story makes sense because nothing is questioned or challenged nfor anyone who has a critical analytical independent mindset the official story is filled with holes nfor example how many communist marines have you ever heard of nwhy would a genuine communist join the marines in the first place especially since the marines had just recently killed millions of north korean communists nwhy would a genuine communist join the marines knowing that he could be called upon at any moment to go to korea laos vietnam europe or elsewhere to kill fellow communists nhow many communists do you know who like to kill fellow communists nit gets better ncia  jfk the secret  jefferson morley check amazon for pricing nafter oswald supposedly tried to defect to the soviet union and promised us embassy officials in moscow that he was going to deliver classified information to the soviet union which was america xe2 x80 x99s sworn cold war enemy and former world war ii partner and ally us officials permitted him to return home with a red wife without even one grandjury summons or even an iota of harassment nthink about martin luther king john walker lindh edward snowden the us communist party or the fair play for cuba committee nthink about how the us nationalsecurity establishment treats what it suspects are communists or traitors nit skewers them nwhy just look at how they call julian assange a traitor and he isn xe2 x80 x99t even an american nrecall the mccarthy hearings ndalton trumbo nthe entire us anticommunist crusade including vietnam which more than 58000 us soldiers died killing communists nand they xe2 x80 x99re going to tell us that they just let lee harvey oswald a supposed selfavowed communist skate blissfully across the cold war stage of history with nary any abuse or harassment at all ndon xe2 x80 x99t make me laugh nsoon after the warren commission was established warren called a supersecret meeting of the commission to address information that had come into warren xe2 x80 x99s possession nthat information was that oswald was actually working for us intelligence nyes a spy the type of people that work for the cia nthat would make sense especially given that the marine corps is a prime recruiting place for the cia nsemper fidelis nnow suddenly all the circumstantial evidence in the kennedy assassination falls into place nit begins to make sense nthe mosaic starts to be filled out they needed to get rid of kennedy to protect national security and elevate johnson who had the same anticommunist mindset as the pentagon and the cia to the presidency nunlike jfk who had begun withdrawing troops from vietnam johnson would the man who killed ken roger stone check amazon for pricing nprotect national security by sending more troops to vietnam nbut to avoid detection they needed a patsy which is the term that oswald used after his arrest nthey needed to frame someone for the crime nand what better person to frame than a communist or an intelligence agent who the public would believe was a communist npart of the scheme obviously would be to establish oswald xe2 x80 x99s communist bona fides nthat xe2 x80 x99s why he was sent to new orleans where contradictorily he would work for a rightwing business owner work with a rightwing former fbi agent and conduct a public protest in favor of fidel castro and cuba nit was also why he was sent to mexico city where he would be ordered to visit the cuban and soviet embassies no doubt being told that he was being prepared for an important mission maybe to enter cuba to assassinate castro nbut no government operation ever goes perfectly nthings obviously went dreadfully wrong with the mexico city operation because the investigation into it after the assassination was quickly shut down ntoday it remains shrouded in mystery nand guess what is included in the records that trump has now agreed to continue suppressing nyou guessed it nthe cia xe2 x80 x99s records relating to mexico city never since the assassination the cia has argued that the release of any of its jfk records would threaten xe2 x80 x9cnational security xe2 x80 x9d one thing is for sure and undeniable despite the release of many of the cia xe2 x80 x99s records in the 1990s and yesterday the united states did not fall into the ocean or fall

academics one could have hoped to meet nto me the fact that he has chosen to write to express his concern about the crisis in the church and the papacy is very significant n nhe is neither a traditionalist nor a controversialist but a humble and straightforward friar who is clearthinking and entirely loyal to the church and her teaching ni would be surprised now if we were not see more of this sort of letterexercise of conscience ni imagine that it xe2 x80 x99s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence xe2 x80 x9d nwhen i posted it this assessment was backed up by joseph shaw the head of the uk xe2 x80 x99s latin mass society and the spokesman for the filial correction who wrote xe2 x80 x9cthis is absolutely right nnot a man to seek out confrontation xe2 x80 x9d n nthe crux piece offered a succinct bullet point list of fr nweinandy xe2 x80 x99s concerns nhe said the pope is xe2 x80 xa6 nfostering xe2 x80 x9cchronic confusion xe2

supreme shepherd xe2 x80 x9d nour friend edward pentin has reproduced the full text of the letter at the national catholic register which is definitely worth a read nfr nweinandy sent the letter to the pope on july 31 the feast of st ignatius of loyola nlike the dubia cardinals he said he made it public only after the pope had ignored it for months n nnotable in his critique is its distinct pastoral flavour his concern on the effect the situation is having on ordinary people nthe pope he said seems xe2 x80 x9cto censor and even mock xe2 x80 x9d critics of amoris laetitia for their desire to interpret it in keeping with catholic teaching and in doing so is committing a xe2 x80 x9ckind of calumny xe2 x80 xa6alien to the nature of the petrine ministry xe2 x80 x9d n nin an interview with crux weinandy said he is not afraid of reprisals but xe2 x80 x9cmore concerned about the good that my letter might do xe2 x80 x9d the letter xe2 x80 x9cexpresses the concerns of many more people than just me ordinary people who xe2 x80 x99ve come to me with their questions and apprehensions ni wanted them to know that i listened xe2 x80 x9d n n xe2 x80 x9ci have done what i believe god wanted me to do1 xe2 x80 x9d he said n nin fact fr nweinandy has bolstered my own xe2 x80 x9cgreat clarifier xe2 x80 x9d theory saying that this pontificate and the lack of response to it from priests and bishops is being allowed by god in order to reveal xe2 x80 x9cjust how weak is the faith of many within the church xe2 x80 x9d he added that francis has revealed that many in the church xe2 x80 x9chold harmful theological and pastoral views xe2 x80 x9d n nwhich inevitably brings to mind other responses that have not been quite so clear nor so pastoral n nwhen cardinal muller was removed abruptly from his position as head of the cdf the conservative catholic world wailed that it was another case of a xe2 x80 x9cgood xe2 x80 x9d prelate being got rid of nand it seems clear from the way it was done and the way francis treated muller in general that he was indeed got rid of nbut his depiction by conservative writers as a beleaguered champion of catholic orthodoxy persecuted by the regime for his faithfulness betrays a somewhat selective memory and short attention span ned pentin has a long file of interviews and articles about muller that clearly show his complete inability to make up his mind whose side he xe2 x80 x99s on n na quick examination of muller xe2 x80 x99s interviews and statements reveal an irresolute and ultimately calculating mind of a man who is xe2 x80 x93 so i am told by sources close to him xe2 x80 x93 motivated mainly by a puerile desire to be approved of by the xe2 x80 x9ccool kids xe2 x80 x9d in the vatican on the one hand and an unshakeable conviction of his own theological brilliance on the other n nmost recently on october 30th crux quoted him under the headline xe2 x80 x9ccardinal muller backs pope francis against critics of xe2 x80 x98amoris laetitia xe2 x80 x99 xe2 x80 x9d in which the former head of the cdf has at last climbed on board the kasperian train on reception of communion for unrepentant adulterers n nsignaling furiously with the trendy francischurch buzzwords and even trendier blithering incoherence muller writes that xe2 x80 x9cmitigating factors in guilt xe2 x80 x9d can lead couples in xe2 x80 x9can uncertain marital situation xe2 x80 x9d through a xe2 x80 x9cpath of repentance xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x93 always xe2 x80 x9caccompanied xe2 x80 x9d by an exquisitely sensitive confessor xe2 x80 x93 to a point where the reception of communion is no longer sinful npresumably because adultery itself is no longer sinful nor sacrilege either i guess nor something nsomehow the xe2 x80 x9cnew evangelization xe2 x80 x9d is involved in this though it xe2 x80 x99s unclear how exactly it makes adultery and sacrilege ok also it xe2 x80 x99s very important to fulfill the sunday mass obligation and as everyone knows one can xe2 x80 x99t possibly go to mass on a sunday without receiving communion n nwe hear again as we did incessantly from the kasperians at the synods about the hard case of the poor poor woman who has been abandoned by the first husband and who xe2 x80 x9cfinds no other way out than to entrust oneself to a kindhearted person xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 xa6 with whom i guess she has also no choice but to have sexual relations nbecause of kindheartedness n nanyway the result of this is a xe2 x80 x9cmarriagelike relationship xe2 x80 x9d about which confessors have to be very careful not to say mean things nor be too xe2 x80 x9cextreme xe2 x80 x9d nit xe2 x80 x99s very important for him to avoid a xe2 x80 x9ccheap adaptation to the relativistic zeitgeist xe2 x80 x9d on one side and a xe2 x80 x9ccold application of the dogmatic commandments and the canonical rules xe2 x80 x9d on the other nbecause that could be too polarizing nand mean n nand anyway sins of the flesh aren xe2 x80 x99t the worst things ever nthere are like xe2 x80 x9cdifferent levels xe2 x80 x9d of gravity you know nand like it depends on the type of sin right n xe2 x80 x9cspirit xe2 x80 x99s sins xe2 x80 x9d like spiritual pride and avarice and stuff are worse than xe2 x80 x9csins of the flesh xe2 x80 x9d you know nwhich are like only a result of xe2 x80 x9chuman weakness xe2 x80 x9d right n napparently the real problem with this whole thing has been that the kasperian kerfuffle has totally been blown way way way out of proportion and the xe2 x80 x9cpolarization xe2 x80 x9d it has caused has been xe2 x80 x9cregrettable xe2 x80 x9d nthe question of communion for divorced and civilly xe2 x80 x9cremarried xe2 x80 x9d catholics he said has been xe2 x80 x9cfalsely elevated to the rank of a decisive question of catholicism and a measure of ideological comparison in order to decide whether one is conservative or liberal in favor or against the pope xe2 x80 x9d n nfor years under pope benedict muller was engaged in an open war with the german episcopate who insisted that they were going to allow communion for the divorced and remarried no matter what rome said even threatening to go into schism if they didn xe2 x80 x99t get their way2 n nmuller with little backing from pope benedict xe2 x80 x93 who appeared content to allow his cdf prefect and the germans shout out their differences xe2 x80 x93 and with outright opposition from francis did indeed strive to hold the line nthe fact that francis orchestrated the synods to undermine him was certainly not his fault nand it is difficult to imagine anyone being in a worse position than he was at the time n nbut since then muller has demonstrated very little of his former grit instead attempting from one day to the next to appease both sides nreportedly removed from cdf xe2 x80 x93 and of course lionized by xe2 x80 x9cconservatives xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x93 for his mild and equivocating opposition to amoris laetitia muller has gone back and forth in what can easily be seen as a desperate attempt to find friends in both camps nwith this in mind one could be forgiven for not taking his october 30th essay too seriously n nperhaps one of the good effects to come from fr nweinandy xe2 x80 x99s persecution will be to demonstrate how a pastor of the catholic church is supposed to act nas my friend said maybe xe2 x80 x9cit xe2 x80 x99s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence xe2 x80 x9d assuming there are any left n ncatch hilary regular column in the

specifically answered xe2 x80 x9cif you want me to write something you have to give me a clear sign xe2 x80 x9d weinandy recalls saying n xe2 x80 x9ctomorrow morning i xe2 x80 x99m going to saint mary

57,the cunning cia n nwhatever else might be said about the assassination of president kennedy one thing is for sure the coverup of this particular us regimechange operation was one of the most ingenious and cunning plots ever designed nthis shouldn xe2 x80 x99t surprise anyone given that practically from its inception in 1947 the cia was specializing in the arts of assassination regime change and coverup nas far back as 1953 the cia published an assassination manual that the cia succeeded in keeping secret from the american people for more than 40 years nit came to light in 1997 as a result of a freedom of information request nthat was around the time that the assassination records review board which was overseeing the mandatory release of jfkrelated assassination records of the cia and other federal agencies that had been kept secret from the american people since 1963 ntoday americans can read the cia xe2 x80 x99s assassination manual online ntitled xe2 x80 x9cstudy of assassination xe2 x80 x9d the manual spells out various ways to assassinate people nhere is what the manual states in part regarding the use of firearms nfirearms are often used in assassination often very ineffectively xe2 x80 xa6 npublic figures or guarded officials may be killed with great reliability and some safety if a firing point can be established prior to an official occasion nthe propaganda value of this system may be very high ntime to buy old us gold coins nthe manual also makes it clear that the cia was studying ways to assassinate people without being detected nnote the following excerpt nfor secret assassination either simple or chase the contrived accident is the most effective technique nwhen successfully executed it causes little excitement and is only casually investigated nit would be safe to assume that the cia continued developing and expanding on the assassination principles enunciated in that early assassination manual nthat xe2 x80 x99s what we would expect from an agency whose specialties included assassination nwe can also assume that the cia continued to refine the ways to avoid detection when assassinating someone nthe kennedy autopsy jacob g hornberger best price 985 buy new 995 as of 0335 edt  details nthe cia published that secret assassination manual as part of its preparations for a us regimechange operation in guatemala one that was designed to violently remove the nation xe2 x80 x99s democratically elected socialist president jacobo arbenz from office and replace him with an unelected rightwing prous military general nas part of the guatemala regimechange operation the cia prepared a list of guatemalan officials to be assassinated nwhile the cia has never revealed the names of the people it targeted for assassination there is little doubt that arbenz the president was at the top of the list nthere is something important to note neither arbenz nor any other guatemalan official had ever attacked the united states or even threatened to do so nso why were they targeted for assassination nbecause arbenz had reached out to the russians and cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship just as john kennedy would do ten years later nthat xe2 x80 x99s why the cia targeted guatemala for regime change and why it targeted arbenz and other guatemalan officials for assassination nalthough arbenz was able to escape the country the cia xe2 x80 x99s regimechange operation was a total success with arbenz being replaced by the prous gen carlos castillo armas who proceeded to instigate a reign of terror across guatemala nthe guatemalan operation was brilliant and ingenious nthe cia officials were secretly honored for protecting xe2 x80 x9cnational security xe2 x80 x9d by removing president arbenz from office and replacing him with a prous military general ntracy barnes one of the cia officials responsible for the operation was awarded the distinguished intelligence medal the cia xe2 x80 x99s secondhighest medal nthe cia xe2 x80 x99s coverup in the jfk assassination was even more brilliant and ingenious nthe doctors at parkland hospital stated that president kennedy had a big exitsized wound in the back of his head which implied a shot having been fired from the front nat a press conference immediately after the president died two treating physicians stated that the other wound xe2 x80 x94 the one in the front of kennedy xe2 x80 x99s neck xe2 x80 x94 was an entry wound which implied that kennedy had been hit by another shot fired from the front nthis necessarily meant that kennedy had been shot from the front not the rear where accused assassin lee harvey oswald was situated nkeep in mind something important after he was arrested oswald claimed his innocence nbut he also went a step further nhe said that he was being framed for the crime nthe obvious question arises why frame an innocent man who is situated in the rear by killing the president with shots fired from the front nwouldn xe2 x80 x99t it be more logical to either have the shots fired from the rear where oswald was or alternatively place oswald in the front where the shots were fired nthat xe2 x80 x99s where the brilliance ingenuity and cunningness of the coverup come into play nif oswald is in the rear and since shots are fired from the front that could mean only one thing that oswald had confederates firing from the front nwho would those confederates be nthere could be only one answer communists nsoviet and cuban communists to be more specific nhow would we know this nthat xe2 x80 x99s where oswald xe2 x80 x99s trip to mexico city right before the assassination comes into play nregime change the jfk jacob hornberger check amazon for pricing noswald traveled to mexico city where he purportedly visited the soviet and cuban embassies and where he supposedly met with a premier assassin for the soviet union nkeep in mind that this was the height of the cold war between the united states and that the cuban missile crisis which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war had taken place the previous year nso president kennedy has been assassinated noswald is immediately arrested nhe has confederates firing from the front who almost certainly are soviet and cuban communists especially since oswald has supposedly just recently visited the soviet and cuban embassies in mexico city nwhat does all that mean nan assassination of the president by the soviet union and cuba is obviously an act of war nthat means nuclear war is about to break out because there is no way that the united states is going to sit idly by when the reds have just assassinated america xe2 x80 x99s president nexcept for one thing the communist part and the nuclearwar part were concocted nthat was all part of the plan nthat was the ingenious way that the cia was able to get the investigation into the assassination squelched just as soon as oswald was murdered nin the early days of the warren commission commission chairman earl warren called a topsecret meeting of the commission nits purpose was to discuss information that warren had received that oswald was actually a us intelligence agent or an informant for the fbi or both nhow did warren resolve this troubling issue nhe simply asked the heads of the cia and fbi whether it was true nthey said no nthat was the end of the matter nthe issue was so sensitive that warren ordered the members of the commission to never reveal the meeting to the american people nhe ordered all notes and other written references to be destroyed nhe also ordered the court reporter to destroy her notes of the meeting nunbeknownst to him the court reporter inadvertently kept a recording of the meeting that ultimately came to light nthis troubling issue arose again yesterday november 2 in the washington post in an article entitled xe2 x80 x9ctantalizing mystery of jfk assassination files solved xe2 x80 x93 23 years ago xe2 x80 x9d in the article author ian shapira points out that among the longsecret cia records that were recently released was a deposition of former cia director richard helms taken in 1975 before the president xe2 x80 x99s commission on cia activities which stated as follows nbelin well now the final area of my interrogation relates to charges that the cia was in some way conspiratorially involved with the assassination of president kennedy nduring the time of the warren commission you were deputy director of plans is that correct nhelms i believe so nbelin is there any information involved with the assassination of president kennedy which in any way shows that lee harvey oswald was in some way a cia agent or an agent xe2 x80 xa6 the cia terrorism an jacob hornberger check amazon for pricing nthat xe2 x80 x99s where the transcript ends according to few secret records of the cia that were recently released by the national archives nshapira points out xe2 x80 x9cseveral news organizations including the washington post seized on the truncated file as an example of the government xe2 x80 x99s continued secrecy about the assassination xe2 x80 x9d shapira points out that helms xe2 x80 x99 full deposition has been in the public arena since 1994 nthe year 1994 was during the tenure of the assassination records review board the agency charged with securing the mandated release of jfk assassination records from the cia and other federal agencies nthe arrb had been formed after americans had learned of the official secrecy after watching oliver stone xe2 x80 x99s movie jfk which posited that the jfk assassination was a us regimechange operation no different in principle from the one the cia had carried out in guatemala nine years before nshapira then proceeds to provide the answer that helms gave which as he points out has been public nhelms mr belin this question and i think you may recall this was raised at the time and the agency was never able to find any evidence whatsoever and we really searched that it had any contact with lee harvey oswald nas far as the fbi was concerned my recollection is not all that precise ni believe that mr hoover testified that he had not been an agent of theirs either nhe was certainly not an agent of the cia nhe was certainly never used by the cia nwhether any cia officer ever talked to him any place or not i don xe2 x80 x99t know but i certainly felt quite comfortable xe2 x80 x94 i believe mr john mccone a previous cia director was asked to testify before the commission on this point ni believe he was asked to testify nit was a hot item anyway at the time nand my recollection is that i informed mr mccone that we could find no evidence that oswald had any connection with the cia nshapira ends his article by suggesting that commentators should do more complete research maybe even use google before they jump to conclusions nbut shapira would be wise to follow his own advice because he himself is guilty of what he accuses others of nthat xe2 x80 x99s because he failed to conclude his article with one great big important point about former cia director richard helms nwhat is that great big important point that shapira who according to his tagline on his article xe2 x80 x9cenjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities xe2 x80 x9d left out of his article nperjury nhe left out that former cia director richard helms was a perjurer na liar na cia official who would tell falsehoods even under oath whenever he felt that xe2 x80 x9cnational security xe2 x80 x9d required it nshapira failed to note that helms was convicted in a federal district court of lying to congress under oath about another cia regimechange operation ten years after the kennedy assassination in chile ninteresting enough in the chile regimechange operation the cia and the pentagon were telling their counterparts in the chilean nationalsecurity establishment that they had a moral duty to violate their nation xe2 x80 x99s constitution and violently remove their nation xe2 x80 x99s democratically elected president salvador allende from office nthe reason nallende was reaching out to the russians and cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship just as arbenz had done and just as kennedy had done njfku2019s war with the douglas horne check amazon for pricing nthus given that helms was an admitted perjurer and convicted liar what value does his denial that oswald was an intelligence agent have nit has no value at all nand shapira who xe2 x80 x9cenjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities xe2 x80 x9d had an ethical duty to point out helms xe2 x80 x99 proclivity for lying in his article nthe circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly establishes that oswald was working for us intelligence nhow often have you ever heard of a us marine communist nif oswald was a genuine communist why would he have joined the marines in the 1950s given that the marines hated communists and had just helped kill millions of them in the korean war nwhy would a genuine communist want to join an organization in which he could be ordered on a moment xe2 x80 x99s notice to return to korea or be sent to vietnam laos china the soviet union or europe to kill communists ndon xe2 x80 x99t forget this is the height of the cold war nafter oswald supposedly tried to xe2 x80 x9cdefect xe2 x80 x9d to the soviet union and promised to give the russians all the secrets he learned about in the military why would us officials agree to let him back in the country and with a communist wife nwhy wouldn xe2 x80 x99t they indict him or at least haul him before a federal grand jury to testify as to what secrets he gave the russians nwhy wouldn xe2 x80 x99t they harass abuse humiliate persecute or prosecute him like they did to martin luther king dalton trumbo john walker lindh chelsea manning edward snowden and other people they have deemed to be communists or traitors nhow is it possible that oswald could learn fluent russian while serving in the us military without having us military tutors teaching him nhow is it possible that a veteran who embarrasses the us marine corps by openly proselytizing for communism in new orleans is able to saunter across the cold war stage of history not long after the mccarthy hearings without nary a care in the world nthe answer helms lied nthere is no reasonable doubt that oswald was a us intelligence agent one who was ordered to travel to mexico city to set the framework for his frameup nbut things obviously went dreadfully wrong in mexico city which is why the cia had to shut down that part of the postassassination investigation nnot surprisingly the cia xe2 x80 x99s mexico city operations regarding oswald are among the 98 percent of the records that trump and the cia have chosen to continue keeping secret from the american people on grounds of xe2 x80 x9cnational security xe2 x80 x9d of course nthus when oswald was claiming that he was being framed there could be only one entity that he could have been thinking about the cia the agency whose officials as former washington post investigative reporter jefferson morley has documented were secretly monitoring his activities in the weeks leading up to the assassination no doubt to ensure that oswald had not figured out what was about to happen to him nwe can assume that any frameup by the cia is going to be good nthe operation is going to be carefully planned and executed nbut no plan is perfect nthings are inevitably going to go wrong nthe pieces aren xe2 x80 x99t going to fit together perfectly nthe mexico city operation is a good example of that nthat xe2 x80 x99s why the cia has to continue keeping those records secret nbut here xe2 x80 x99s another example a small but important one recall that oswald supposedly hid the rifle before he headed down the steps from the sixth floor of the school book depository nask yourself if someone has just assassinated the president of the united states is he really going to take the time to hide the rifle nwhat good would that do nwouldn xe2 x80 x99t officials conduct a thorough search of the area nwouldn xe2 x80 x99t an assassin instead simply leave the rifle there and get out of there as soon as he could nthen why the hidden rifle nbecause it xe2 x80 x99s consistent with a frameup nthe framers had to hide the rifle in advance in a place where no one cia  jfk the secret  jefferson morley check amazon for pricing nwould see it during the morning of the assassination which took place after noon nno matter how good a frameup was the cia knew that it could be detected with an aggressive investigation nthat xe2 x80 x99s where ingenuity and cunning come into play nthey had to figure out a way to shut down the investigation so that the frameup would remain intact nthat xe2 x80 x99s why they had shots fired from the front and placed oswald in the rear nthe idea was that since an investigation would lead to oswald xe2 x80 x99s supposed communist confederates in the front which in turn would lead to nuclear war the investigation had to be shut down immediately especially since it was the cia itself that had started the assassination game by repeatedly attempting in partnership with the mafia to assassinate castro nit was one of the most brilliant and cunning ruses in history nthey get the body out of parkland by force in violation of texas law and put it in the hands of the military in maryland which conducts a secret fraudulent and bogus autopsy nsee my book the kennedy autopsy nlyndon johnson telephones dallas district attorney henry wade on the night of the assassination and orders him to shut down any investigation of a conspiracy because it might lead to nuclear war nas soon as oswald is assassinated the fbi orders wade to turn over all his investigative files to the fbi nat the same time deputy attorney general nicholas katzenbach and fbi head j edgar hoover both write secret memos and reports saying any further investigation must stop immediately nlyndon johnson gets earl warren and sen richard russel to join the warren commission by telling them that the assassination could lead to world war iii njohnson appoints former cia director allan dulles who kennedy had fired as a result of the cia xe2 x80 x99s regimechange operation at the bay of pigs to the warren commission thereby guaranteeing that there will be no investigation of the cia nthen keep all the records secret for decades when many people won xe2 x80 x99t care anymore who killed president kennedy nand employ operation mockingbirdlike journalistic assets in the private sector to flood the market with alternative xe2 x80 x9cconspiracy theories xe2 x80 x9d to confound and confuse the public nand smear anyone who questions the official narrative as a xe2 x80 x9ccommunist sympathizer xe2 x80 x9d or a xe2 x80 x9cconspiracy theorist xe2 x80 x9d nthe cia xe2 x80 x99s cunning coverup in the jfk assassination worked brilliantly nthanks to president trump and the cia xe2 x80 x99s decision to continue keeping 98

58,an antisemitic purge at mcgill university n n xe2 x80 x8bdespite suffering several public and humiliating reversals in various forums and venues those pushing for boycotts divestment and sanctions bds against israel have not dispensed with their pernicious campaign of hate nthe latest outrage perpetrated by bds activists occurred at mcgill university where a jewish student and two nonjewish students identified as proisrael were removed from their positions as directors of the students society of mcgill university ssmu nat the end of his second year noah lew who is currently third year undergraduate student at mcgill university applied to serve as director of the school xe2 x80 x99s student society nhe was warned by others who had prior dealings with the ssmu to keep his jewish identity secret lest he sabotage his chances nthis is the atmosphere that jewish students and supporters of israel must endure on a daily basis at mcgill nthe toxic environment is due almost exclusively to an active and vocal presence of bds agitators on campus nlew followed the advice and was elected as a board member nhis xe2 x80 x9csecret xe2 x80 x9d was intact nbds provocateurs at mcgill had relentlessly tried and failed to pass boycott resolutions against israel nin fact three attempts within an 18month period were quashed nfinally in june 2016 ssmu xe2 x80 x99s judicial board ruled that the bds campaign and efforts to institute it at mcgill ran counter to the mcgill xe2 x80 x99s undergraduate student union constitution nthe board xe2 x80 x99s ruling which is called a xe2 x80 x9creference xe2 x80 x9d was then referred to ssmu xe2 x80 x99s directors for ratification nssmu xe2 x80 x99s board of directors addressed the issue more than a year after the xe2 x80 x9creference xe2 x80 x9d lew and other board members passionately advocated in favor of ratification and their arguments ultimately prevailed over the naysayers nthe malevolent bds campaign at mcgill had belatedly come to an ignominious end or so we thought nlew and two other directors identified as either jewish or proisrael became instant targets of a campaign of hate laced with blatant antisemitic overtones ncampus bds groups held several meetings to formulate a response and founded the socalled xe2 x80 x9cdemocratize ssmu xe2 x80 x9d movement nbut democratize ssmu was anything but democratic nits raison d xc3 xaatre was to seek the removal of jewish and antibds students from ssmu xe2 x80 x99s board of directors and place bds back on the agenda nas an aside one of the more vocal proponents of bds at mcgill is a rancid character named igor sadikov who in february posted a comment on twitter advocating violence against xe2 x80 x9czionists xe2 x80 x9d as a result he was forced to resign his position as an ssmu director but dodged an impeachment effort to have him stripped of his position at mcgill xe2 x80 x99s arts undergraduate society nsadikov made light of his xe2 x80 x9cpunch a zionist xe2 x80 x9d tweet calling it a xe2 x80 x9cmisguided joke xe2 x80 x9d it does not appear that sadikov was subjected to any form of school disciplinary action despite the fact that his call for violence violated mcgill xe2 x80 x99s code of conduct nmcgill xe2 x80 x99s bds action network actively campaigned against lew and two other board members because of their links to jewish groups and antibds stances ndemocratize ssmu shamefully highlighted lew xe2 x80 x99s ethnicity as a reason for his removal nan enlightened progressive school was suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of nazi germany and the nuremberg laws nin october ssmu xe2 x80 x99s general assembly moved to ratify the 12member board of directors naccording to lew xe2 x80 x9chistorically the board of directors had been ratified as a bloc all 12 at a time xe2 x80 x9d but bds activists who showed up for the general assembly ratification forced the voting to occur on an individual basis rather than a block as was the accepted protocol nin this manner bds democratize ssmu activists managed to pick off their opponents one at a time nit was repulsive display leftistfascist bigotry at its worst nthe bigoted bds provocateurs applauded as lew and the other two board members were removed from their posts nbut this time they may have gone too far neven by bds standards their manifestly antisemitic campaign antics were beyond the pale nbds activists generally avoid reference to xe2 x80 x9cjews xe2 x80 x9d by name because it is impolitic and commonly substitute xe2 x80 x9czionists xe2 x80 x9d for jews even though most of us are cognizant of their true intentions nbut in the instant case mcgill xe2 x80 x99s bds campaigners dispensed with their traditional charade and overtly launched their attack against jews nthe vitriolic bds campaign immediately sparked outrage among watchdog groups and politicians prompting mcgill principal suzanne fortier to announce that the school would be conducting an investigation into the matter neven ssmu president muna tojiboeva voiced support for lew and expressed the belief that antisemitism played a key role in the ousting the three board members none can only hope that fortier takes the issue seriously and conducts a proper investigation which leads to disciplinary action njudging by past xe2 x80 x9cinvestigations xe2 x80 x9d conducted by other schools xe2 x80 x93 sfsu cuny and uci to name a few xe2 x80 x93 i am not optimistic n,"['appeal_to_fear-prejudice', 'repetition', 'loaded_language', 'slogans', 'doubt', 'bandwagon',

gregorian university in rome nnone other than francis appointed fr nweinandy to the international theological commission and awarded him the pro pontifice et ecclesiae medal the ecclesial equivalent of the congressional medal of honor for his work on behalf of the pope and the church none of the world xe2 x80 x99s most renowned theologians fr nweinandy is a xe2 x80 x9cman of the council xe2 x80 x9d and a prominent figure of the postconciliar mainstream nyet fr nweinandy xe2 x80 x99s letter sent to francis privately last summer but predictably ignored by him xe2 x80 x94along with every other private entreaty concerning his destructive activity xe2 x80 x94is a withering indictment of a papacy that constitutes nothing less than a menace to the church nthe key passages paragraph breaks added rebuke francis for his recklessness his deliberate ambiguity his fomenting of error his sowing of disunity his unheardof calumnies of the faithful and even his reduction of the faith to an ideology

unease xe2 x80 xa6 nin amoris laetitia your guidance at times seems intentionally ambiguous thus inviting both a traditional interpretation of catholic teaching on marriage and divorce as well as one that might imply a change in that teaching xe2 x80 xa6 nto teach with such a seemingly intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the holy spirit the spirit of truth nthe holy spirit is given to the church and particularly to yourself to dispel error not to foster it nyou seem to censor and even mock those who interpret chapter 8 of amoris laetitia in accord with church tradition as pharisaic stonethrowers who embody a merciless rigorism nthis kind of calumny is alien to the nature of the petrine ministry xe2 x80 xa6 nsuch behavior gives the impression that your views cannotsurvive theological scrutiny and so must be sustained by xe2 x80 x9cad hominem xe2 x80 x9d arguments ntoo often your manner seems to demean the importance of church doctrine nagain and again you portray doctrine as dead and bookish and far from the pastoral concerns of everyday life nyour critics have been accused in your own words of making doctrine an ideology nbut it is precisely christian doctrine xe2 x80 xa6 that frees people from worldly ideologies and assures that they are actually preaching and teaching the authentic lifegiving gospel nthose who devalue the doctrines of the church ie francis nseparate themselves from jesus the author of truth xe2 x80 xa6 what they ie francis then possess and can only possess is an ideology xe2 x80 x93 one that conforms to the world of sin and death nfaithful catholics can only be disconcerted by your choice of some bishops men who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to christian belief but who support and even defend them nwhat scandalizes believers and even some fellow bishops is not only your having appointed such men to be shepherds of the church but that you also seem silent in the face of their teaching and pastoral practice xe2 x80 xa6 nas a result many of the faithful who embody the sensus fidelium are losing confidence in their supreme shepherd nthe church is one body the mystical body of christ and you are commissioned by the lord himself to promote and strengthen her unity nbut your actions and words too often seem intent on doing the opposite xe2 x80 xa6 nyou have often spoken about the need for transparency within the church nyou have frequently encouraged xe2 x80 xa6 all persons especially bishops to speak their mind and not be fearful of what the pope may think nbut xe2 x80 xa6 what many bishops have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism but that you resent it xe2 x80 xa6 many fear that if they speak their mind they will be marginalized or worse ni have often asked myself why has jesus let all of this happen nthe only answer that comes to mind is that jesus wants to manifest just how weak is the faith of many within the church even among too many of her bishops nironically your pontificate has given those who hold harmful theological and pastoral views the license and confidence to come into the light and expose their previously hidden darkness xe2 x80 xa6 nfather weinandy reveals that he decided to publicize this historic missive only after receiving an unmistakable sign from heaven nas he recounts here after repeatedly xe2 x80

hardly believe that this just happened in a matter of a few minutes nbut there was no longer any doubt in my mind that jesus wanted me to write something ni also think it significant that it was an archbishop that jesus used ni considered it an apostolic mandate xe2 x80 x9d n ncan we doubt that it was indeed an apostolic mandate ncan we not see in fr nweinandy a voice raised up by heaven itself to say from deep within the postconciliar ecclesial establishment things that exceed in their candor what even certain traditionalist commentators have ventured to state nthis article is featured in the new printeedition of the remnant ncheck out the preview and subscribe today nas if to confirm the validity of his own indictment of this pontificate only a day after this letter was published the

investigations into the uranium one deal nwhat must be most annoying for the clinton team is that these investigations all started as a way to undermine the trump administration and continue to push connections between trump and russia nnow more than a year after the investigations began it xe2 x80 x99s looking less likely than ever that president trump did anything wrong xe2 x80 xa6 but the investigations seem to be zeroing in on key clinton team members including the clintons themselves non tuesday night fox news sean hannity sat down to talk about the exploding scandal that is the uranium one deal and what it could mean for the clinton family nhannity spoke with investigative reporter sara carter of circa john solomon of the hill and victoria toensing an attorney representing the fbi informant who allegedly possesses documents on the sale of canadian mining company xe2 x80 x98uranium one xe2 x80 x99 to russia interests back in 2010 nnow that the nda non disclosure agreement has been lifted circa xe2 x80 x99s sara carter is xe2 x80 x9creporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the fbi informant has knowledge of russia xe2 x80 x99s involvement in uranium one xe2 x80 x9d nnot to be outdone the hill xe2 x80 x99s john solomon had found even more dirt on this ugly clinton led deal napparently solomon has learned that the fbi informant xe2 x80 x9chas evidence was on the inside directly from putin xe2 x80 x99s russia the push for nuclear fuel deals and all the crimes we talked about bribery kickback extortion money laundering racketeering all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further ngo into your report xe2 x80 x9d nthis is all about to get very ugly nhttpsyoutubedferi21hlc nhannity breaking news tonight the hills john solomon investigative reporter sara carter they released bombshell reports equally tonight nsolomon reporting according to the memos obtained the fbi informant that now has had his nda lifted at the center of this case gathered years and years of evidence of russia xe2 x80 x99s plot to control us nuclear fuel which included the uranium one deal nand sara carter reporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the fbi informant has knowledge of russia xe2 x80 x99s involvement in uranium one nalso joining us now is the attorney for the fbi informant victoria toensing along with john and sara nsara let xe2 x80 x99s start with your report na treasure trove that is huge nsarah carter circa news it is sean ni mean there xe2 x80 x99s over 5000 documents which include emails briefs other documentation memorandums that the informant had turned over to the fbi and justice department and within these documents it xe2 x80 x99s very evident of russia xe2 x80 x99s intention to enter the american market energy market nand their intentions to acquire uranium one nhannity john you go into extensive detail in a very long and hardhitting piece tonight and revealing piece how the fbi informant xe2 x80 x94 you actually said six years i thought he was only an informant for four years nhe has evidence was on the inside directly from putin xe2 x80 x99s russia the push for nuclear fuel deals and all the crimes we talked about bribery kickback extortion money laundering racketeering all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further ngo into your report njohn solomon the hill you know sara just said something about the importance of the dominance of the uranium market nthis is an email that the fbi has had for six years nit shows that uranium one was part of a russia strategy to control not just benefit from the global market controlled the global market nthat would put the united states at a disadvantage nthat is the sort of evidence that this fbi informant has right now nif you go back on the last week we heard several things from the justice department there xe2 x80 x99s no connection to uranium one nthese are emails that say uranium one that are in the fbi files nthey said that there was no connection between the uranium one case and the criminal case nwe now know the criminal case got its first evidence in 2009 a whole year before the uranium one deal was approved by the obama administration nthere are a lot of things that people have been saying that these documents simply don xe2 x80 x99t agree with nhannity all right ni got a very high ranking congressman and that knows let us put it that way and actually sent me a note nthe knowledge of key administration officials will be the next thing proven by both of you and the links to the clinton foundation nsara is that true ncarter i believe that is true ni mean especially when we at xe2 x80 x94 nhannity do believe or you know ni can xe2 x80 x99t ask victoria that question because she won xe2 x80 x99t tell me ncarter i know it xe2 x80 x99s true ni know that looking at these documents following the money following the money is what xe2 x80 x99s important here nthe justice department has not pointed out that they will possibly call a special counsel to this nthis is still out there nthey are looking into it nthat is something that they need to decide nbut whether it xe2 x80 x99s a special counsel or whether it xe2 x80 x99s a prosecutor that is investigating this they will be able to follow the money nthere are somethings said xe2 x80 xa6 nhannity when you say follow the money my suspicion would go to the money came directly from russia was funneled through the canadian donors to the clinton foundation nhow good are my instincts ncarter you have pretty good instincts ni think there xe2 x80 x99s a lot of other areas that they will be looking at as well nremember this is like peeling back an onion nyou peel one part and then you find another part nand that is what xe2 x80 x99s going to require somebody to do an extensive investigation nhannity but it is beginning to cascade sara ncarter it is nhannity john i want her to respond to the same thing that the clinton foundation that this will be traced back to highranking obama administration officials and the clinton foundation and if you add the money portion sara mentioned nsolomon i do ni think the place we will be talking about in the next couple weeks as the clinton global initiative nsort of a side project of the clinton foundation nthere are new flows of money there that we will report on then the next couple of weeks nthere were also some personal business projects some very senior clinton people that got a remarkable infusion of cash from russia nit will be able to talk about that in the next couple of weeks nanother layer of interest of the story nhannity all right nwe have a lot of time in the segment so i want to go very slowly here nboth of you before i get to victoria sara and john you both in your pieces said 5000 documents ni hear the number the fbi informant is much much greater tens of thousands ntrue or false nsolomon that seems to be accurate nwe have a subset of the documents and they are very voluminous nhannity now let me go to victoria none of the great attorneys nshe is the most difficult to get any information out of nvictoria one of the things i xe2 x80 x99ve known about you and i xe2 x80 x99ve interviewed you so many times over the years you now have been doing a deep dive into all of this nyou are now representing this fbi informant ni think they will become an american hero out of all of this but apparently he was fighting and begging and pleading and saying the russians are here they are doing this why are you paying attention ni hope my instincts are right there and number two how devastating it legally is this going to be based on what i was just asking sara and john about impacting former obama officials money clinton foundation nvictoria toensing attorney representing fbi informant let me go to number one first that is the whole essence of what john and sara and i are talking about is that in 2009 2010 our fbi and presumably our justice department and the white house as my client was told all knew about this corruption in the russian nuclear energy area nthere xe2 x80 x99s no separate companies nthey are all related nthe russian nuclear energy is controlled from the top from putin nthey are all one nthey all talk to each other nso the evidence about this corruption was known to our government in 2009 2010 and why is it that cfius either wasn xe2 x80 x99t told or cfius people knowing about it xe2 x80 x94 nhannity explain cfius 13 agencies i am sorry 9 agencies approving the deal that gave control of uranium one to the bad actor hostile regime putin russia ntoensing they said the cfius board said that the bad russians could buy uranium one which contains access to 20 percent of the us nuranium why was that decision made nwas cfius told ndid bob mueller go to eric holder and tell him neric holder sat on it nhannity he was one of the nine ntoensing did bob mueller go to the white house and tell him nthe fbi agents told my client that they were briefing the president about his conduct nof course when the cfius decision was made nmy client said what happened nhannity back to my original question counselor if i may nyou are too good at your job nthis is a very serious point nputting your legal hat on objectively speaking yes they knew the evidence will prove it based on the documents and your client crimes committed on a high level nnational security compromise ntoensing of course it goes without saying giving the russians control of the uranium was a national security compromise ni think that we are going to have to do is continue to follow the money because the reporting that john and sara are going to be doing in a few days will be revealing about where lots of the various money went and where it came from nhannity always we go back and i believe at the end of this you guys deserve a pulitzer and i xe2 x80 x99m not the only one thinking that nyou have dug so deep on this this has been a deep dive and i applaud you both ni want to ask as it relates to who knew what and when nwhat did they know when did they know it john solomon ni xe2 x80 x99m talking about obama mueller eric holder and hillary clinton nsolomon we are at a little disadvantage right now because we don xe2 x80 x99t have those records and also the records that congress needs to go get but i can tell you i have a person quoted in my story who has direct knowledge of what the justice department knew nthis person said without a shred of doubt we knew in 2009 a year before cfius ruled that thomas were engaged in criminality without a shadow of a doubt we knew that russia was trying to gain a corner on the us market get a strong hold on our uranium and without a doubt we knew they were using political levers to try to get their way here nwe are talking about control like this document says they are trying to gain control of our markets nthat has to be national security interest that should have been raised in cfius nhannity president daily briefings were told nhad this information in it before cfius approves this ncarter sean nthat is what we need to find out nwe need to see those presidential daily briefings ncongress can get those nthey will be able to know whether or not president obama was briefed on this and according to a number of people that i have spoken with as well he was ni think that will reveal a whole other layer of who knew what where and when nand we follow the money and it will reveal even more about hillary clinton and what she knew and when did she know it and the other members of the cfius board nhannity and obama and holder and mueller njohn real quick we are running out of time nsolomon yes listen i think even sessions and rosenstein have questions to answer nthere are people in congress who don xe2 x80 x99t think they xe2 x80 x99ve gotten a straight answer from them nhannity all right nvictoria we get the last word from you laws broken ntoensing well of course nhannity you are so good at your job nyou are so annoyingly good nthe american people deserve the truth varied our security was compromised we import uranium because we don xe2 x80 x99t have enough nnewt gingrich will weigh in on this and more things and about the clintons nare they facing their day of

80,america  immigration voice n nkritarch patti saris thinks she runs immigration policy right down to how many times someone can have their case reviewed though she seems confused as to who will do the reviewing of those cases nat issue is a large group of indonesian chinese christians who fled a pogrom in indonesia directed against them in the 1990s nthe chinese generally filed asylum applications after arriving in the united states and importantly not at an american embassy or consulate in indonesia or nearby nall were relatively wealthy and had or obtained tourist visas to the united states nthis is important as most actual refugees drop everything to flee their homelands if they are under threat of death ntellingly these asylum applicants were the elite of indonesian society because their higher average iq than the rather dull indonesians n87 is the average indonesian iq  and note that average includes the higher average chinese so the locals really are a dull lot nthis is important in that while there was antichinese and antichristian violence the nonchinese christians mostly stuck around though the chinese used tourist and student visas to come to the united states in a leisurely manner taking time to either bring or otherwise secure their wealth in indonesia nin any event the persecution was limited in time and duration as the local elite know they need the chinese to run the economy and to avoid red china intervening on behalf of their fellow ethnics nin the united states these chinese went through the liberal asylum process but did not manage to fool even the credulous judges at the executive office for immigration review eoir the immigration courts nfast forward to the obama regime administrative amnesty  where despite outstanding deportation orders these illegal aliens among millions of others are allowed to remain and then given employment authorization as well nfortunately elections have consequences and the obama regime administrative amnesty or parts of it came to an inglorious end nand end it was for this particular lot of illegal aliens nbut kritarch patti saris was having none of the immigration laws of the united states nshe thought she was deciderinchief on who gets deported nand all on the flimsy excuse that the aliens need another bite at the apple despite the clear fact that the indonesian government had long ago quashed the ethnic riots directed against the market dominant minority of chinese and the religious motivated violence against christians nwhile there are a couple of provinces in indonesia that impose sharia law on muslims most nonmuslims are exempt nas moderates go indonesia is about as close as it gets to moderate muslims nmostly because the country would not last long without an outside high iq elite to run the country nbefore it was the high iq dutch now it  the chinese nremember an 87 iq is just about retarded na federal judge on monday ordered us immigration officials to delay any efforts to deport 51 indonesians living illegally in new hampshire so the group can have time to argue that changing conditions in that country would make it dangerous to return federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch not the courts nchief us district judge patti saris in boston found she had authority to ensure the indonesians have a chance to argue that conditions in their home country had deteriorated significantly enough to reopen their cases for trying to stay in the united state nshe worried that without the order ice officials could deport some of the indonesians covered by the suit at which time they would lose the opportunity to have their cases reopened njudge orders us to delay deporting indonesians in immigration fight by scott malone reuters november 27 2017 nkritarch saris thought she knew better and has been running a deliberate campaign to prevent the deportation of these chinese illegal aliens nand now she has gone full rogue prohibiting the deportation of all these illegal aliens who already had their day in immigration courtsaris appears to be making up immigration law and procedure on the fly as her order appears to not understand either the eoir process or immigration law n xe2 x80 x9cthe government shall inform the court whether petitioners who are not detained will have access to emergency procedures if they must file their original motions to reopen xe2 x80 x9d saris wrote nthis makes no sense in english much less in the established procedures in the eoir nthe aliens have no emergency there are no emergency procedures and their original motions to reopen were denied for lack of legal basis in law or any changed conditions in the country they are being deported to that would avail them of another claim nindonesia is more hospitable to chinese christians today than the short period in the 90s when there was a problem nbut basically saris wants the illegal aliens the opportunity to submit another asylum application and benefit by the years it will take to adjudicate those claims nbasically saris wants these illegals to never leave nthat of course is not her role nthe only claim they have before a federal court is if they got the due process that congress gave those illegal aliens nand they did they filed for asylum had a hearing and appeals and lost nwith the legislative fight over daca the trump administration needs to include legislative language including more restrictions on kritarchs who want to make american immigration policy as well as other reforms to lower legal immigration build the wall and deport illegals here nor impeachment or both n,"['repetition', 'loaded_language', 'causal_oversimplification', 'name_calling', 'labeling',

xe2 x80 x99s contention that the shooting was all a matter of chance nas it happens in russian roulette a shooter loads one bullet into a sixshot revolver spins the cylinder then puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger nin a central fact of the case zarate did not aim the gun at himself but fired in the direction of kate steinle nin another established fact the bullet struck her in the lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta nthis happened in broad daylight but as in in the heat of the night they had the body which was dead ngarcia zarate confessed to firing the shot and had gunpowder residue on his hands nafter firing he tossed the gun in the water nhe said he had found the stolen weapon wrapped in a cloth and that it discharged by itself both utterly unbelievable claims

the passions nbut now we are witness to the single worst act of tyranny in the entire history of the papacy nthe church has seen a number of popes who have abused their power alexander vi being the most popularly known example nbut never before francis has there been a pope who dared to tyrannize the magisterium itself by attempting to bend it to his errant personal opinions nby publication in the acta apostolicae sedis aas francis has officially declared that the xe2 x80 x9cauthentic magisterium xe2 x80 x9d includes the guidelines of the bishops of buenos aires for the implementation of chapter 8 of amoris laetitia al which he expressly approved in his letter to them as the only correct interpretation of his will nthe guidelines have been published in the aas along with francis xe2 x80 x99s private missive which is suddenly declared to be xe2 x80 x9can apostolic letter xe2 x80 x9d nthe normalist narrative has just been stripped of any colorable argument that nothing is too terribly amiss with this pontificate nwe are now expected to believe that the xe2 x80 x9cauthentic magisterium xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x94meaning simply and only al xe2 x80 x94teaches what the guidelines preposterously declare solely in reliance on al nwhen the concrete circumstances of a couple make it feasible especially when both are christians with a journey of faith one may propose that they commit to living in continence xe2 x80 xa6 n nin other more complex circumstances and when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity the aforementioned option may not in fact be viable nnonetheless it is equally possible to undertake a journey of discernment xe2 x80 xa6 nif one arrives at the recognition that in a concrete case there are limitations that diminish responsibility and culpability cf n301302 particularly when a person judges that he would fall into a subsequent fault by damaging the children of the new union amoris laetitia opens up the possibility of access to the sacraments of reconciliation and the eucharist cf nnotes 336 and 351 nas francis would have it then the xe2 x80 x9cauthentic magisterium xe2 x80 x9d has just flatly contradicted itself for the first time in two millennia nthe admission of public adulterers in xe2 x80 x9csecond marriages xe2 x80 x9d to holy communion which john paul ii in line with all of tradition called xe2 x80 x9c intrinsically impossible xe2 x80 x9d given their objective state in life is now deemed possible depending on circumstances xe2 x80 x94that is situation ethics applied to violations of the sixth commandment n nthe requirement that people embroiled in such unions commit to living in continence before they can be absolved and partake of the blessed sacrament xe2 x80 x94a moral norm binding xe2 x80 x9c without exception xe2 x80 x9d because it is rooted in divine law xe2 x80 x94is suddenly demoted to a mere xe2 x80 x9cproposal xe2 x80 x9d that may not be xe2 x80 x9cfeasible xe2 x80 x9d or xe2 x80 x9cviable xe2 x80 x9d in xe2 x80 x9cthe concrete circumstances of the couple xe2 x80 x9d na valid annulment of a truly invalid marriage the sine qua non for entering into marital relations with another purported spouse is now dispensed with in xe2 x80 x9cmore complex circumstances xe2 x80 xa6 when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity xe2 x80 x9d the way thus being opened to de facto divorce in the catholic church nthe meaningless slogan xe2 x80 x9cjourney of discernment xe2 x80 x9d cloaks a naked authorization for the official toleration of adulterous sexual relations in the church xe2 x80 x99s sacramental life nno less than a roman pontiff lends his name to the outrageous claim that children resulting from an adulterous relationship blithely referred to as a xe2 x80 x9cnew union xe2 x80 x9d could be xe2 x80 x9cdamaged xe2 x80 x9d if the partners in adultery were required to cease their adultery in order to be absolved and receive holy communion xe2 x80 x94evidently because the xe2 x80 x9cnew union xe2 x80 x9d would dissolve without adulterous sexual relations and there could be a second divorce nthis appeared in the last printedition of the remnant nsee what else you missed nsubscribe today nas recently as seventeen years ago during the reign of john paul ii the pontifical council for the interpretation of legislative texts reaffirmed the immutable truth reflected in canon 915 which prohibits the administration of holy communion to those xe2 x80 x9cwho obstinately persist in manifest grave sin xe2 x80 x9d that prohibition declared the pontifical council applies to the divorced and xe2 x80 x9cremarried xe2 x80 x9d not as a matter of mere disciplinary law subject to revocation or modification but rather xe2 x80 x9cis derived from divine law and transcends the domain of positive ecclesiastical laws and the latter cannot introduce legislative changes which would oppose the doctrine of the church xe2 x80 x9d nfrancis however has purported to do nothing less invent exceptions to divine law that oppose the doctrine of the church nthe attempt is void of course and the appellation xe2 x80 x9cauthentic magisterium xe2 x80 x9d is fraudulent nbut the consequences of this pope xe2 x80 x99s toying with the teaching office of the church to advance halfbaked theological notions such as xe2 x80 x9cdiscernment xe2 x80 x9d a term he borrows from st ignatius of loyola but strips of its original meaning are catastrophic nover the past year cardinal burke and a few other members of the hierarchy have called upon francis to xe2 x80 x9cclarify xe2 x80 x9d his intention respecting al nthat clarification has now been given francis intends if it were possible to change the unchangeable teaching of the church regarding an irrevocable moral norm rooted in divine law neven if the attempt is void and of no effect before man and god xe2 x80 x94an immoral law is no law at all xe2 x80 x94francis clearly means to impose his will by fiat daring invoke the xe2 x80 x9cauthentic magisterium xe2 x80 x9d to cloak his absurd novelties nno pope before him has ever dared to do such a thing nso now it must be asked where are the cardinals and the bishops nwith one or two noble however inconsistent exceptions their response to the bergoglian debacle thus far ranges from silence to active complicity to xe2 x80 x94at best xe2 x80 x94handwringing over the increasingly chaotic state of the church while begging the pope to xe2 x80 x9cclarify xe2 x80 x9d his already perfectly clear intentions nat this point continued pleading for a bergoglian xe2 x80 x9cclarification xe2 x80 x9d can only give rise to an impression of disingenuousness whereas continued silence about the papal origin of this ongoing catastrophe is a standing rebuke to all the hierarchs who know what we all know that at the epicenter of the chaos is the most wayward pope the church has ever had to endure ncontinued inaction while the laity and a few good priests are left to themselves to defend as best they can the constant teaching of the church against the abuses of a tyrant on the chair of peter threatens the hierarchs with a legacy of shame and a terrible accountability before the just judge ntheir failure to defend the faith by standing up to the one they know full well is attacking it almost daily lends itself ever more to an indictment for timidity in the face of unprecedented danger to the church and the cause of the gospel of which they are divinely charged to be leaders nthe time for xe2 x80 x9cprudence xe2 x80 x9d is long past nprudence now gives way to mere pusillanimity nthe time for hierarchical action is now before the damage to the church becomes irreparable nthe members of a hierarchy seemingly cowed by a papal tyranny the church has never before seen must rise immediately and give a courageous answer to the challenge posed long ago by monsignor klaus gamber when an already monumental ecclesial crisis was still in what can now can be seen as merely a preliminary stage nwhere in our church are the leaders who can show us the right path nwhere are the bishops courageous enough to cut out the cancerous growth of modernist theology that has implanted itself and is festering within the celebration of even the most sacred mysteries before the cancer spreads and causes even greater damage nwhat we need today is a new athanasius a new basil bishops like those who in the fourth century fought courageously against arianism when almost the whole of christendom had succumbed to heresy nwill none of the hierarchs rise to defend the church as xe2 x80 x9ca new athanasius a new basil xe2 x80 x9d neven the best among them continue to limit themselves to generalized lamentations at conferences or in interviews about the parlous state of the church or at most the xe2 x80 x9cconfusion xe2 x80 x9d francis has caused by not xe2 x80 x9cclarifying xe2 x80 x9d precisely what he has just clarified nthey avoid the absolutely necessary direct and public exposure of error at its source nthat error threatens to overwhelm the church while they do little more than fret about a situation whose selfevident cause xe2 x80 x94a reckless pope in love with his own ideas and filled with contempt for tradition xe2 x80 x94they seem incapable of identifying nconcerned clergy and laity throughout the catholic world are doing what they can according to their stations nbut in the midst of that xe2 x80 x9cfinal battle xe2 x80 x9d over marriage and family of which sister lucia warned the late cardinal caffarra in light of the third secret of fatima within the human element of the church only the cardinals and the bishops possess the divinely bestowed power to repel an assault on marriage family and the very integrity of the faith that is now for the first time in church history being led by a roman pontiff nthis undeniably apocalyptic development imposes upon the hierarchs xe2 x80 x94first and foremost in the church xe2 x80 x94the duty to act ntrue love for the church indeed true charity toward francis himself requires of them nothing less than what was required of saint paul when the first pope fell into error that jeopardized the very mission of the church that peter be withstood to his face gal n211 nmay our lady of fatima intercede to obtain for them the grace of fortitude to do what must be done and what only they can do nour hopes and prayers are with them as the foremost instruments of divine providence in the ecclesia dei adflicta nour lady of fatima intercede for us

advisors in his staff who don xe2 x80 x99t want to see the us isolated on the world stage nfortunately for trump however he is not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize iran at all costs non december 12 trump xe2 x80 x99s ambassador to the un nikki haley gave a grandiose speech demonizing iran that echoed colin powell xe2 x80 x99s infamous performance before the un in 2003 nhaley xe2 x80 x99s essential claim was that saudi arabia is under attack by missiles supplied to yemen by the iranian government and that the world should not sit idly by as this goes on n xe2 x80 x9cif we do nothing about the missiles fired at saudi arabia we will not be able to stop the violence xe2 x80 x9d haley warned n xe2 x80 x9cthere is clear evidence that the missiles that landed on saudi arabia come from iran xe2 x80 x9d she said n xe2 x80 x9cthe evidence is undeniable nthe weapons might as well have had xe2 x80 x98made in iran xe2 x80 x99 stickers all over it xe2 x80 x9d nbuy gold at discounted prices nhowever even as haley opened her mouth many commentators could already identify a number of issues with her speech nas common dream xe2 x80 x99s reza marashi explained n xe2 x80 x9chaley cited a un report in her claim regarding iranian missile transfers to the houthis nof course the un has reached no such conclusion ninstead a panel of experts concluded that fired missile fragments show components from an iranian company but they have xe2 x80 x98no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier xe2 x80 x99 asked about haley xe2 x80 x99s claim that iran is the culprit sweden xe2 x80 x99s ambassador to the un said xe2 x80 x98the info i have is less clear xe2 x80 x99 analysts from the us department of defense speaking to reporters at haley xe2 x80 x99s speech openly acknowledged that they do not know the missiles xe2 x80 x99 origin nperhaps most surreal is the very same un report cited by haley also says the missile included a component that was manufactured by an american company ndid she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remarks or fail to read the entire un report nthe world may never know xe2 x80 x9d nregardless of the fact that haley misrepresented the un report in question it appears the entire premise of the un report is almost completely incorrect anyway according to former inspector scott ritter nritter writes n xe2 x80 x9cthe missile debris in question actually contradicts the finding of the un panel which held that the missiles launched against saudi arabia had been transferred to yemen in pieces and assembled there by houthi missile engineers it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of yemen well before the saudi arabianled intervention of 2015 and that their source was either soviet or north korean nthe modification kits on the other hand appear to be of iranian origin and were transported to yemen via oman nthe un panel claims not to have any evidence of xe2 x80 x98external missile specialists xe2 x80 x99 working alongside the houthi indeed the simplicity of the burkhan 2h modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the scudb missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance xe2 x80 x9d emphasis added nso where did the missiles come from and who made them naccording to ritter n xe2 x80 x9crather than the iranianmanufactured qiam1 missiles haley and the saudi arabian government claimed the debris presented by haley were of a modified sovietmanufactured scudb missile the airframe and engine are original sovietmade components and many of the smaller parts on display bear cyrillic ie russian markings nthe transformation to the burkhan 2h design required the houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks and lengthen the airframe accordingly nthis is done by cutting the airframe and welding in place the appropriate segments this also required that the fuel supply pipe which passes through the oxidizer tank be similarly lengthened nthe difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable nthe increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn which in turn increases the range of the missile nthe burkhan 2h uses a smaller warhead than the scud b as such the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter and an interstage section added to connect the warheadguidance section with the main airframe xe2 x80 x9d n xef xbb xbf nthose who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the us has had little material evidence to link yemen xe2 x80 x99s houthis to iranian arms suppliers nin january of this year a panel of un experts stated n xe2 x80 x9cthe panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct largescale supply of arms from the government of the islamic republic of iran although there are indicators that antitank guided weapons being supplied to the houthi or saleh forces are of iranian manufacture xe2 x80 x9d emphasis added neven if iran were arming the houthis haley xe2 x80 x99s hypocritical antiiran rhetoric doesn xe2 x80 x99t excuse the us for continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed isis through us weapons transfers or for arming alqaeda xe2 x80 x99s affiliate in syria just to name two examples of washington xe2 x80 x99s schizophrenic approach to the region nwhy is the us singling out iran especially when the houthi rebels are sworn enemies of alqaeda nthe issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy naccording to ritter the entire debacle has shown that if saudi arabia cannot contain the houthi xe2 x80 x99s missile capabilities it cannot possibly hope to take on iran which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the houthis do on their own nritter explains further n xe2 x80 x9cif a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the houthi using iranianmodified soviet and north korean missiles derived from 40yearold technology can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering systems available and successfully launch ballistic missiles that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state what does that say about the prospects of any usled coalition taking on the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in north korea and iran today nthe fact of the matter is that no military anywhere has shown the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way a determined opponent armed with mobile ballistic missile capability nif the saudi experience in yemen is to teach us anything it is that any military plan designed to confront nations such as north korea iran and russia that are armed with sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles had better count on those capabilities remaining intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility nno amount of chestthumping and empty rhetoric by american political andor military leaders can offset this harsh reality nthis is the critical lesson of yemen and the united states would do well to heed it before

of marriage and the integrally related eucharistic discipline xe2 x80 x94he is still at it as of yesterday january 9 xe2 x80 x94he and his collaborators are busily engineering neopharisaical escape hatches from the negative precepts of the divine and natural law emanating from the sixth commandment ndetermined to quell any catholic opposition to his moral subversion francis has slapped the label

who are not married can be admitted to holy communion without ceasing extramarital sexual relations so long as they engage in an illdefined xe2 x80 x9cprocess of discernment xe2 x80 x9d as father brian harrison has so trenchantly observed this means that people embroiled in adultery can receive holy communion while they xe2 x80 x9cdiscern xe2 x80 x9d that they should not be receiving holy communion because they are embroiled in adultery ndo they think we are fools nthen there is the endlessly doubletalking cardinal m xc3 xbcller nin a recent interview concerning rocco buttiglione xe2

xc3 xbcller proposed this preposterous xe2 x80 x9csolution xe2 x80 x9d to a xe2 x80 x9cproblem xe2 x80 x9d that does not exist nit is possible that the penitent may be convinced in conscience and with good reasons of the invalidity of the first marriage even though they cannot offer canonical proof nin this case the marriage valid before god would be the second one and the pastor could grant the sacrament certainly with the appropriate precautions as not to scandalize the community of the faithful and not to weaken the conviction of marriage indissolubility nthe cardinal knows this is moral and canonical nonsense nno catholic whether or not he consults a priest can declare for himself that his marriage in the church was invalid especially when xe2 x80 x94indeed because xe2 x80 x94he lacks canonical proof of invalidity nmoreover absent an annulment granted by the competent church tribunal a purported xe2 x80 x9csecond marriage xe2 x80 x9d can only be an invalid civil ceremony and

culminating in amoris laetitia al has observed the obvious in this regard nsuch cases do not exist nno priest has the authority to declare a marriage null in the internal forum nmarriage is a public state in the church and the judgment regarding an accusation of nullity of marriage must be made in accord with the long practice of the church nif a college of judges in a matrimonial tribunal is not able to arrive at moral certitude regarding the nullity of a marriage after a careful and thorough examination of the petition of nullity how can an individual priest be capable of making such a judgment having to do with the eternal salvation of the soul in question nthe only case in which a priest could admit a person living in an irregular matrimonial union to receive the sacraments of penance and holy eucharist is the case of a couple who agree to live xe2 x80 x9cas brother and sister xe2 x80 x9d that is to respect the marriage to which they are bound by not living in a marital way with another person neven then the priest would have to insist that the couple living in continence receive the sacraments in a place in which they are not well known lest other faithful be led to believe that persons living in an irregular matrimonial union may receive the sacraments ndoes cardinal m xc3 xbcller think we are fools nsome of us apparently are or at least are willing to serve as knowing dupes by defending neopharisaical sophistry that would produce xe2 x80 x9ca discipline alien to the entire tradition of the catholic and apostolic faith xe2 x80 x9d napparently they think they

91,hungarian prime minister hits nail on the head refugees are actually muslim invaders n nhungarian prime minister viktor orban doesn t mince words when it comes to the muslim invasion in europe and specifically to his own country norban says there is not only muslim invaders in the mix of refugees but also xe2 x80 x9ceconomic migrants seeking better lives for themselves nindeed both of these are true nthere are plenty of these people who are simply happy to have a place to live after many were driven from their homes due to the us russia and other countries putting their noses where they didn t belong and funding training and arming islamic jihadis there nthen there are those who clearly come to the country to islamasize the country because they have an islamic dominionist attitude borne of the teachings of the koran and muhammad  nrt reports nrefugees in europe are just xe2 x80 x9cmuslim invaders xe2 x80 x9d and economic migrants seeking better lives hungarian pm viktor orban has said adding that the large number of muslims in the eu had led to the appearance of xe2 x80 x98parallel societies xe2 x80 x99 asked in an interview with the german bild newspaper why budapest does not want to accept any refugees orban replied xe2 x80 x9cwe don xe2 x80 x99t consider these people to be muslim refugees xe2 x80 x9d instead the toughtalking politician said they were regarded as xe2 x80 x9cmuslim invaders xe2 x80 x9d asylum seekers must cross four countries to reach hungary from syria all of which are not as rich as germany but are economically stable the pm said nhe was apparently referring to turkey greece macedonia and serbia xe2 x80 x93 a common route for migrants heading for xe2 x80 x98wealthy xe2 x80 x99 europe n xe2 x80 x9cso they are not running for their lives in these countries nthey are merely economic migrants seeking a better life xe2 x80 x9d orban concluded nhe stressed though that he can only speak for the hungarians and they xe2 x80 x9cdon xe2 x80 x99t want xe2 x80 x9d immigration nin his view the government simply can xe2 x80 x99t go against the will of the people nand orban has stayed the course too while governments like that of germany have ignored their people to allow for a clear invasion of germany that has led to untold numbers of sexual assaults by muslim migrants attacks on christians and there  no telling the amount of damage to the unethical welfare system in the country nrt continues ngoing further the prime minister noted that no refugee wants to go to portugal for example adding that the majority of asylum seekers simply wanted to live in prosperous germany n xe2 x80 x9cthe reason why people are in your country is not because they are refugees but because they want a german life xe2 x80 x9d he said describing the issue xe2 x80 x9cpolitically xe2 x80 x9d as a european problem but xe2 x80 x9csociologically xe2 x80 x9d as a german problem norban specifically targeted germany and chancellor angela merkel xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x98opendoor xe2 x80 x99 policy towards asylum seekers n xe2 x80 x9ci xe2 x80 x99ve never understood how chaos anarchy and illegal border crossings are viewed as something good in a country like germany which we view as the best example of discipline and the rule of law xe2 x80 x9d he said nthe recent wave of refugees reaching europe is merely an invasion according to orban n xe2 x80 x9cif someone wants to come to your house he knocks on your door and asks xe2 x80 x98can we come in can we stay xe2 x80 x99 they asylum seekers didn xe2 x80 x99t do that they crossed the border illegally xe2 x80 x9d he stated norban then did what most political representatives will simply not do he told the truth about multiculturalism nhe called it an illusion and said that christian and muslim societies xe2 x80 x9cwill never unite xe2 x80 x9d nof course they won t nthey have absolutely nothing in common nthey cannot agree on god  law which most western societies were base on including the united states nthey cannot agree on the scriptures nthey cannot agree on the person and work of jesus the christ nthey can t even agree on the means of proselytizing and of what real spiritual weapons are npm orban has remained consistent nhe has publicly told the muslim invaders to leave hungary and never come back nhe has rebuffed brussels which is largely islamic and told them that hungary would defend its borders and it has norban  border wall reduced illegal immigration by 99 nhe has genuinely reached out his hand to help christian migrants instead of muslim migrants and he seems to be one that holds to the christian faith as emulated by the protestant reformers saying that which serves the glory of god is the best for the people nfurthermore orban has also called out the man behind the curtain in a lot of the promoting of this muslim invasion of the west george soros nantijihadist activist pamela geller praised orban for his honesty and wrote at last a politician who speaks the truth about the muslim invasion of europe nand while orban is right that these are economic migrants  they are also muslim invaders  nthey don xe2 x80 x99t want a german life  in germany in the sense that they are willing to accept german values she added nmany all too many of them want to overwhelm german values and european values in general with sharia values nthey are in europe to conquer and islamize it with willing and eager help from europe xe2 x80 x99s shortsighted selfserving internationalist intelligentsia nindeed nthank you prime minister orban for saying what

92,doj unseals indictment involving uranium one scandal n nthis report was originally published by tyler durden at zero hedge nthe department of justice unsealed an 11count indictment on friday to a former dod intelligence analystturned uranium transportation executive who stands accused of a bribery and money laundering scheme involving a russian nuclear official connected to the uranium one deal nthe indictment corroborates a november report by the hill that an fbi mole deeply embedded in the russian uranium industry had gathered extensive evidence of the scheme nmark lambert 54 of mount airy maryland was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and to commit wire fraud seven counts of violating the fcpa two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering nthe charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe vadim mikerin a russian official at jsc techsnabexport tenex a subsidiary of russia xe2 x80 x99s state atomic energy corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of russian federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide in order to secure contracts with tenex naccording to the indictment beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until october 2014 lambert conspired with others at xe2 x80 x9ctransportation corporation a xe2 x80 x9d to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies at the direction of and for the benefit of a russian official vadim mikerin in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with tenex n xe2 x80 x93doj nwhile the indictment lists lambert xe2 x80 x99s company as xe2 x80 x9ctransportation corporation a xe2 x80 x9d a simple search reveals that lambert is the copresident of dahertli xe2 x80 x9cthe leading front end freight forwarding company dedicated to nuclear cargo xe2 x80 x9d according to its website nin 2012 the nuclear regulatory commission sent a letter to lambert with findings that tli had exported plutonium xe2 x80 x9cin excess of the maximum quantity and type applied for and licensed xe2 x80 x9d and xe2 x80 x9cexported australian obligated material which was not authorized under license conditions xe2 x80 x9d nprior to his 26 year tenure in the transportation industry xe2 x80 x93 20 of which have been with tli mr lambert was an arabic linguist for the navy for five years and a senior intel analyst for the department of defense dod for three years nlambert also speaks fluent arabic and farsi persian along with french and italian nthe indictment against lambert corroborates prior reporting by the hill that an fbi mole buried deep within the russian nuclear industry had gathered extensive evidence of a scheme involving bribes and kickbacks between russian nuclear officials and tli xe2 x80 x93 which would have transported the us uranium sold to russia in the xe2 x80 x9920 percent xe2 x80 x99 uranium one deal n xe2 x80 x9cthe russians were compromising american contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats all of which raised legitimate national security concerns nand none of that evidence got aired before the obama administration made those decisions xe2 x80 x9d a person who worked on the case told the hill speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by us or russian officials xe2 x80 x9d nbased on what the fbi knew xe2 x80 x93 including evidence which purportedly includes a video of russians preparing briefcases of bribe money xe2 x80 x93 the uranium one deal never should have gone through nmoreover both robert mueller and current deputy attorney general rod rosenstein were directly involved xe2 x80 x93 and current attorney general jeff sessions and other justice department officials appear to be covering for them nin short the fbi had ample evidence of the russian bribery plot before the obama administration approved the uranium one deal thanks to their embedded mole in the russian nuclear industry nthe informant xe2 x80 x93 outed as energy consultant william campbell xe2 x80 x93 was xe2 x80 x9cthreatened xe2 x80 x9d by obama admin ag loretta lynch to keep quiet with an ironclad gag order according to his attorney xe2 x80 x93 former reagan justice dept nofficial and former chief counsel to the senate intelligence committee victoria toensing nafter senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley rva demanded campbell be allowed to testify in front of congress the gag order was lifted nattorney general jeff sessions originally tried to claim that there was no connection between uranium one and the nuclear transport bribery case however several congressional republicans pushed back n xe2 x80 x9cattorney general sessions seemed to say that the bribery racketeering and money laundering offenses involving tenex xe2 x80 x99s vadim mikerin occurred after the approval of the uranium one deal by the obama administration nbut we know that the fbi xe2 x80 x99s confidential informant was actively compiling incriminating evidence as far back as 2009 xe2 x80 x9d rep ron desantis rfla told the hill n xe2 x80 x9cit is hard to fathom how such a transaction could have been approved without the existence of the underlying corruption being disclosed ni hope ag sessions gets briefed about the ci and gives the uranium one case the scrutiny it deserves xe2 x80 x9d added desantis whose house oversight and government reform subcommittees is one of the investigating panels nsenate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley riowa sent a similar rebuke last week to rosenstein saying the deputy attorney general xe2 x80 x99s first response to the committee xe2 x80 x9clargely missed the point xe2 x80 x9d of the congressional investigations n xe2 x80 x9cthe essential question is whether the obama justice department provided notice of the criminal activity of certain officials before the cfius approval of the uranium one deal and other government decisions that enabled the russians to trade nuclear materials in the us xe2 x80 x9d grassley scolded xe2 x80 x9d nmeanwhile journalists john solomon and journalist sara carter claim to have copies of the fbi informant xe2 x80 x99s evidence while carter issued an explosive report in late november laying out the players the timeline and the evidence at hand n xe2 x80 x9cby the time the sale of uranium one was approved by the obama administration the fbi xe2 x80 x99s investigators had already gathered substantial evidence and the bureau was also aware of russia xe2 x80 x99s intentions to enter the us energy market and its desire to purchase a stake in american uranium xe2 x80 x9d carter writes nhighlights nfbi mole william campbell was a highly valued fbi asset xe2 x80 x93 paid 51000 by fbi officials at a celebration dinner in chrystal city va where campbell xe2 x80 x99s attorney says they thanked him for his service ncampbell was required by the russians under threat to launder large sums of money xe2 x80 x93 which allowed the fbi to uncover a massive russian xe2 x80 x9cnuclear money laundering apparatus xe2 x80 x9d ncampbell collected over 5000 documents and briefs over a six year period ncampbell uncovered a russian plot to penetrate the obama administration and gain approval for the uranium one sale including a 2010 email which describes xe2 x80 x9crussia xe2 x80 x99s intent on expanding its uranium expansion in the united states xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cthis is not just about bribery and kickbacks but about a us company that was transporting yellowcake for the russians with our approval xe2 x80 x9d an unnamed us intelligence official told carter adding xe2 x80 x9cthis should raise serious questions nat the time everyone was concerned about russia xe2 x80 x99s ties to iran we still are nand of course russia xe2 x80 x99s intentions and reach into the us

islamic converts to catholicism who want francis to answer a simple question why did they literally risk their lives to become catholic if islam is xe2 x80 x9ca good religion in itself xe2 x80 x9d as the pope xe2 x80 x9cseems to teach xe2 x80 x9d nit xe2 x80 x99s a question he refuses to answer despite endless platitudes of how important it is to be close to the marginalized and to accompany those on the peripheries of the church nthe signers however are not dissuaded in their pursuit of a paternal answer nyou do not like to beat around the bush and neither do we so allow us to say frankly that we do not understand your teaching about islam as we read in paragraphs 252 and 253 of evangelii gaudium because it does not account for the fact that islam came after christ and so is and can only be an antichrist see 1 jn 222 and one of the most dangerous because it presents itself as the fulfillment of revelation of which jesus would have been only a prophet nif islam is a good religion in itself as you seem to teach why did we become catholic ndo not your words question the soundness of the choice we made at the risk of our lives nislam prescribes death for apostates quran 489 8711 do

105,special report pope francis accused of inaction in notorious sex abuse cases n nthe incident was brief on the thursday of the pope xe2 x80 x99s weeklong south american trip in response to an impromptu question tossed out by a chilean reporter the pope responded in what one reporter described as a xe2 x80 x9csnippy tone xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cthe day i see proof against bishop barros then i will talk nthere is not a single piece of evidence against him nit is all calumny nis that clear xe2 x80 x9d nthis month has been quite a spectacle even for this pontificate an apparently unending stream of outrages and embarrassments with the pope and his vatican media support jumping from one scandal to the next nbut among secular reporters the sex abuse issue trumps all others and the fallout continues to blaze down on the bergoglian pontificate in response to his amazing accusation earlier this month that victims of sexual abuse by clergy were engaging in xe2 x80 x9ccalumny xe2 x80 x9d in their accusations against a chilean bishop juan de la cruz barros madrid nit seems the shine is coming off the papal penny among leftist secular journalists his natural constituency nwriting for the boston globe the paper that first broke the clerical sex abuse scandals all the way back in 2001 kevin cullen wrote xe2 x80 x9clet the record show that the promise of pope francis died in santiago chile on jan 18 in the year of our lord 2018 xe2 x80 xa6 he has revealed himself like no one else could xe2 x80 x9d nbut it gets worse than this nwhen a xe2 x80 x9cleftist xe2 x80 x9d pope pressing a secularist agenda on the church starts to lose the support of michael sean winters and the national catholic reporter he must know he xe2 x80 x99s in trouble nthough he xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9csticking with francis xe2 x80 x9d for now winters wrote xe2 x80 x9ci wish i knew what it was about pope francis that makes him fail to grasp the situation with bishop barros the pain caused to the victims and the damage done to the church ni am gobsmacked that the pope twice declined to accept the bishop xe2 x80 x99s resignation xe2 x80 x9d non january 23rd an unsigned ncr editorial opined xe2 x80 x9cwithin the space of four days pope francis twice slandered abuse survivors xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cthese remarks are at the least shameful nat the most they suggest that francis now could be complicit in the coverup nthe script is all too familiar discredit the survivors xe2 x80 x99 testimony support the prelate in question and bank on public attention moving on to something else n xe2 x80 x9cthe insistence with which francis defends barros is mystifying nthree separate journalists on the papal flight gave the pope opportunity to say why exactly he believed the bishop instead of the survivors accusing him nthe second journalist to ask francis about barros on the flight was a chilean woman nas she spoke to the pope her voice cracked with nervousness at questioning the church xe2 x80 x99s top leader nshe asked xe2 x80 x98why are not the victims xe2 x80 x99 testimonies proof for you nwhy do you not believe them xe2 x80 x99 the pope gave no satisfying answer only repeating a claim of xe2 x80 x98no evidence xe2 x80 x99 against the bishop xe2 x80 x9d nindeed it was understood as the washington post said that francis xe2 x80 x99 trip to latin america xe2 x80 x93 dogged by protests over barros both in person at the pope xe2 x80 x99s appearances and in the press xe2 x80 x93 was in part intended as xe2 x80 x9can apology tour xe2 x80 x9d to abuse survivors nwhich is why his accusation of calumny against those same victims the next day came as such a shock to observers unused to bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s ability to turn on a dime nall was going as planned non wednesday january 17 the pope met as scheduled with selected survivors of sexual abuse by priests nhe made all the right noises talking about his xe2 x80 x9cpain and shame xe2 x80 x9d and reportedly even crying at what happened n xe2 x80 x9ci know the pain of these cases of child abuse and i am following how much is needed to overcome this serious and painful evil xe2 x80 x9d he said n24 hours later he was calling them liars njames hamilton 49 and now a doctor was one of the barros accusers nhe told the bbc at a press conference xe2 x80 x9cwhat the pope has done today is offensive and painful and not only against us but against everyone seeking to end the abuses xe2 x80 x9d the lead voice of the victims in chile juan carlos cruz tweeting to one of francis xe2 x80 x99s leading apologists austen ivereigh said xe2 x80 x9cdoes he need a photo a selfie as proof nsorry austen we didn xe2 x80 x99t think of it as we were being abused and juan barros watching xe2 x80 x9d nalthough the issue came to the attention of a much broader audience during the most recent papal trip the outcry has been ongoing since his appointment to the southern chilean diocese of osorno in 2015 nbarros was a student prot xc3 xa9g xc3 xa9e of the charismatic homosexualpederast predator fernando karadima and went on to be ordained in 1984 made bishop in 1995 and appointed as bishop of the armed forces nbarros claimed in court that the first he knew of karadima xe2 x80 x99s offenses was on a chilean television programme in 2010 nthis is refuted by karadima xe2 x80 x99s victims xe2 x80 x93 deemed credible both by the secular courts and the vatican tribunal xe2 x80 x93 who testified that he personally witnessed the abuse at sacred heart of jesus church in santiago nlast thursday however was not the first time francis confronted unexpectedly in public over the barros question has responded testily and with insults nin 2015 the italian newspaper il fatto quotidiano published a video of him scolding two women who spoke with him in st peter xe2 x80 x99s piazza asking that he reconsider the appointment citing the xe2 x80 x9csuffering xe2 x80 x9d of the church in chile over the issue nthe pope told the women xe2 x80 x9cthe church has lost its freedom letting its head fill with politicians and accusing a bishop without having any proof after twenty years of service so think with your head xe2 x80 x9d he warned them not to allow themselves to be led by xe2 x80 x9cleftists who have set up this thing xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cthe only charge against this bishop has been discredited by the court of justice so please do not lose your serenity you suffer but because you are foolishi am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes but in this case there is not even a proof xe2 x80 x9d nthe insults were not forgotten namong the signs held by protesters in chile last week were those reading xe2 x80 x9cni zurdos ni tontos xe2 x80 x9d neither lefties nor stupid nthe jab certainly wasn xe2 x80 x99t lost on francis since the signs were being held by protesters the full length of his auto route to santiago from the airport none of the protesters told the bbc xe2 x80 x9che doesn xe2 x80 x99t even know us so how can he accuse us of being such things nhe thinks we are politically motivated even though we come from different parishes in osorno and are doing this because we are against priests being allowed to abuse children xe2 x80 x9d napparently his holiness was informed that the xe2 x80 x9ccalumny xe2 x80 x9d comment had caused some blowback because a couple of days later we got something touted xe2 x80 x93 though somewhat skeptically xe2 x80 x93 as a xe2 x80 x9ccontrite xe2 x80 x9d papal apology nthis also followed an astonishing public rebuke of the pope by sean cardinal o xe2 x80 x99malley xe2 x80 x93 a member of the c9 council of cardinals and the former head of the pope xe2 x80 x99s sex abuse commission xe2 x80 x93 who said xe2 x80 x9cit is understandable that pope francis xe2 x80 x99 statements yesterday in santiago chile were a source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse by clergy or any other perpetrator xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cpope francis fully recognizes the egregious failures of the church and its clergy who abused children and the devastating impact those crimes have had on survivors and their loved ones xe2 x80 x9d o xe2 x80 x99malley said nof course francis being francis the apology was banked around with assertions of how right he was n xe2 x80 x9ci have to ask forgiveness because the word xe2 x80 x98proof xe2 x80 x99 wounded xe2 x80 x9d he said n xe2 x80 x9cit wounded many people who were abused xe2 x80 xa6i ask them for forgiveness because i wounded them without realizing it but it was an unintended wound nand this horrified me a lot because i had received them xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cand i know how much they suffer to feel that the pope says in their face xe2 x80 x98bring me a letter a proof xe2 x80 x99 it xe2 x80 x99s a slap nand i agree that my expression was not apt because i didn xe2 x80 x99t think xe2 x80 x9d nhe doubled down saying xe2 x80 x9ci have not heard any victim of barros nthey did not come they did not show themselves they did not give evidence in court nit xe2 x80 x99s all in the air nit is true that barros was in karadima xe2 x80 x99s group of young people nbut let us be clear if you accuse someone without evidence with pertinacity that is calumny xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cthis is what i can say with sincerity nbarros will remain there if i don xe2 x80 x99t find a way to condemn him ni cannot condemn him if i don xe2 x80 x99t have xe2 x80 x93 i don xe2 x80 x99t say proof xe2 x80 x93 but evidence nand there are many ways to get evidence nis that clear xe2 x80 x9d nthis xe2 x80 x9ccontrite xe2 x80 x9d papal apology didn xe2 x80 x99t fly well even with the regular news reporters nphilip pullela a reporter on the plane for reuters described it as xe2 x80 x9can extremely rare act of selfcriticism xe2 x80 x9d for the xe2 x80 x9cunusually contrite xe2 x80 x9d bergoglio and noted that xe2 x80 x9cwhile the pope has vowed xe2 x80 x98zero tolerance xe2 x80 x99 for sexual abuse his efforts have sputtered xe2 x80 x9d nindeed francis claim that he met with and heard the xe2 x80 x9cpain xe2 x80 x9d of the victims is untrue in the specific case in hand ncbs news reports that though the osorno group had tried to obtain a meeting during the trip they were refused ngreg burke the pope xe2 x80 x99s press officer confirmed that xe2 x80 x9cno papal meetings were planned with the osorno group which had formally requested to meet with the pope in july but were told by vatican organizers that his schedule was already final some six months before the trip xe2 x80 x9d nwho is barros nsome may remember a video that made the internet rounds of an uproar in a chilean cathedral at the installation ceremony of a bishop nat the time it didn xe2 x80 x99t draw much attention from the english language press xe2 x80 x93 mostly at that time distracted by the ongoing battle of the notorious kasper proposal and the oncoming synods nbut despite the pope xe2 x80 x99s claim the charges against barros are serious and have been deemed credible by a judge nhe is accused of having covered up sexual abuse including destroying evidence committed by karadima in the xe2 x80 x9880s and xe2 x80 x9890s nin fact xe2 x80 x93 and this point has tended to get glossed over in the press xe2 x80 x93 barros is accused by the victims of having been in the room watching at the time and of engaging in sexual activity with karadima nthis is not therefore merely a matter of a bishop or colleague discovering the abuse after the fact but of being a voyeuristic participant njuan carlos cruz told the press in 2015 that he and another boy xe2 x80 x93 both in their teens at the time xe2 x80 x93 xe2 x80 x9cwould lie down on the priest xe2 x80 x99s karadima xe2 x80 x99s bed one resting his head at the man xe2 x80 x99s shoulder another sitting near his feet nthe priest would kiss the boys and grope them he said all while the rev njuan barros watched xe2 x80 x9d cruz now a 51yearold xe2 x80 x9cgay xe2 x80 x9d journalist told the associated press xe2 x80 x9cbarros was there and he saw it all xe2 x80 x9d na vatican investigation found karadima guilty in 2011 and sentenced him to a life of seclusion in a monastery for xe2 x80 x9cpenitence and prayer xe2 x80 x9d note that date 2011 was when the processes for investigating and trying priestabusers put in place by the former cardinal ratzinger were still in effect and while he was still sitting on the petrine throne nthings are a bit different now nneither was the complaint against barros without the support of responsible people nthe media reported that over 1300 catholic faithful in osorno including 30 priests of the diocese and 51 members of parliament wrote to the pope asking him to rescind the appointment xe2 x80 x93 none of which received any response nfr npeter kleigel a priest of osorno told associated press xe2 x80 x9cwe xe2 x80 x99re convinced that this appointment is not correct because following canon law a bishop must be wellregarded nwe need a bishop who xe2 x80 x99s credible xe2 x80 x9d nthe problem with getting the news out about karadima as in most of these cases was the bishop in this case cardinal francisco javier err xc3 xa1zuriz of santiago who after the conclave of 2013 was appointed a member of pope francis xe2 x80 x99s c9 inner council nit was certainly never a secret that err xc3 xa1zuriz was a close likeminded friend and collaborator of thencardinal bergoglio the kingpin of south american catholicism nallegations against karadima xe2 x80 x93 that went back to 1962 xe2 x80 x93 had certainly been reported to church authorities well before a chilean news agency revealed the case in 2010 but were ignored by err xc3 xa1zuriz neven the national catholic reporter in 2014 pointed to the cover up and the relationship between the new pope and the accused cardinals n xe2 x80 x9chamilton had applied for a marriage annulment after telling his wife of a long psychosexual entanglement with karadima that began when he was 17 in el bosque nhis wife confided in a priest who told err xc3 xa1zuriz in 2006 nwhen a canon lawyer and several priests close to the cardinal suggested that hamilton not mention karadima he pressed on with his request in order to force the issue of punishment for the priest while having his marriage annulled nagain err xc3 xa1zuriz refused to take action against karadima xe2 x80 x9d nthe pope xe2 x80 x99s claim that there is xe2 x80 x9cno evidence xe2 x80 x9d flies in the face of the ruling of the civil judge in the karadima case xe2 x80 x93 a fact that ought to be of paramount consideration under the vatican xe2 x80 x99s own rules for determining credibility in such cases nwhile judge jessica gonzalez was forced to drop criminal charges because the statute of limitations had expired she affirmed that testimony by cruz and other victims was credible nafter a full year of investigation gonzalez called their claims xe2 x80 x9ctruthful and reliable xe2 x80 x9d nvictims said that a letter written to church authorities complaining of karadima xe2 x80 x99s abuse in 1982 was intercepted and destroyed by barros who was serving at the time as secretary to cardinal francisco fresno err xc3 xa1zuriz xe2 x80 x99s successor and collaborator nas for barros xe2 x80 x99s general credibility as a catholic bishop the witness of the victims is damning nin a letter to bishop ivo scapolo papal nuncio to chile that cruz gave to the associated press he said he witnessed karadima and barros in an intimate relationship n xe2 x80 x9ci saw karadima and juan barros kissing and touching each other nthe groping generally came from karadima touching barros xe2 x80 x99 genitals xe2 x80 x9d nbarros has never denied having had a close friendship with karadima nhamilton confirmed this saying xe2 x80 x9ci saw how barros watched it all xe2 x80 x9d nand the matter didn xe2 x80 x99t end in 2010 nemails published in chile in 2015 showed that cardinal err xc3 xa1zuriz also blocked the appointment of juan carlos cruz from the new child protection commission xe2 x80 x93 a group plagued by such scandals and eventually ignored to death by francis nwhich brings us to francis bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s own record in this area nthe pope claimed xe2 x80 x9ci am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes xe2 x80 x9d but this claim is not supported by the reality nindeed it has been pointed out that francis has gone to considerable lengths to dismantle the efforts of his predecessor at xe2 x80 x9csafeguarding xe2 x80 x9d young people punishing abusers and removing bishops who cover it up nin the case of barros the associated press obtained a confidential letter from pope francis dated 2015 that xe2 x80 x9creveals the chilean bishops xe2 x80 x99 concern about francis naming a karadima prot xc3 xa9g xc3 xa9 bishop juan barros xe2 x80 x9d just days before the pope xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9ccalumny xe2 x80 x9d comment january 11 ap reported that francis had full knowledge of the controversy he risked in appointing barros to osorno n xe2 x80 x9chis ambassador in chile had tried to find a way to contain the damage well before the case made headlines xe2 x80 x9d nthe letter addressed to the executive committee of the chilean bishops xe2 x80 x99 conference said xe2 x80 x9cthank you for having openly demonstrated the concern that you have about the appointment of monsignor juan barros ni understand what you xe2 x80 x99re telling me and i xe2 x80 x99m aware that the situation of the church in chile is difficult due to the trials you xe2 x80 x99ve had to undergo xe2 x80 x9d the letter said that in 2014 the nuncio archbishop scapolo had asked barros to resign as bishop of the armed forces and had xe2 x80 x9cencouraged him to take a sabbatical year before assuming any other pastoral responsibility as a bishop xe2 x80 x9d nthere can also be little doubt the new pope was fully aware of the record of his close friend cardinal err xc3 xa1zuriz in ignoring complaints of karadima xe2 x80 x99s victims when he appointed him to the c9 council nand even if he didn xe2 x80 x99t then he certainly knows now and yet errazuriz continues in that advisory role nfrancis further appointed cardinal err xc3 xa1zuriz to serve as his special envoy to world apostolic congress of mercy iii meeting in bogot xc3 xa1 colombia in june 2014 nsince 2001 cardinal ratzinger and later as pope benedict installed effective procedural reforms on clerical sexual abuse francis in his short five years has all but completely dismantled or reversed those changes namong the earliest indications catholics had that the new pope had no intention of getting to the bottom of the priestabuser problem was his appointment of the notorious homosexual monsignor battista ricca as head of the vatican bank and the man in charge of his own residence the casa santa martha nit is often forgotten that bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s notorious comment xe2 x80 x9cwho am i to judge xe2 x80 x9d was in response to a question on a planepresser about ricca and was followed with a similar claim from francis about there having been no proof of his misbehaviour nas the pseudonymous marcantonio colonna wrote in the book xe2 x80 x9cthe dictator pope xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cin fact his patronage of monsignor ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was archbishop of buenos aires whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb xe2 x80 x9d nbut even before this was the sinister appearance of godfried cardinal danneels on the loggia on the night of francis xe2 x80 x99s election to the papacy ndanneels xe2 x80 x99s prominence in the bergoglian pontificate continues to be the most prominent indicator of the pope xe2 x80 x99s deprioritising of clerical sexual abuse nthe former head of the brussels archdiocese was a leading figure in the socalled st gallen group which he himself described as a xe2 x80 x9cmafia xe2 x80 x9d who had worked against the election of joseph ratzinger in 2005 and to elect bergoglio in 2013 nat the end of a long career as europe xe2 x80 x99s leading xe2 x80 x9cliberal xe2 x80 x9d catholic prelate danneels came under a cloud of scandal when he was accused of having covered for a prot xc3 xa9g xc3 xa9 bishop who admitted to having sexually abused his own minor nephew nin 2010 the publication of an audio recording determined undeniably that danneels had told the victim to keep quiet and not cause trouble for the soontoretire bishop roger vangheluwe of bruges nthe cardinal even went so far as to suggest that the victim should xe2 x80 x9cask forgiveness xe2 x80 x9d for his own role in the scandal nbefore the recordings were released danneels had also denied all knowledge of sexual abuse by clergy or coverups nin the book colonna asks the question xe2 x80 x9cwhat happened to xe2 x80 x98zero tolerance xe2 x80 x99 for clerical sexual offenders xe2 x80 x9d he wrote that data presented by the vatican the un human rights commission in january 2014 showed that benedict xvi xe2 x80 x9chad defrocked or suspended more than 800 priests for past sexual abuse between 2009 and 2012 xe2 x80 x9d including the notorious fr nmaciel degollado founder of the legionaries of christ ncrucially it was ratzinger who moved the competence for sex abuse cases from the congregation for bishops to doctrine of the faith with powers to suspend and punish offenders nhis reforms specifically included bishops who had refused to act against priestabusers na senior member of the vatican xe2 x80 x99s diplomatic corps archbishop miguel maury buendia confirmed this saying xe2 x80 x9cthis pope has removed two or three bishops per month throughout the world nthere have been two or three instances in which they said no and so the pope simply removed them xe2 x80 x9d nthese reforms xe2 x80 x93 and removals xe2 x80 x93 have ceased entirely under francis ndespite his claims that he punishes the guilty it was in fact francis who reversed the previous benedictera sentence against the notorious italian priestpederast mario inzoli at the request of the nowequally notorious cardinal coccopalmerio ninzoli was found guilty in 2012 by an ecclesiastical court of abusing boys as young as twelve and suspended ninzoli had even abused boys in the confessional convincing them that the abuse was approved by god nfollowing an appeal by coccopalmerio francis reduced the priest xe2 x80 x99s penalty to a xe2 x80 x9clifetime of prayer xe2 x80 x9d with permission to say mass privately and a promise to stay away from children nthe uproar over this caused the italian prosecutors to reopen the case against the priest and eventually inzoli went to prison and was laicized nas for ratzingerbenedict xe2 x80 x99s procedural reforms rumours continue to circulate that the pope intends to reverse them as well placing competence back into the hands of the same dicastery that held it when the scandals broke in 2001 nthis has been denied by greg burke but given francis xe2 x80 x99s usual methods it xe2 x80 x99s anyone xe2 x80 x99s guess who in reality is actually dealing with these cases if anyone na tribunal of bishops requested by his own sex abuse commission was ignored and then francis summarily removed two of the cdf staffers in charge of handling such cases famously refusing to give any reasons to cdf prefect cardinal m xc3 xbcller who was soon to be dismissed nin fact the chaos and lack of commitment on the issue has come under harsh criticism from at least one member of the pope xe2 x80 x99s nowdefunct sex abuse commission a loudly trumpeted part of bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s early scheme of reform nmarie collins an irish abuse survivor was appointed in 2014 to the new pontifical commission for the protection of minors nshe resigned in 2017 citing xe2 x80 x9cvatican officials xe2 x80 x99 reluctance to cooperate with its work to protect children xe2 x80 x9d collins released a damning statement indicating that the commission had never seriously intended to change or reform anything nshe said none of the commission xe2 x80 x99s recommendations had been implemented n xe2 x80 x9cthe reluctance of some in the vatican curia to implement recommendations or cooperate with the work of a commission when the purpose is to improve the safety of children and vulnerable adults around the world is unacceptable xe2 x80 x9d collins wrote nas of december last year the commission has been allowed to lapse and no longer functions though it has not been definitively dissolved nthe terms of office of its members expired december 17th nthis week collins tweeted her question for pope francis on the chilean situation xe2 x80 x9cwhy does the pope not believe these three men nthey have been consistent over years in what they say nwhen asked why he believes his fellow cleric and not

massimo faggioli discussed pope francis xe2 x80 x99s legacy and its effect on internal church controversies non wednesday night new york times columnist ross douthat and villanova professor of theology massimo faggioli came together for a debate entitled xe2 x80 x9cfrancis  five assessing the legacy of pope francis five years after his election xe2 x80 x9d as i made my way up to fordham university i was excited nhaving followed douthat and faggioli xe2 x80 x99s ongoing dialogue on twitter i knew i was in for a lively if predictable conversation nin his opening remarks douthat laid out three criteria that can be used to evaluate francis xe2 x80 x99s papacy thus far his impact on the public xe2 x80 x99s perception of the church a success his attempts at reforming the vatican bureaucracy a disappointment and his position on xe2 x80 x9cmoraltheological controversies xe2 x80 x9d specifically communion for the divorced and remarried a problem nadvertisement nadvertisement nfaggioli meanwhile outlined a genuinely surprising position nrather than making a straightforward case for why pope francis has changed the church for the better faggioli rejected the possibility of evaluating his papacy in terms of xe2 x80 x9ccontinuity xe2 x80 x9d with past popes since doing so would assume that xe2 x80 x9cchristianity at some point  n n nwas complete xe2 x80 x9d which faggioli does not think is true nwhile i emphatically disagree with this argument i have to hand it to faggioli from the outset he made clear that he was not planning to debate douthat on the implications of the francis papacy ninstead through a combination of rhetorical tricks and softpeddled hegelianism he would completely redefine the role and nature of the catholic church nduring the crux of the debate xe2 x80 x94 the discussion of communion for the divorced and remarried xe2 x80 x94 faggioli raised his most theologically unsettling point nto defend his position that remarried persons should be able to receive communion faggioli invoked the case of germany where 50 percent of catholic marriages end in divorce nfor faggioli the implication is that at least 50 percent of german catholic children never see their parents receive communion and lose their faith because of it nthis he says is xe2 x80 x9cbad for evangelization xe2 x80 x9d and in order to keep the pews full the church xe2 x80 x99s role should not be to deny communion to the divorced and remarried but instead to ask xe2 x80 x9cwhat can the catholic church do to make the faithful able to receive sacraments xe2 x80 x9d nadvertisement nthis is a lovely suggestion and one that i xe2 x80 x99m not entirely unsympathetic to nhowever the fact remains that faggioli is suggesting the church do much more than provide sacraments to the faithful njust before invoking the german case faggioli characterized the country as one of the most secular in the world nbut rather than lamenting what secularism has wrought on marital life in germany reasserting the church xe2 x80 x99s position on marriage and insisting that the faithful strive to live according to her laws faggioli argues that the church ought to bend to the will of secular society nadvertisement nit should be clear to anyone not just practicing catholics that this is absurd nif the church exists simply to accommodate the whims and failures of secular modernity then what is the point of the church npope benedict xvi has warned against precisely the kind of xe2 x80 x9caccommodation xe2 x80 x9d faggioli is calling for writing that when xe2 x80 x9cthe people cannot cope xe2 x80 x9d with god they xe2 x80 x9cbring him down into their own world xe2 x80 x9d and insist that xe2 x80 x9che must be the kind of god that they need xe2 x80 x9d in other words xe2 x80 x9cman is using god and in reality even if it is not outwardly discernible he is placing himself above god xe2 x80 x9d to fully drive the point home benedict equates this kind of worship with the israelites desert worship of the bull calf nunsurprisingly this progressive interpretation of catholic doctrine eventually reveals itself to be rank historicism nthroughout the debate faggioli drew out the argument that allowing the remarried to receive communion would not represent a radical change in doctrine but a return to the teachings of the gospel neventually douthat drew his argument to its logical conclusion with this question were priests throughout history in fact misleading their divorced and remarried parishioners by telling them they could not receive communion nafter a few seconds xe2 x80 x99 pause faggioli gave the only answer he could xe2 x80 x9cthere are different responses to the same question in different times xe2 x80 x9d nadvertisement nthroughout their conversation both douthat and faggioli repeatedly observed that the debate over pope francis and the future of the church is carried on primarily among catholic intellectuals unbeknownst to most of xe2 x80 x9cthe flock xe2 x80 x9d nadvertisement nit strikes me however that everybody xe2 x80 x94 catholic or not xe2 x80 x94 has a dog in this fight which is about more than communion and canon law nat its core this debate is about truth and our ability to judge right from wrong ncould we possibly say for instance that it xe2 x80 x99s impossible to judge the presidency of donald trump relative to past presidents nof course not xe2 x80 x94 that would be preposterous as i xe2 x80 x99m sure faggioli would agree nto pass moral judgements on papacies presidencies or anything else we must have recourse to truth and to the institutions that have upheld this truth for centuries nwhether in the church or in the academy we must resist this dangerous historicist impulse nif we don xe2 x80 x99t we will find ourselves in the words of pope benedict in xe2 x80 x9ca dictatorship of relativism that does not recognize anything as definitive and whose ultimate goal consists solely of one xe2 x80 x99s own ego and desires xe2 x80 x9d nadvertisement nread more na defense of the catholic tradition nthe left xe2 x80 x99s new plan to gut religiousliberty protections nwhat xe2 x80 x99s at

doing nothing nthe pope caused outrage after a visit to chile last month by defending bishop barros who was made a bishop in 2015 nthe vatican refused to comment on the letter when approached by bbc

of his letter written in spanish to bbc news showing it was addressed personally to pope francis and dated 3 march 2015 nthat was more than two weeks before the bishop  ordination in the south chilean city of osorno an event dramatically disrupted by hundreds of protesters accusing bishop barros of covering up karadima  sex attacks on young boys nthe bishop has denied ever knowing about the serious abuses committed by karadima who was never prosecuted in chile because so much time had passed but was convicted and sentenced by the vatican to a lifetime of penance and prayer nholy father i decided to write this letter to you because i m tired of fighting crying and suffering mr cruz writes n xc2 xa9 afp cardinal o malley centre accompanied the pope in latin america nour story is well known and there  no point reminding you of it except to tell you of the horror of having experienced this abuse and how i wanted to kill myself nin his letter he also attaches the full text of a previous letter written a month earlier to the vatican  top diplomat in chile archbishop ivo scapolo nin that letter mr cruz accuses bishop barros of doing all the dirty work of fernando karadima and describes the abuse he suffered and which bishop barros allegedly witnessed nwhen we were in a room with karadima and juan barros if he barros wasn t kissing karadima he watched as one of us the youngest was touched by karadima and forced to give him kisses he writes nkaradima would say to me put your mouth next to mine and stick out your tongue  nhe d stick out his and kiss us with his tongue njuan barros witnessed all of this on countless occasions not just in my case but in the case of others as well naddressing himself to pope francis mr cruz says holy father juan barros says he saw nothing and yet there are dozens of us who can testify to the fact that not only was he present when karadima abused us but that he too kissed karadima and they touched each other nhe concludes the letter with this appeal please holy father don t be like the others nthere are so many of us who despite everything think that you can do something ni treasure my faith it  what sustains me but it is slipping away from me nhasn t the pope already apologised n xc2 xa9 afp karadima was only punished by the vatican nthe remarks that the pope had made in january that caused such offence were the day

feelings without meaning to but continued to insist there was no evidence against the bishop nin barros  case it was studied he said nit was restudied nand there is no evidence ni don t have evidence to convict nhow far did the letter get n xc2 xa9 reuters bishop barros centre was greeted by angry protesters at his ordination nmembers of the pope  own commission for the protection of minors set up

124,for the first time online archbishop lefebvre xe2 x80 x99s prophetic address to the remnant 1976 n non that occasion archbishop lefebvre delivered an address on the desperate state of the church at that time xe2 x80 x9442 years ago xe2 x80 x94that was never transcribed or published until we did so for the december 15 2017 print edition of the remnant nit was held at the radisson south hotel minneapolis on tuesday may 12 1976 and its stated purpose was to assist the archbishop in gaining a stronger foothold for the society of st pius x in the states during the unprecedented crisis blessed pope paul had helped unleash on the church ni xe2 x80 x99m posting the address here because im convinced the archbishop xe2 x80 x99s words provide recent recruits to tradition with vital historical context for the diabolical debacle that is the pontificate of pope francis nand for those of us who xe2 x80 x99ve been in the trenches for a long long time it also provides welcome reminder of why we must continue to fight neven though i personally was in attendance back in 1976 when archbishop lefebvre delivered this address in minneapolis i was only ten years old and of course didnt realize how prophetic he was on that occasion or how devastated by the second vatican council the new mass and the freemasonic infiltration of the vatican nin fact this transcript reads like a message of encouragement at a crucial moment in the history of this movement xe2 x80 x94stay in the fight nkeep the faith nnever surrender nthis address also makes it absolutely clear that everything archbishop lefebvre did was part of an eleventhhour defence of the kingship of christ ignored completely by the second vatican council and a desperate last stand for tradition the infallible teachings of mother church and of course her ancient liturgy nand now that pope francis has inadvertently unmasked the true spirit of vatican ii it becomes obvious how and why those who resisted that spirit were right to have done so and will certainly be hailed by history as the heroic band of catholic brothers that mounted the twentieth century xe2 x80 x99s last stand for christ the king and while scorned and mocked at the time were nevertheless totally vindicated fifty years later nmay we continue to earn the right to stand with them today nmjm nthe archbishop speaks nladies and gentlemen nas i said to mr walter matt i can say in bad english what he says in good english because he said all of the things i want to say referring here to walter matt xe2 x80 x99s introductory talk referenced above nand i thank you mr matt very much for his invitation and i thank you for your coming and i thank fr nward for what he said about the society of st pius x nand i hope that you can understand my poor english but i think it is better to speak some bad english because to translate would take too much time nas mr matt said the crisis in the church is very extraordinary nit is very difficult to understand the situation today nmy seminary in econe in switzerland and the seminaries in germany and here in america in armada are in very difficult situations with rome nwhy nthese seminaries are the same as seminaries were before the second vatican council nthey have the same discipline and the same studies they make good priests i think they are good seminarians nall is done as all the seminaries before the second vatican council nwhy are we now in this very sad situation with rome ni think that because in the second vatican council and after the council there is a mutation a change in the church nbut we do not change nwe continue the tradition nso why do they now say as mgr narchbishop benelli1 said to me months ago on the 19th of march xe2 x80 x9cyou are out of communion with the church xe2 x80 x9d i am out of communion with the church because i continue the tradition of the church nthis is possible ni do not understand nwhy ni have done nothing ni believe nothing other than what the church has believed for twenty centuries nmgr nbenelli then said to me you must put down in a writing to the holy father that you accept the second vatican council you accept the reform that followed the council and that you accept the orientations that have been given by rome nmgr nbenelli took the book of the new ordo gave it to me and said xe2 x80 x9cyou must say this new mass in all of your houses xe2 x80 x9d ni wonder why mgr nbenelli did not communicate this condition to me before our meeting n2 he could have done so nfor example one year ago three cardinals sent me a letter cardinals wright tabera arturo carinal tabera araoz one of the council fathers mjm and gabrielmarie garrone telling me in effect that i must close the seminaries nwell i refused because i refuse to contribute to the destruction of the church nbecause now they are destroying the church nwhen i die and go before the judge god will not be able to say to me xe2 x80 x9cyou destroyed the church xe2 x80 x9d i refused to contribute to the destruction of the church ni am sure that my seminaries are contributing to the restoration of the church ni do not destroy the church nand so i said to mgr nbenelli xe2 x80 x9cno i will not sign that writing xe2 x80 x9d ni think that the mutation in the church came in through the second vatican council nand do you think this change in the church came suddenly nwhen then nat the beginning of the council nno this change in the church began one century before the council npope pius vi said during the french revolution that if the church continues to remain under the influence of the prince of the revolution then in the future a crisis will come upon the church nin 1844 pope pius ix ordered cardinal rigoli to publish the instructions of the carbonari n3 the pope himself asked cardinal rigoli to publish the instructions of the carbonari nand what did these instructions say nthe instructions said that they the carbonarifreemasons must begin to fight against the church by bringing reform into the church nthe instructions said the infiltration will take perhaps not one year perhaps not ten years but perhaps a century nthe carbonari must enter into the seminary into the convent into the sacristy and slowly very slowly the priests will have the ideals of the revolution of the freemasons none day these priests imbued with masonic principles will become bishops and these bishops can then choose a pope nand even if the pope is not a freemason he will have the same ideals as the freemasons npope pius ix called for the publishing of these instructions in order to warn the bishops and priests of those times of the fight against the church nin 1895 the catholic antonia fogazzaro a known modernist founded a masonic lodge in milan nhe wrote in his book il santo that xe2 x80 x9cwe modernists xe2 x80 xa6want a reform in the church xe2 x80 xa6without rebellion carried out by legitimate authority xe2 x80 xa6even if this takes 20 30 or 50 years xe2 x80 x9d4 xe2 x80 x9cthe reform will have to be brought about in the name of obedience xe2 x80 x9d the modernist ideas in the church introduced and enacted through obedience nand i think xe2 x80 xa6well here we are nin this time nthe reform is here and it is brought about through obedience to the council to the bishop to the priest nand all they say is xe2 x80 x9cobedience obedience obedience xe2 x80 x9d nthe instructions of the carbonari say the bishop and the priest will think that they are following the tiara of the pope but they will be following the flag of freemasonry  xe2 x80 x9cthe banner of revolution xe2 x80 x9d nthey said that nthey wrote that none century before the council nthus it is very important to know that they prepared for the beginning of the second vatican council for a century perhaps two centuries nas the archbishop of dakar and president of the episcopal commission for frenchspeaking west africa i was appointed member of the central preparatory commission of the second vatican council nthere were some seventy cardinals twenty bishops and four superauthorities of the religious orders among others nbefore the last meeting of this commission the members received two schemas on the same subject one from cardinal ottaviani and another from cardinal bea nthe schema from cardinal ottaviani was titled xe2 x80 x9c xe2 x80 xa6on religious tolerance xe2 x80 x9d and the other from cardinal bea was titled xe2 x80 x9con religious freedom liberty xe2 x80 x9d when we read these two schemas we thought xe2 x80 x9cthis is impossible nhow is it we can receive two opposing theses none says we must not tolerate error nthe other says that error has the right to exist in the name of the dignity of the human person xe2 x80 x9d and so we go into the meeting ncardinal ottaviani standing says to cardinal bea xe2 x80 x9cyou have no authority to compose this schema because it is a theological thesis and therefore within the competence of the theological commission xe2 x80 x9d as cardinal bea stands up he says xe2 x80 x9ci do have the right to compose this schema because if anything concerns christian unity it is religious liberty and i am the president of the secretariat for promoting christian unity xe2 x80 x9d cardinal bea addressing cardinal ottaviani further said xe2 x80 x9ci am opposed to your schema xe2 x80 x9d nimpossible nwe were in a very sad serious situation ncardinal ruffini had to intervene as we were in front of two cardinals our brothers nhe said we must wait for the authority to say who is right and who is wrong nbut before the pope came because the pope came many times to present at these meetings we voted on the schema nwho is with cardinal ottaviani nwho is with cardinal bea nthe conservatives and the liberals nas the last meeting of the preparatory commission it was for me the first image of the future council nthis historic address appeared for the first time ever in a print edition of the remnant last year nisnt it time for you to subscribe nand as we go into the council you know that on the first day of the council cardinal lienart was the chief of the liberal cardinals in the council together with all of the cardinals of the rhine such as cardinal alfrink cardinal frings cardinal dopfner cardinal suenens cardinal leinart and cardinal koenig of austria nand now one month ago in rome the traditional periodical chiesa viva published a photo of cardinal lienart with all of the appurtenances of freemasonry the date of his inscription in masonry the date of his rising to the 20th degree of freemasonry the date of his rising to the 30th degree of freemasonry and the places where he attended the meetings of freemasonry nthis cardinal was the chief of the liberals in the council nthat is my cardinal he ordained me to the priesthood and he consecrated me a bishop nand now this is public nnobody has been able to refute the publication nand so we have i am confident a mutation in the church by the council and by the reform after the council nnow some say the council is was good but only the reforms were bad nthat is not true nwhy nbecause when the reforms come rome always says the reforms are being done in the name of the council nin the name of the council nit is evident that all of the reforms came from the council nand if the reforms are bad then it is impossible that the council is good and all the reforms are bad because that is the authentic interpretation of the council by rome nrome said in the name of the declaration of liturgy we implement the liturgical reform nwe can say that these bad changes are not in the text of the declaration but this man has the authority to say that this is from the council nthey know that nand i am sure that it the mutation is in the council neven if it is not explicitly stated in the council but rather in the spirit of the council it is the same nfor example with religious freedom now the holy see and all the nuncios are against the catholic state in the name of the council  in the name of the declaration of religious freedom ni have heard this personally twice nthe first time i was in columbia nwhen i was in columbia i read in the paper about the change in the first article of the constitution of the republic of columbia nthe first article stated that only the republic of columbia recognizes only the catholic religion nthey changed it nthey removed this article ni read the discourse of the president of columbia with the nuncios of columbia and the secretary of the episcopal conference in columbia nthe president said he is very very anxious nhe said to the people xe2 x80 x9ceven though we remove this article we remain catholic ni am a catholic i shall remain catholic and i do everything possible for the council and the catholics in our country xe2 x80 x9d nthen the discourse of the nuncio was the discourse of a freemason all of it was xe2 x80 x9cprogress xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9chumanity xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cevolution xe2 x80 x9d and all the hubris of a freemason nand during the discourse of the secretary of the episcopal conference the secretary said xe2 x80 x9cin the name of the declaration of religious freedom of vatican ii we ask the president to remove this article in the constitution xe2 x80 x9d ni met this secretary of the episcopal conference during my visit in columbia and he said for two years they had been asking the president in the name of the holy see to change this article in their constitution nbut i will never xe2 x80 xa6i do not accept the concept because you destroy the catholic state in the name of the council nare you sure nyes sure nit is evident nnow i said to the secretary xe2 x80 x9cas i speak with you now about columbia i know that you are the one responsible for the change in the constitution of valais in switzerland one year ago nthe change in the constitution of valais was the same xe2 x80 x9d because you know switzerland is a federation where some states are protestant and some states are catholic nthe valais is catholic nand in its constitution the words of the first article of the constitution of the state of valais xe2 x80 x93 econe where we are located is in the state of valais  only one religion is recognized the catholic church nand the secretary said xe2 x80 x9cyes i am responsible for this change xe2 x80 x9d brother what did you do with the social kingship of christ nwhat is this for you nwhat do you say when you say xe2 x80 x9cthy kingdom come xe2 x80 x9d in your prayer the our father n xe2 x80 x9cah xe2 x80 x9d the nuncio said to me xe2 x80 x9cnow it is impossible xe2 x80 x9d what did you do with the encyclical of pope pius xi quas primas n xe2 x80 x9cah but now the pope cannot write an encyclical like quas primas xe2 x80 x9d nit is incredible nand all in the name of the council nwe must take care because this change in the church is a liberal change nthe liberal principles have entered the church now and they destroy the church nif we cannot set out the true principles of the church if we in the name of religious freedom said that all religions have the same right in every state in the world xe2 x80 xa6 nmissing audio nthe truth is the only one king of the world is jesus christ nwe say in the gloria in excelsis deo xe2 x80 x9ctu solus altissimus xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9ctu solus dominus xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cyou alone are the highest xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cyou alone are the lord xe2 x80 x9d but practically we would refuse this kingdom of jesus christ if we said that luther mohammed buddha and jesus christ are all the same nwe cannot say that nimpossible nwe know that in many states it is a pity it is impossible to recognize catholicism as the state religion nwe must tolerate  have tolerance for the error  but never give the same right to error and truth nthat is impossible nand the change in the liturgy is very important nit is very bad none of the principles of modern man as they say now xe2 x80 x9cmodern man xe2 x80 x9d is democracy nand democracy can have a good sense but not if by that term is meant that those who govern receive their authority from the people nthe authority comes from god nnot from the people nnot from the masses nfrom god nbut today the principle the democratic principle is that the authority is in the people nit is in the masses nthat is not true nit is impossible nand our liturgy is the school of our faith nit is the first school of our faith for all people ni was in africa as a missionary and as bishop for 30 years ni know the liturgy was the best school of the faith for people who cannot read nthey can see what the priest does nthey can see what the priest does at the adoration of the body and the blood of jesus christ nand they know that jesus christ is present  his real presence is on the altar  by the attitude of the priest nthey know that nthat is very important nbut the change in the mass destroys the church nbecause we know the liturgy teaches us hierarchy nthe true liturgy is hierarchical nit is not democratic but hierarchical nwhy nbecause we have god the priest and then the people nthat is hierarchy nwhen we are in church we know god is on the altar the priest is between god and the people and the people receive god at the hand of the priest nthat is hierarchy nbut now the new liturgy is more democratic  all around the table nthe priest is only the president and sometimes another man can take the role of the president of the meal nthat is a new liturgy nthat is very bad because we have no sense of the hierarchical whereas the sense of hierarchy is very important in our life nwe need the authority of god nwe need the real presence of god on our altar nwe need the sacrifice of the mass xe2 x80 x93 not a meal only xe2 x80 x93 but the sacrifice nso the victim of the sacrifice is really present on our altar nthat is the school of our faith nand slowly slowly this new mass equivocates nit moves the minds of the faithful in a protestant direction ni do not say that all novus ordo masses are invalid ni do not say that nbut perhaps more and more they become invalid because the ministers lose faith in the real presence nrecently in france a progressive paper conducted a statistical survey to see how many priests no longer have faith in the real presence nthey found that twentytwo percent no longer have the faith the belief in the real presence nbut i think that if they directed this question to all of the priests who are under 50 years of age they would find that fifty percent have lost the faith in the real presence because the young priests have no faith nno faith nlast year bishop adam in our diocese of sion switzerland ordained one priest for my congregation of the holy ghost fathers nthis one priest came from france nhis uncle had died in a road accident when his cab fell in the river nthe uncle had nine children nthe bishop said to the new priest xe2 x80 x9cnow you can say mass for your uncle nnow you are a priest and you can say mass for your uncle xe2 x80 x9d the new priest said xe2 x80 x9cno never xe2 x80 x9d why nit is not useful to say mass for the dead n xe2 x80 x9cno no it is impossible nthey are already in heaven xe2 x80 x9d this young priest who was ordained by the bishop last year for my congregation is now a professor in the minor seminary in switzerland nthey are not learning theology not philosophy not anything nthey learn nothing now nanother example nrecently i had two young potential seminarians come to my house near paris none of them works in a factory and the other is a university student nthey told me they were considering the seminary of paris ni asked them xe2 x80 x9cwhy do you come to see me xe2 x80 x9d they told me that they had a meeting in the house of the oblate of maria with the priest who oversees young men who may have vocations to the priesthood in the diocese of paris nthere was a total of fifteen young men for all of the diocese of paris nduring the meeting the priest before he celebrated the eucharist said xe2 x80 x9ctoday we celebrate the eucharist but we do not believe in the real presence xe2 x80 x9d these two young men said xe2 x80 x9cthat is impossible nwe cannot remain in this seminary xe2 x80 x9d so they came to meet me nthey said that econe is the only seminary where they seem to be able to find the true faith nthey asked for admittance to econe nand i think that they shall be coming to econe next october nbut that is a new religion nit is a protestant religion nthat is a fact nperhaps you can say xe2 x80 x9chow is it possible that the pope gives the authorization to this change nhow is it possible the pope signed this decree nsigned this constitution xe2 x80 x9d i don xe2 x80 x99t know ni don xe2 x80 x99t know nit is a big mystery na big mystery nthere are many proposed theological answers ni cannot subscribe to all of them nsome say the pope is not responsible nperhaps someone gave the pope an injection a drug and he is not responsible nperhaps i don xe2 x80 x99t know nsome say there are two popes a body double ni don xe2 x80 x99t know nsome say the pope was liberal before he was elected pope and perhaps we do not know he gave his name to freemasonry thereby incurring excommunication before the conclave nwe do not know nwe do know now that bugnini was primarily responsible for the change in liturgy and that he is an infamous freemason nand because he had an indiscretion with his masonic appurtenances the pope sent him as a nuncio in iran ni don xe2 x80 x99t know nwe don xe2 x80 x99t know nnow you cannot say that archbishop lefebvre said the pope gave his name to freemasonry nno you cannot say that nit is possible but we do not know nbut if he was excommunicated then he is not pope nnot pope nillegitimate ni don xe2 x80 x99t know nit is a mystery i cannot understand nbut the fact is that the catholic church is being destroyed and now even the pope himself says that nthis pope has referred to the autodemolition of the church nhe said xe2 x80 x9cthe smoke of satan has entered the church xe2 x80 x9d but where are the men responsible for the destruction of the church nwell there they are nthey are the men who destroy the church nwe must show where they are nwhere is this smoke of satan that has entered the church ni do not know but it is the pope himself who said that nand i have these experiences every day ni visit many countries ni was in spain during the christmas holy days nthen i was in bonn near cologne germany three weeks ago to speak at a conference nmany people came nmany people are confused nwhat is happening in the church nthey are anxious nbut many people say that we disobey ndisobey nobedience is relative nit is not absolute nit is relative to the good but not to the evil nwe cannot obey our parents if they command a bad thing nwe cannot obey nit is clear nand i know that in spain for example the situation in the church is very bad nthe new nominees of bishops and many auxiliary bishops are approximately communist marxist and socialist nand so a majority of the bishops in the episcopal conference of spain are progressives nthey are modernists nwhereas the majority of the bishops from spain during the council were conservative nso rome is responsible for the situation of the church in spain because it is rome who approves the nominations for bishops nand we know in france in germany and in europe generally that all of the young bishops are worse than the bishops in spain in that they are more or less marxist nthat is a fact nthat is impossible nhow can they do that ni do not know ni do not know ni have not spent my whole life in rome ni do know rome very well because i was an apostolic delegate and i was in the secretariate of the secretary of state nand i know that very well nbut i think that the devil is in rome as was said by our lady of fatima and our lady of la salette nwe must pray nwe must ask god to put an end to this crisis of the church nbecause if this crisis continues many people will go to hell nthey lose the faith nthey cannot go into the church nthey abandon the faith nyou know that many priests have abandoned the faith nmany priests have gotten married nand many sisters have abandoned their congregations nit is a pity nand it is everywhere ni was in melbourne australia during the 40th international eucharistic congress ncardinal knox who was the man responsible for the eucharistic congress is now the prefect of the congregation for divine worship ni read in the newspaper about a mass cardinal knox celebrated during the eucharistic congress where sensual dancing was performed at the same time the words of the consecration were pronounced nthat is a sacrilege nyou cannot go to that mass nthat is sacrilege nthis is a fact nthey also called me by phone in melbourne to say i was on the list of the bishops attending the eucharistic congress nthey asked me to concelebrate mass with a protestant pastor and a rabbi nay nimpossible nimpossible nno no no no napplause nthis change is not accidental nit is not superficial nit is very deep nvery bad nit is against our faith nagainst our faith nand so we cannot accept this council and this reform and this orientation even though it comes from rome nfrom rome we expect only the good nwe do not expect the bad the ill we do not expect the abandonment of adoration in the mass nwe need this adoration nwe need to have the faith in the divinity of jesus christ nbecause all of this change is oriented against the divinity of jesus christ against the kingdom of jesus christ against the real presence of jesus christ in the mass nit is a sin when we abandon the truth of the kingdom of jesus christ everywhere and we abandon the faith of the divinity of jesus christ nhe is king because he is god nhe is the son of god nso he is king by his nature nthis is essential nessential nand if he is god we must give him the adoration of god nand so we cannot accept the diminution of this truth njesus christ is the son of god njesus christ is god nthat is a fundamental truth of our faith nand it all depends on this truth nand we know now that the theologians and the bishops have a new orientation nthey do not express this truth clearly and perfectly nthey are afraid of the truth nthat is very bad nand it is the same in rome ni think they refuse to grant me an audience with the pope because they are afraid of the truth nwhen i was in rome one month ago mgr nbenelli told me he visits the pope every day nhe said that when he left me he would go immediately to the pope to express the importance of the work we had conducted during our meeting nimmediately he said he would be going nso why do they not grant me the possibility of visiting the pope nbecause they are afraid nmeanwhile the vatican operated a veritable swinging door where actual heretics and schismatics were concerned nhere again is blessed paul vi famously meeting for the first time ever with the heretic archbishop of canterbury in st peter  ncardinal villot said xe2 x80 x9cwe are afraid if msgr nlefebvre meets and speaks with the pope that perhaps the pope will change his mind xe2 x80 x9d because the pope is not too sure the pope is not man of true conviction nhe is a mysterious man nwe cannot give a definition of the man nhe expresses the truth and then he does the contraryopposite nsome part of him will speak the truth nanother part of him is open to error nvery curious nand they are afraid that if i reveal the truth and tell the pope xe2 x80 x9cyou must affirm the kingdom of jesus christ everywhere and always each day nyou must affirm the real presence in the mass  in the sacrifice of the mass xe2 x80 x9d then perhaps it is possible that the pope will change his mind nand so cardinal villot says there is a confusion and they do not want me to visit the pope nit is impossible to admit me nand i know the pope very well nwhen i was the apostolic delegate to pius xii i was going to rome every year nand during those eleven years i met msgr nmontini ni know him very well nhe received me twice during the council for a private audience with the pope nbut now with my position against the council and the reforms he says xe2 x80 x9cno impossible nyou must sign in writing that you accept the council and all the reforms before i will receive you in audience xe2 x80 x9d but i cannot do that nfor me if i do that then i betray my mother the church nthe church nso i thank you very much for your encouragement and i must say that we have a very good generation of young men and good vocations nfor the coming year we have 59 applications to our seminary in econe switzerland xe2 x80 x93 applications from the united states from england from germany from france and spain ngood young men with good dispositions are coming from everywhere nand why nwhy do they come to this seminary when they know we are in difficulties with rome nthey know that nbut still they come ni ask them why do you come to econe nyou know our situation nthey say xe2 x80 x9cyes we know your situation but we want to become true priests and not protestant pastors or modernist priests nwe are coming to your seminary because we know that the end of the priest is to offer the true sacrifice of the mass nand so we are coming to econe xe2 x80 x9d nand as i have visited my seminary here in armada for the past five days i can see it is the same here nwe have very good young men ni also have some americans in my seminary in econe nin six weeks i will ordain one american priest from detroit who is a very good seminarian and will be a good priest nbut these young men refuse to become protestants nthey refuse to become modernist nthey ask to become true priests nand it is a pity there are not 100 bishops opening good seminaries nso i ask you to pray for these seminarians because when they become priests they will have many worries and many difficulties ni think however they are very well prepared to deal with these difficulties and worries nand we have confidence in god nsince i began this work six years ago now i have evidence that god is assisting us nbecause it is impossible i realize to do this by myself nwe now have houses in switzerland 3 munich france 6 brussels 1 england armada san francisco and new york nin albano near rome we have a congregation of sisters where i have five vocations from the states good sisters nand i am building a seminary in switzerland nit is impossible to do all this without god xe2 x80 x99s assistance nso i have confidence nit is impossible for the church to change its tradition nthe tradition of twenty centuries nthat we cannot change nthe church is tradition nthe church is tradition nit is not revolution ni thank you for your attention nnotes n1 archbishop benelli who had the title of xe2 x80 x9csubstitute xe2 x80

impeachment for and conviction of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors narticle 2 section 4 of the us constitution nright off the bat this appears to be clear bribery and a case could be made for treason nhowever it is now being reported that an fbi informant that was involved in the uranium one deal has told congressional committees that moscow paid lobbyists to influence thensecretary of state hillary clinton by helping former president bill clinton xe2 x80 x99s charities during the obama administration nthe hill  john solomon reported on wednesday nthe informant douglas campbell said in the statement obtained by the hill that he was told by russian nuclear executives that moscow had hired the american lobbying firm apco worldwide specifically because it was in position to influence the obama administration and more specifically hillary clinton n campbell added in the testimony that russian nuclear officials xe2 x80 x9ctold me at various times that they expected apco to apply a portion of the 3 million annual lobbying fee it was receiving from the russians to provide inkind support for the clintons  global initiative n xe2 x80 x9cthe contract called for four payments of 750000 over twelve months napco was expected to give assistance free of charge to the clinton global initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from uranium one to the usrussia civilian nuclear cooperation agreement napco officials told the hill that its support for the clinton global initiative and its work with russia were not connected in any way and in fact involved different divisions of the firm nthey added their lobbying for russia did not involve uranium one but rather focused on regulatory issues aimed at helping russia better compete for nuclear fuel contracts inside the united states nin case you are unfamiliar with uranium one it is a canadian mining company whose sale to a russian firm was approved in 2010 nthe sale gave the russians control of part of the us uranium supply thus why i reference a case could be made for treason nwhile democrats have unsurprisingly questioned campbell  credibility campbell  attorney victoria toensing told sean hannity xe2 x80 x9cthe russians were so confident that they told mr campbell with the clinton xe2 x80 x99s help it was a shooin to get cfius the committee on foreign investment in the united states approval nthey were so confident in that that they even had him open up the new office because they were planning on the kind of business they were going to do as soon as cfius approved it xe2 x80 x9d nin a lengthy report by awardwinning national securitywar correspondent sara carter she pointed out

work on russia and stated that during his time as an informant he obtained information that russia was continuing to aid the iranian government naccording to campbell russia provided the resources necessary for the nation xe2 x80 x99s nuclear reactors despite promises that they were not sharing such technology with iran nin an april 16 2010 summary brief provided to his former fbi handlers and obtained by this reporter he stressed his deep concerns about tenex a wholly owned subsidiary of the russian state nuclear arm rosatom and its ongoing work to provide iran with the technology needed for its nuclear reactor program nat the time rosatom was seeking the approval to purchase the canadian mining company uranium one n xe2 x80 x9ctenex continues to supply iran with fuel through their russian company tvel xe2 x80 x9d stated campbell in a 2010 brief provided to the fbi ntvel is a russian nuclear fuel cycle company headquartered in moscow n xe2 x80 x9cthey tvel continue to assist with construction consult and fabricated assemblies to supply the reactor nfabricated assemblies require sophisticated engineering and are arranged inside the reactor with the help and consult of tvel xe2 x80 x9d campbell informed the fbi of the close relationship between tvel and tenex both a part of the rosatom group nhe stated in his brief that while spending time with the russian executives from both rosatom and tenex that any mention of xe2 x80 x9ctvel is a subject that is serious to all when mentioned ni do not even raise the subject of tvel to our friends but occasionally they speak of it and always in a guarded manner xe2 x80 x9d in the briefs he informed the fbi that xe2 x80 x9coccasionally someone will mention having been in iran but usually it is long after the fact xe2 x80 x9d and when he asked the russians about these connections he stated that they xe2 x80 x9coccasionally speak of the relationship ie nequipment consulting ni asked vadim mikerin if they felt there was a serious problem and would they adhere to sanctions and western opinion nhis response was a smile and shoulder shrug xe2 x80 x9d but campbell had provided the fbi with evidence of the criminal network and delivered the information to the fbi which was monitoring his work as an informant and approving his transfer of bribery money to the russians nthose transfers which were made in bulk 50000 sums and at times delivered in cash occurred between senior executives of the american transportation company and the russian executives connected to rosatom nhe had given the fbi irrefutable evidence showing how contracts obtained from the same russian energy company tenex were based on contract bribery and other nefarious actions he said nsenior members of the fbi department of treasury department of energy and department of justice were also briefed on campbell xe2 x80 x99s information and were apprised of the various facets pertaining to russia xe2 x80 x99s acquisition of the

companies at the direction of and for the benefit of a russian official vadim mikerin in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with tenex nin order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared purportedly from tenex to transportation corporation a that described services that were never provided and then lambert and others caused transportation corporation a to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in latvia cyprus and switzerland

cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices and tenex thus overpaid for transportation corporation a xe2 x80 x99s services nin june 2015 lambert xe2 x80 x99s former copresident daren condrey pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the fcpa and commit wire fraud and vadim mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the fcpa nmikerin is currently

lifted in october ncampbell was a highly valued cia and fbi asset deeply embedded in the russian nuclear industry while robert mueller was the director of the fbi nwhile robert mueller was the director of the fbi campbell was required by the russians under threat to launder large sums of money  which allowed the fbi to uncover a massive russian nuclear money laundering apparatus  n he collected over 5000 documents and briefs over a six year period some of which detail efforts by moscow to route money to the clinton foundation ncampbell claims to have video evidence of bribe money related to the uranium one deal being stuffed into suitcases nof bribe money related to the uranium one deal being stuffed into suitcases nthe obama fbi knew about the bribery scheme yet the administration still approved the uranium one deal nto thank him for his service campbell was paid 51000 by fbi officials at a 2016 celebration dinner in chrystal city nwhen it emerged that campbell had evidence against the clinton foundation a yahoo news article by michael isikoff of fisa warrant application fame slammed campbell as a disaster potential witness nall of this then goes back to things we have pointed out with ranchers in the western united states and how this impacts them as well as the land grabs that are unconstitutionally orchestrated by the dc government and the bureau of land management nthere is also substantial documentation that was discovered in oregon that relates to this deal during the oregon occupation in 2016 which got zero coverage in the mainstream media

properly reflect the position of cardinal marx xe2 x80 x9d nthe cardinal xe2 x80 x99s office maintains that rather than saying xe2 x80 x9cyes xe2 x80 x9d there is a possibility of liturgical xe2 x80 x9cblessing xe2 x80 x9d of gay unions he answered the question in a more subtle way without giving an explicit xe2 x80 x9cyes xe2 x80 x9d however the german bishops xe2 x80 x99 conference doesn xe2 x80 x99t seem to deny the rest of his statements on how xe2 x80 x9cone must encourage priests xe2 x80 x9d to give encouragement to homosexual couples which could include public blessings that would

a way the church considers gravely sinful and spiritually damaging and therefore would be uncharitable n xe2 x80 x9cthere is no love xe2 x80 x93 no charity xe2 x80 x93 without truth just as there is

intention only makes a difficult task more difficult xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cthere are two principles we need to remember xe2 x80 x9d chaput wrote n xe2 x80 x9cfirst we need to treat all people with the respect and pastoral concern they deserve as children of god with inherent dignity nthis emphatically includes persons with samesex attraction nsecond there is no truth no real mercy and no authentic compassion in blessing a course of action that leads persons away from god xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cthis in no way is a rejection of the persons seeking such a blessing but rather a refusal to ignore what we know to be true about the nature of marriage the family and the dignity of human sexuality xe2 x80 x9d he explained n xe2 x80 x9cjesus said the truth will make us free nnowhere did

131,special report papal coverup alleged pope accused in international sex abuse case n nhey remember five minutes ago when pope francis shouted at a reporter in chile that there was xe2 x80 x9cno evidence xe2 x80 x9d supporting complaints against his good friend bishop juan barros nand just for good measure he accused the people accusing him xe2 x80 x93 victims of sexual abuse by barros xe2 x80 x99 mentor the convicted sexpredator karadima xe2 x80 x93 of committing xe2 x80 x9ccalumny xe2 x80 x9d n1 and remember when cardinal o xe2 x80 x99malley told the pope off in public over the xe2 x80 x9cpain xe2 x80 x9d these accusations had caused the victims of sexual abuse nand then remember how the pope had apologisedexceptnotreally because the accusations are after all still lies and that there xe2 x80 x99s still xe2 x80 x9cno evidence xe2 x80 x9d against barros xe2 x80 xa6 nthe press secular as well as catholic is full this week of the story that the pope did indeed see evidence of barros xe2 x80 x99 complicity in karadima xe2 x80 x99s sexual abuse xe2 x80 x93 not only that barros had helped to cover it up but that he had been present and a direct witness at the time and therefore a passive participant nnicole winfield and the associated press dropped the bomb that the information came directly from the victims whom francis had dismissed and refused to meet with on his trip and delivered through his own commission on sexual abuse npope francis received a victim xe2 x80 x99s letter in 2015 that graphically detailed how a priest sexually abused him and how other chilean clergy ignored it contradicting the pope xe2 x80 x99s recent insistence that no victims had come forward to denounce the coverup the letter xe2 x80 x99s author and members of francis xe2 x80 x99 own sex abuse commission have told the associated press n nthe fact that francis received the eightpage letter obtained by the ap challenges his insistence that he has xe2 x80 x9czero tolerance xe2 x80 x9d for sex abuse and coverups nit also calls into question his stated empathy with abuse survivors compounding the most serious crisis of his fiveyear papacy nnow it appears that francis had also overruled a 2015 warning from the congregation for the doctrine of the faith that barros should not be made a bishop nthe italian catholic daily la nuova bussola quotidiana reports that not only did the pope see a letter from victims but that the cdf under muller xe2 x80 x9chad already conducted an preliminary investigation into barros and the other bishops close to karadima which had led to the decision to relieve them of their duties xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cbut with a letter signed by the pope in january 2015 and sent to the chilean bishops the request for exemption is blocked and shortly thereafter barros is promoted to xe2 x80 xa6osorno xe2 x80 x9d nthe article points out that while karadima was convicted by a vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victims it is the same testimony of the same victimwitnesses that francis now dismisses in the accusations against barros nthe accusations that stood against karadima come from the same sources as those against barros who the victims said was in the room watching at the time nwhile the specifics are still not known readers may be reminded by this of a peculiar incident about a year later in which pope francis summarily ordered the dismissal of three priests of the cdf whose remit was investigations of clerics accused of sexual abuse nthe website one peter five reports via marco tosatti that the pope ordered their removal without offering any explanation to thencardinal prefect gerhard muller nwhen after several attempts and three months later2 muller was able to get an audience with the pope to ask the reason he received the response xe2 x80 x9ci am the pope i do not need to give reasons for any of my decisions ni have decided that they have to leave and they have to leave xe2 x80 x9d nmarco tosatti reports the cdf incident but it follows an odd story of a meeting of curial officials to discuss certain bishop appointments nwithout naming names or frustratingly giving dates3 tosatti relates n xe2 x80 x9cit was some time ago to make a bishop not in italy nthe nuncio has prepared the triad the xe2 x80 x9cterna xe2 x80 x9d or list of three candidates na cardinal head of the dicastery perhaps the same holder of the congregation for bishops during the ordinary assembly took the floor saying xe2 x80 x98the first candidate indicated is excellent the second is good nbut i would like to warn of the third whom i know well since he was a seminarian and who presents problems both on the level of doctrine and morality nhe responds little to the necessary criteria nbut the third was a friend of someone and another cardinal of the circle currently in power has flung himself at his colleague accusing him of impropriety xe2 x80 x99 the meeting ended without further decisions xe2 x80 x9d nwhatever the details of these strange incidents what is clear in chile is that no amount of eyewitness testimony was going to make the slightest difference nbergoglio wanted barros as a bishop and that was that neven while xe2 x80 x9capologising xe2 x80 x9d the pope had doubled down when questioned about it by journalists saying xe2 x80 x9cyou in all good will tell me that there are victims but i haven xe2 x80 x99t seen any because they haven xe2 x80 x99t come forward xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cin the case of barros it xe2 x80 x99s been observed it xe2 x80 x99s been studied there xe2 x80 x99s no evidence nthe best thing to do if someone believes it xe2 x80 x99s the case is to come forward quickly with evidence xe2 x80 x9d nthe ap report however says exactly the opposite that members of his own now defunct4 abuse commission had approached cardinal o xe2 x80 x99malley the pope xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9ctop abuse advisor xe2 x80 x9d with the letter to deliver to the pope nmarie collins the irish abuse survivor and commission member who resigned citing the vatican xe2 x80 x99s refusal to take meaningful action told ap xe2 x80 x9cwhen we gave him o xe2 x80 x99malley the letter for the pope he assured us he would give it to the pope and speak of the concerns nand at a later date he assured us that that had been done xe2 x80 x9d juan carlos cruz the karadima victim whose membership on the commission the vatican had blocked told ap xe2 x80 x9ccardinal o xe2 x80 x99malley called me after the pope xe2 x80 x99s visit here in philadelphia and he told me among other things that he had given the letter to the pope xe2 x80 x93 in his hands xe2 x80 x9d non the face of it there are only a few logical possibilities here nin fact unless cardinal o xe2 x80 x99malley xe2 x80 x93 who has as of this writing remained silent xe2 x80 x93 comes forward and says that he didn xe2 x80 x99t hand the letter over pope there is really only one that the pope lied nand this is what is now being said quite openly by a vast array of voices secular and catholic left and right nas winfield writes n xe2 x80 x9cthe revelation could be costly for francis whose track record on the abuse crisis was already shaky after a botched italian abuse case he intervened in became public5 nmore recently he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year nvatican analysts now openly question whether he xe2 x80 x98gets it xe2 x80 x99 and some of his own advisers privately acknowledge that maybe he doesn xe2 x80 x99t xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cno evidence xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d lie big lie often and when caught keep lying none of the many things these secular reporters seem not to be paying attention to is that xe2 x80 x9cno evidence xe2 x80 x9d is in fact a wellrehearsed stock response for bergoglio nhe said almost exactly the same in 2013 when confronted about another predatory homosexual he was sheltering nthe hoopla surrounding the xe2 x80 x9cwho am i to judge xe2 x80 x9d comment tends to obscure the context of the comment nit was made in response to a question by a journalist about monsignore battista ricca xe2 x80 x93 a prelate whose promiscuous homosexuality is so well known it was covered by the telegraph as early as july 2013 nilze scamparini asked the pope about ricca saying xe2 x80 x9cwhat you intend to do about this nhow are you confronting this issue and how does your holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby xe2 x80 x9d nwhat reply did bergoglio give nhis standard one xe2 x80 x9cno evidence xe2 x80 x9d nabout monsignor ricca i did what canon law calls for that is a preliminary investigation nand from this investigation there was nothing of what had been alleged nwe did not find anything of that nthis is the response xe2 x80 x9d nhe added xe2 x80 x9cin this case i conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn xe2 x80 x99t find anything xe2 x80 x9d nbut ricca xe2 x80 x99s activities for which the pope claimed there was no evidence were notorious nthey include being caught in flagrante in an elevator with a teenaged male prostitute and his sexual relationship with a captain in the swiss army nso flagrant was ricca xe2 x80 x99s behaviour that it took intervention by uruguay xe2 x80 x99s nuncio to have him removed nit was reported in 1999 and 2000 by l xe2 x80 x99espresso who said the information was confirmed by xe2 x80 x9cnumerous bishops priests religious and laity xe2 x80 x9d in uruguay6 nin fact the evidence shows that ricca is completely in line with bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s normal procedures nas xe2 x80 x9cmarcantonio colonna xe2 x80 x9d wrote in the dictator pope xe2 x80 x9cin fact his patronage of monsignor ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was archbishop of buenos aires whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb xe2 x80 x9d nit was at this early xe2 x80 x9cno evidence xe2 x80 x9d comment on the plane home from rio that some of those paying attention started to understand that bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s policy is in line with that of certain leaders of the past who recommended that if a politician was going to lie he should lie big and lie brazenly nand in case anyone was wondering what will happen next the same advice said to keep on lying after you xe2 x80 x99re caught nthe pattern of silence and when pressed flatout denial has been bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s policy since long before he came on the international scene nhe has a long record in argentina of shaving close to scandals and vociferously denying involvement and relying heavily on the broad good will of catholics towards bishops to pull it off nperhaps his biggest error with barros was failing to understand just how little of that capital of trust there is left in the catholic world as a whole nindeed on the subject of priests sexually abusing young people it could only be measured in the negative numbers n xe2 x80 x9cargentine victims who tried to meet with pope francis xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d nthough the website bishop accountability is blatantly anticlerical their data is unassailable since most of it comes from information that is already public non their argentina page is a long list of accusations that bergogliofrancis simply isn xe2 x80 x99t interested in hearing from victims n xe2 x80 x9cin pope francis xe2 x80 x99s 21 years as bishop and archbishop of buenos aires the wall street journal reports including the years when he headed the argentine bishops xe2 x80 x99 conference he declined to meet with victims of sexual abuse xe2 x80 x9d n n xe2 x80 x9call of them tried to contact the cardinal archbishop in 2002 or later xe2 x80 x9d the same period when pope benedict and other bishops were striving to meet with victims and demonstrate an interest in the problem nthe site says that xe2 x80 x9cin addition to bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s failure to respond to victims the public record contains no evidence that he released any information about abusers xe2 x80 x9d nin fact he went so far as to flatly deny there had been any instances of abuse in his archdiocese nweeks after his election to the papacy he was quoted by his close friend rabbi abraham skorka xe2 x80 x9cin my diocese it never happened to me but a bishop called me once by phone to ask me what to do in a situation like this xe2 x80 x9d francis added that he agreed with the xe2 x80 x9czero tolerance xe2 x80 x9d attitude of the irish episcopate and admired pope benedict xe2 x80 x99s reforms xe2 x80 x93 most of which he was later to quietly reverse nit was at exactly this time however that victims from argentina were attempting to get the new pope xe2 x80 x99s attention none known to the press only as xe2 x80 x9cgabriel xe2 x80 x9d wanted to talk to francis about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of julio c xc3 xa9sar grassi accused of molesting at least five boys xe2 x80 x9cwho has been avoiding the sentences of the justice of mor xc3 xb3n and the court of cassation nso far judges and prosecutors at all instances found him guilty xe2 x80 x9d nin case anyone thinks the grassigabriel case was not serious enough for the pope xe2 x80 x99s attention bishop accountability summarises xe2 x80 x9ca year after gabriel had filed criminal charges 2003 but before the start of grassi xe2 x80 x99s trial three men ransacked the survivor xe2 x80 x99s apartment and beat him xe2 x80 x9d these men threatened to kill him if he did not retract his testimony and quit the case nten years after gabriel filed criminal charges in may 2013 with grassi still free despite his conviction in 2009 xe2 x80 x9cgabriel and his attorney juan pablo gallego brought a twopage letter addressed to pope francis to the office of the papal nuncio in buenos aires nan employee refused to accept the letter after learning of its topic and threatened to call security if gabriel and gallego did not leave the premises xe2 x80 x9d nthe group surmises that it was bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s direct intervention with judges in the case that prevented a conviction against grassi for so long and delayed his sentencing through multiple appeals nin 2006 thenarchbishop bergoglio complained of a xe2 x80 x9cmedia campaign xe2 x80 x9d and claimed that the grassi case was xe2 x80 x9cdifferent xe2 x80 x9d from other accusations nduring his criminal trial grassi said bergoglio xe2 x80 x9cnever let go xe2 x80 x9d of his hand nin 2009 grassi was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and corruption in the case of xe2 x80 x9cgabriel xe2 x80 x9d who was aged 13 at the time of the abuse but the appeals dragged on until he was finally sent to prison in september 2013 nseveral more similar cases all of whom were rebuffed in their attempts to meet with bergoglio are detailed here for the strongofstomach na virtuoso performanceliar nlooking back and carefully examining his record jorge bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s mastery of using the weaknesses of morally compromised men is becoming evident nit is arguable that even the members of the socalled xe2 x80 x9csan gallen mafia xe2 x80 x9d who apparently conspired to put him on peter xe2 x80 x99s throne were used by him nbut he is also a master of judging an audience and telling them what they expect to hear a key skill for all grifters and confidence tricksters nlooking carefully at the infamous xe2 x80 x9cwho am i to judge xe2 x80 x9d comment this was clear early on nthe first part of that interview is a blatant and enormous lie and it was from there that the pope moved on to his apology for homosexuality in general nrecall that this was the very first airplane interview on the trip back to rome from world youth day in rio a matter of weeks after his election nat the time the papal apologists sprang instantly into action and we heard all about how the pope was talking strictly within the boundaries of catholic doctrine nbut perhaps in hindsight we are ready to examine the full implications of his little speech one that was clearly wellrehearsed ndon xe2 x80 x99t forget no question is asked in a papal interview without being thoroughly vetted ahead of time njournalists must submit their questions well in advance nthis was the pope laying out his policy regarding homosexuality a policy for which he was duly rewarded by being lauded on the cover of the homosexualist lobby xe2 x80 x99s us trade magazine nread his full answer carefully ni see that many times in the church over and above this case but including this case people search for xe2 x80 x9csins from youth xe2 x80 x9d for example and then publish them nthey are not crimes right ncrimes are something different the abuse of minors is a crime nno sins n nbut if a person whether it be a lay person a priest or a religious sister commits a sin and then converts the lord forgives and when the lord forgives the lord forgets and this is very important for our lives nwhen we confess our sins and we truly say xe2 x80 x9ci have sinned in this xe2 x80 x9d the lord forgets and so we have no right not to forget because otherwise we would run the risk of the lord not forgetting our sins nthat is a danger n nthis is important a theology of sin nmany times i think of saint peter nhe committed one of the worst sins that is he denied christ and even with this sin they made him pope nwe have to think a great deal about that n nbut returning to your question more concretely nin this case i conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn xe2 x80 x99t find anything nthis is the first question nthen you spoke about the gay lobby nso much is written about the gay lobby ni still haven xe2 x80 x99t found anyone with an identity card in the vatican with xe2 x80 x9cgay xe2 x80 x9d on it nthey say there are some there n ni believe that when you are dealing with such a person you must distinguish between the fact of a person being gay and the fact of someone forming a lobby because not all lobbies are good nthis one is not good n nif someone is gay and is searching for the lord and has good will then who am i to judge him nthe catechism of the catholic church explains this in a beautiful way saying  wait a moment how does it say it  it says xe2 x80 x9cno one should marginalize these people for this they must be integrated into society xe2 x80 x9d nthe problem is not having this tendency no we must be brothers and sisters to one another and there is this one and there is that one nthe problem is in making a lobby of this tendency a lobby of misers a lobby of politicians a lobby of masons so many lobbies nfor me this is the greater problem nthank you so much for asking this question nmany thanks none of the pope xe2 x80 x99s favourite rhetorical techniques is a combination of begging the question and conspiracy nhe starts by assuming without any effort at defence or explanation a point that concedes the whole issue nthis was the first time a pope had ever used the political term xe2 x80 x9cgay xe2 x80 x9d nnot xe2 x80 x9chomosexual xe2 x80 x9d not xe2 x80 x9csamesex attracted xe2 x80 x9d but xe2 x80 x9cgay xe2 x80 x9d meaning that he started by adopting the entirety of the homosexualist movement xe2 x80 x99s linguistic manipulations nlanguage counts in politics and a pope using that term means he is by implication starting the discussion xe2 x80 x93 and his pontificate xe2 x80 x93 by aligning himself with the basic tenets of a movement that is violently opposed to catholic moral teaching and in direct opposition to his immediate and still living predecessor nin this case too he was addressing a plane load of journalists who were either secular themselves or for the most part are the kind of catholic who believes it is fine to xe2 x80 x9cdisagree xe2 x80 x9d with catholic teaching on sexuality nthere are very few xe2 x80 x9cconservative xe2 x80 x9d catholics in the vatican journalist pool nthis means that his use of this language was a conspiratorial wink and nod to his immediate audience a sly message to say xe2 x80 x9cpeople talk all the time about a gay lobby but you and i both know this is mostly nonsense propaganda from those people xe2 x80 xa6 those conservatives xe2 x80 xa6we cool and hip people don xe2 x80 x99t hate gays do we xe2 x80 x9d nthis astonishing departure follows an implied but very clear assertion that ricca has repented and given up his activity an assertion that has absolutely no evidence to back it up nwe are simply asked to take the pope xe2 x80 x99s word for it but given that it follows his astoundingly brazen lie that there was no evidence for ricca xe2 x80 x99s homosexual activity in the first place we can take the assurance for what it seems to be worth nnext after another little inside nudgenudgewinkwink joke about the xe2 x80 x9cgay lobby xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x93 implying but of course never outright saying that the whole thing is hysterical nonsense xe2 x80 x93 we hear a direct contradiction to catholic teaching from no less a source than his predecessor pope benedict ratzinger n xe2 x80 x9cthe problem is not having this tendency xe2 x80 x9d well actually your holiness yes it is particularly in the case of priests nthe xe2 x80 x9ctendency xe2 x80 x9d is called in the same catechism you quote xe2 x80 x9cintrinsically disordered xe2 x80 x9d and ratzinger was very clear that this xe2 x80 x9ctendency xe2 x80 x9d is a sign of a serious emotional dysfunction that xe2 x80 x9cmust xe2 x80 x9d preclude a man from being ordained nsquandering the capital of trust na few months ago in a piece for the remnant i talked about why the church and nearly all human societies regard lying as a sin na mistake many make about lying is to understand it only in terms of morality nbut thomas makes the point that it is first a matter of metaphysics nlying is an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality nthomistic theology teaches that it is by lying that we become most like the devil and most unlike god because we are trying to change the nature of reality to suit our own purposes nhabitual lying in effect changes you into a different kind of being one that is by nature an opponent of truth ordered against truth nthis of course means that a person whose xe2 x80 x9corientation xe2 x80 x9d as we might say is towards falsehood even when he is at any given moment saying something true is still servicing his lies nhe tells the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality nit was not by violence but by lying and manipulation by issuing halftruths and pretending to be the kind of man he was not that shakespeare xe2 x80 x99s character iago earned the title of most evil character in english literature nhuman beings are naturally ordered towards the truth and we have to work at assuming a lie nthis is why confidence tricksters can be successful why lying works for getting what you want people don xe2 x80 x99t see it coming nthe first natural assumption is trust at least at the basic level of expecting truth most of the time nwe therefore instinctively see lying as a betrayal of trust nconsidering how much trust the catholic faithful had in the papacy until about 1965 how much unearned trust francis started with just by being elected this pontificate should be remembered as one of the great confidence scams in history nbelieving catholics have watched aghast as this pope has habitually trampled on every aspect of catholic teaching nsandro magister recently published a piece on his website that listed in dizzying detail the many times in only the last few months that pope francis has falsified with obvious intention the words of christ in scripture and the teaching of the church nof course this would be of little interest to secular journalists who have paid no mind to his habit of rewriting catholicism but the sex abuse crisis is something secular journalists are very interested in a fact bergoglio seems not to have understood nit is now irrefutable that pope bergoglio is a habitual liar xe2 x80 x93 that in fact truth like reality seems to mean nothing to him except as a tool nsociologists talk about the concept of the xe2 x80 x9chigh trust society xe2 x80 x9d one in which citizens believe what they are told by the elites and trust them to govern and protect them adequately nthey warn that the general loss of trust in institutions leads to a general state of chaos in which laws on the books matter little as citizens turn to their last resort of protecting themselves and their own families nthis is the way societies disintegrate nit has been said many times that the sex abuse crisis has created a massive loss of trust in prelates among the catholic faithful and this is true nwith a professional confidence trickster on the papal throne blatantly using lies and manipulation to maintain power and ram through an agenda at radical variance with catholic doctrine how long before that predictable disintegration occurs nare we seeing it already nare we seeing it in the declarations of this or that episcopate on amoris laetitia and communion for divorced and civilly remarried catholics nwith cardinal marx and others promoting xe2 x80 x9cblessings xe2 x80 x9d for xe2 x80 x9csamesex unions xe2 x80 x9d are we going to be seeing an escalation of it ni have seen a veritable chorus of catholics on social media declaring that if paul vi is canonised their loss of faith in the church as an institution will be complete ni am told from contacts inside the vatican that after the trip to chile bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s support has completely dried up nhe has no more resources of trust even among the people he has chosen to surround himself with and after the reports of cardinal sandri going toetotoe with him in a shouting match it seems that perhaps even his legendary vicious temper tantrums are failing to have the desired effect of terrorising his subordinates into submission nmarie collins by no stretch even a xe2 x80 x9cconservative xe2 x80 x9d catholic echoed this concern saying the barros affair has xe2 x80 x9cdefinitely undermined credibility trust and hope xe2 x80 x9d in francis n xe2 x80 x9call i can say is that people who had a lot of hope in this particular pope and i am talking about just ordinary catholics that i know in my own parish would find it very difficult now xe2 x80 xa6and cannot understand and cannot believe that this particular pope has said the things he has said in the last few weeks xe2 x80 x9d she told the national catholic reporter nit may seem like a moment to enjoy seeing the apparently unbreachable shell of papal teflon finally cracking but in reality this situation is potentially very harmful for souls in the long run nthere is a multitude of problems this pontificate has created or made worse that we will be dealing with for a long time after bergoglio is gone but perhaps one of the bigger ones will be the destruction of trust nalready fractured since the collapse of all catholic institutions after vatican ii and the horrors of the sex abuse crisis how much will there be to repair of the oncesteadfast trust catholics instinctively had in the church after this nnotes n1 xe2 x80 x9cnot one victim has come forward in chile show me the proof nthis is slander and calumny nis that clear xe2 x80 x9d n2 the book xe2 x80 x9cthe dictator pope xe2 x80 x9d relates that regular meetings between the pope and dicastery heads have been abolished and even highranking curia prefects are often unable to see the pope whose appointments are now completely controlled by the secretariat of state nit is certainly clear that no one sees the pope unless cardinal parolin approves which may be the reason cardinal zen in his efforts to warn francis of the dangers of a vatican deal with the communist chinese government had to wait in the rain at a wednesday general audience n3 this is common in italian journalism that has somewhat different standards from that of the anglo world xe2 x80 xa6 and drives the rest of us spare nitalians care about getting a general picture of what xe2 x80 x99s going on where anglosaxons are considered weirdly obsessed with trivial details n4 though she never blamed the pope marie collins complained that vatican officialdom had simply not implemented the commission xe2 x80 x99s recommendations nthe time limit of the commission xe2 x80 x99s members was allowed to lapse without renewal and though it was not dissolved formally the commission has ceased to function with no word of any plan to revive it n5 probably a reference to the inzoli case in which francis overturned a previous sentence of a vatican tribunal after the priest xe2 x80 x93 now laicised xe2 x80 x93 approached some of the pope xe2 x80 x99s close advisors for help including cardinal coccopalmerio n6 not that anyone in rome was trying very hard nsandro magister reported after the xe2 x80 x9cwho am i to judge xe2 x80 x9d comment xe2 x80 x9cbefore the appointment francis had been shown as is customary the personal file on ricca in which he had not

nabout the clip on facebook zakkout wrote above it xe2 x80 x9cmakes a lot of sense xe2 x80 x9d of course this is coming from someone zakkout who regularly refers to jews as xe2 x80 x9cmonkeys and pigs xe2 x80 x9d and in february 2016 circulated on social media a report claiming that xe2 x80 x9cthe holocaust was faked xe2 x80 x9d the report calls the holocaust xe2 x80 x9cthe biggest lie ever foisted

zakkout declared in arabic hamas is in my heart and on my head nall of the above testifies to hatred and intolerance but it is even more disturbing given the fact that zakkout sits on the boards of

stoppers and citizens xe2 x80 x99 crime watch do not wish to be associated with antisemitism or white supremacism or hamas or holocaust denial or steve anderson or david duke or louis farrakhan then

predators while asking everybody else to simply xe2 x80 x9cmove on xe2 x80 x9d said attorney and child advocate elizabeth yore on an ewtn show last week n xe2 x80 x9ci think this is a misplaced mercy nit is mercy for the predator priests xe2 x80 x9d she told ewtn xe2 x80 x99s raymond arroyo on the february 8 episode of world over n xe2 x80 x9cthere are many people who know the pope from argentina

the francis papacy in this case where the pope appointed a bishop with a history of complicity in child sex abuse nthe pope xe2 x80 x99s claim that he had never received any victim testimony regarding the complicity of chilean bishop juan barros in child sex abuse has proven to be false n xe2 x80 x9cthe barros case is putting the pope for the first time in the middle as a principal in a coverup xe2 x80 x9d yore said during the interview nyore said that not only is it now known that the pope received a letter from one of the victims but it is also now known that he was xe2 x80 x9ctold from the moment he appointed bishop barros in 2015 that this was a bad decision xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cthe chilean archbishop conference told him to revoke this appointment nhe received petitions and letters and calls yet ignored them all xe2 x80 x9d she said nas details continue to surface the pontiff xe2 x80 x99s professed empathy for abuse victims has come into question as well nyore called the child sex abuse case involving infamous chilean priest abuser father fernando karadima and bishop juan barros xe2 x80 x9ca scandal of epic proportions xe2 x80 x9d nthe scandal signals that the church under francis is slipping backwards in its handling of abuse said yore nyore called the example pope francis set in the way he handled the abuse information xe2 x80 x9cextremely dangerous xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cbut it is extremely dangerous as the head of the catholic church xe2 x80 x94 you know the last appeal xe2 x80 x94 that this is the kind of behavior that is going to be mimicked around the world by bishops who will say xe2 x80 x98well if the pope is not going to intervene and impose zero tolerance why should i xe2 x80 x99 xe2 x80 x9d nreports say pope francis personally received the eightpage letter from the chilean victim graphically detailing the alleged abuses by karadima and linking barros as having witnessed and covered up the abuse nthe alleged abuse took place decades prior to francis xe2 x80 x99s 2015 appointment of barros to the diocese of osorno in southern chile npope francis received the victim xe2 x80 x99s letter in 2015 its author and a member of francis xe2 x80 x99s sex abuse commission have said contradicting the pope xe2 x80 x99s recent insistence that no victims had come forward in the matter and no evidence had been produced nfrancis encountered protests in chile over his defense of barros during his visit there last month calling the accusations against the priest xe2 x80 x9ccalumny xe2 x80 x9d nwhile francis later apologized he persisted in defending barros denying that he had received any testimony himself and restating that such unproven accusations are xe2 x80 x9cslander xe2 x80 x9d nthe pope later said he would send malta archbishop charles scicluna xe2 x80 x93 the former top vatican abuse investigator  to chile to investigate the matter nexpectations were high in 2014 when the pope created the abuse commission nand while he has continually condemned clergy sex abuse throughout his pontificate some have argued his actions in some serious cases don xe2 x80 x99t match his tough stances on abuse nfour members of the commission had met with cardinal o xe2 x80 x99malley in 2015 conveying their objections to francis xe2 x80 x99s 2015 appointment of barros as bishop of osorno nit was at the meeting with o xe2 x80 x99malley that the abuse commission representatives reportedly gave the letter to the cardinal to deliver to francis and o xe2 x80 x99malley later confirmed to a commission member that he had in fact personally delivered the letter to the pope nyore explained that the pope has been told from the moment he appointed barros in 2015 that it was a bad decision between the chilean bishops xe2 x80 x99 conference petitions letters and calls that were all ignored nfurther a chilean judicial inquiry found all the victims who testified xe2 x80 x94 including the letter xe2 x80 x99s author juan carlos xe2 x80 x94 to be credible and that there was a major coverup of the abuse by father karadima narroyo spoke with cruz as well who said he was xe2 x80 x9cincredibly frustrated xe2 x80 x9d when barros was going to be appointed nhe xe2 x80 x99d testified about three bishops who had witnessed abuse he said but barros had special significance for him because barros xe2 x80 x99 part went beyond witnessing the abuse to violating his seal of confession with karadima and psychological abuse through intimidation ncruz recounted how he and other victims had been dismissed or slandered by local church hierarchy for numerous attempts to be heard nand he spoke about holding out hope that there would be a different response from the pope discussing specifics of getting the letter to the francis via cardinal o xe2 x80 x99malley ncruz told arroyo he was really hurt and felt betrayed by the pope xe2 x80 x99s comments that the accusations were slander and there were no witnesses or evidence n xe2 x80 x9cto hear him talk about us that way xe2 x80 x9d cruz said xe2 x80 x9ccalling us slanderers it was terrible because it set the clock back for so many victims xe2 x80 x9d nscicluna will be meeting with cruz who said he hopes other abuse survivors will be heard as a result of his case coming more to the forefront n xe2 x80 x9cthis leaves us with very strong evidence that the pope was in fact aware of what has happened xe2 x80 x9d yore said n xe2 x80 x9chere we have victims 10 15 years after their abuse begging the pope having to take pictures of a letter that xe2 x80 x99s handed to a cardinal to ensure that there is evidence that the pope is receiving this information xe2 x80 x9d nthe whole of latin america including argentina was well aware of what was happening when this case broke in chile in 2010 yore noted and yet the pope continues to shrug his shoulders and say he has no information nthis was precisely what he xe2 x80 x99d been saying when he was cardinal and archbishop in buenos aires she said that no one ever came forward with information and there were never any cases of clerical abuse in the entirety of the twomillionplus member archdiocese of buenos aires n xe2 x80 x9cthis isn xe2 x80 x99t just simply a coverup of a predator priest xe2 x80 x9d yore stated n xe2 x80 x9cthis is barros present in the room when the abuse is ongoing with these young minor boys xe2 x80 x9d nshe said she would argue as a child advocate that barros was involved in sexual exploitation of children n xe2 x80 x9cso i don xe2 x80 x99t think this is simply just a case as bad as it is of a coverup of an abuser xe2 x80 x9d she said n xe2 x80 x9cthis is also sexual exploitation of children in a grooming gang a predator priest nthis is why it is so heinous xe2 x80 x9d nyore said that given the church xe2 x80 x99s sex abuse crisis one would have thought going into the 2013 conclave which elected francis that an obvious priority in vetting candidates for the papacy would have meant a serious look at their history of handling abuse allegations in their previous sees nthere are more cases out there just like barros that have been covered up yore told arroyo maybe even some even worse than the barros case n xe2 x80 x9cthose cases are going to be haunting this papacy and really causing a rift in the major protection of children that pope benedict had worked very hard to really build up xe2 x80 x9d she said n xe2 x80 x9ctrust within the faithful and to put in a system that was going to root out the predators nand i think that has just been blown up and i think we are back to square one

146,austrian bishop forcefully rejects german bishops xe2 x80 x99 idea of blessing homosexual unions n nnewscatholic church nsalzburg austria february 13 2018 lifesitenews xe2 x80 x93 the indignation about cardinal reinhard marx and bishop franzjosef bode xe2 x80 x93 the president and the vice president of the german bishops conference xe2 x80 x93 and their direct or more indirect encouragement of blessing homosexual unions is growing by the day nnow bishop emeritus andreas laun xe2 x80 x93 one of the signatories of the kazakh xe2 x80 x9cprofession of truth about sacramental marriage xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x93 has written a strong commentary for the austrian catholic news website kathnet on the recent episcopal initiatives coming out of germany nin the following we shall present to our readers the essential parts of bishop laun statement in our english translation from the german n ndear cardinal marx and dear bishop bode there is only one catholic answer no nand your addition xe2 x80 x9cin individual cases xe2 x80 x9d is absolutely worthless it has no argumentative force na clear statement by bishop andreas laun for kathnet ncardinal marx and also bishop bode have now opened up to the idea to offer homosexual couples a blessing nwhy not one could say since the church is ready to bless nearly everything on the earth nnow the church especially blesses people but also deeds and objects nthe jesuit father eckhard bieger writes in the internet about catholic blessings nfor catholics really everything can be blessed not only places of worship chalices and the faithful after each prayer service xe2 x80 x93 whether after a mass or after the prayers for the hours of the day nthe blessing is also not limited to rosaries or religious medal but one may also bless cars factory halls animals herbs and much more nsome blessings are only to be made by priests and deacons especially when it is about objects of worship such as chalices or vestments nbut parents can bless their children nthe faithful may also take home holy water and sprinkle it on members of the family but also the stable and the animals thus blessing them n nwhat kind of hope is connected with a blessing nwith regard to the car certainly the wish for heavenly protection xe2 x80 x93 sometimes also expressed with the help of a medal of st christopher the patron saint of car drivers nwith the weather blessing one prays explicitly for protection against hail lightning and drought n xe2 x80 xa6 nto bless always means that something shall flourish because only then when there is a blessing upon a cause or a project will something good come out of it nthe blessing comes from god he is being addressed in the form of a request and it is given to people objects and buildings with the help of the sign of the cross holy water and incense n xe2 x80 xa6 nbut now concerning the question of cardinal marx and not a few of the priests the answer is simple one may ask for god blessing for sinners but not for the sin nthat is to say one could not consecrate a brothel one could not bless a concentration camp or weapons which are not explicitly ordained for hunting or for legitimate selfdefense ntherefore it is clear that one may not bless a relationship which is sinful one may not bless the mafia no blessing for organizations or institutions which promote or procure abortions or which propagate ideologies which are against the faith antisemitic contents or other forms of racist thought nif one considers and weighs this matter one knows one may not bless a union of two homosexual men or of lesbian women nof course one could bless two men or women who are de facto homosexual and that it what happens in each holy mass which is being attended by them nthis blessing xe2 x80 x93 which is not related to their acts xe2 x80 x93 is being received also by all the other sinners and the church thereby hopes that they will convert under the influence of god grace nthis position which is really simple and easily to be understood has been clearly and convincingly presented xe2 x80 x93 since the statement of the two bishops marx and bode xe2 x80 x93 by several christians by archbishops ludwig schick germany and charles chaput usa by the germanspeaking theologians hubert windisch and markus b xc3 xbcning ni am sure there are many many others too who think alike but whom i do not know ndear cardinal marx and dear bishop bode there is only one catholic answer no nand your addition xe2 x80 x9cin individual cases xe2 x80 x9d is absolutely worthless it has no argumentative force nwhat would st john the baptist have said if herod taking for himself his brother wife would have excusingly called himself an xe2 x80 x9cindividual case xe2 x80 x9d nthe idea to bless sinful conduct is really what isaiah described quite vividly as follows xe2 x80 x9cwoe to you that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter xe2 x80 x9d isaiah 520 nis this not exactly what cardinal marx xe2 x80 x93 and others who are thinking like him xe2 x80 x93 are doing nif one were to place on a bottle of sour cucumbers a tag xe2 x80 x9choney xe2 x80 x9d the cucumbers still remain sour neven blessing bishops cannot change that nnor can the pope in calling for a cultural revolution especially since he does not explain what he exactly means by it nhe says that he xe2 x80 x9callows himself xe2 x80 x9d to talk like that xe2 x80 x93 but if one dares something one might win but one also can perish nthat seems to catch on these days nfor example the italian moral theologian maurizio chiodi recently claimed in his talk at the gregorian pontifical university that contraception is sometimes not only not forbidden but even demanded nto contradict two popes xe2 x80 x93 whom the church has already xe2 x80 x9cbeatified xe2 x80 x9d the one and xe2 x80 x9ccanonized xe2 x80 x9d the other xe2 x80 x93 so shortly after their deaths and in such a radical and open manner probably has never happened before in the church history nisaiah says that such people draw unto them god punishment with thick cords nnevertheless one should wish for cardinal marx bishop bode and professor chiodi that they sleep well nwhether their conscience will allow it is not so certain but if it does not allow it it would

158,pope francis  sexual abuse commission hit by resignations and criticism gets a reboot n nlast week pope francis announced he was reviving a panel he created to advise the vatican on how to handle sexual abuse by clergy nthe issue has dogged the roman catholic church in recent years and critics have accused francis and his two predecessors john paul ii and benedict xvi of failing to aggressively weed out and punish predator priests nhere xe2 x80 x99s a look what drove the panel xe2 x80 x99s creation and what to expect in the future nwhat is pope francis xe2 x80 x99 commission on sexual abuse nfollowing criticism he was not focusing on halting child abuse within the church francis created the pontifical commission for the protection of minors in march 2014 naming cardinal sean o xe2 x80 x99malley the archbishop of boston to run it no xe2 x80 x99malley was not only a member of the pope xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9cg9 xe2 x80 x9d group of close advisors he was also the man who sought to clean up the abuse scandal in boston after the departure of his predecessor cardinal bernard law whose shifting of predator priests to new posts was exposed by the boston globe and chronicled in the movie xe2 x80 x9cspotlight xe2 x80 x9d nthe revelations about law who died in december emboldened abuse victims across the country and world who began speaking up about the priests who had molested them nwhen he created the commission francis said xe2 x80 x9cthe commission xe2 x80 x99s specific task is to propose to me the most opportune initiatives for protecting minors and vulnerable adults in order that we may do everything possible to ensure that crimes such as those which have occurred are no longer repeated in the church xe2 x80 x9d nwhy is it being renewed now nafter the commission xe2 x80 x99s threeyear mandate expired in december francis relaunched it on feb 17 with some members reappointed and nine new members added some of whom are victims of abuse although the vatican declined to say which opting to respect their privacy no xe2 x80 x99malley returns as chief nnew members come from australia brazil ethiopia india the netherlands and tonga reflecting the global reach of the church and the challenge of creating safeguarding structures in diverse cultural context xe2 x80 x9d the vatican said nwhat did the first commission achieve nthe vatican has said it xe2 x80 x9cworked with almost 200 dioceses and religious communities worldwide to raise awareness and to educate people on the need for safeguarding in our homes parishes schools hospitals and other institutions xe2 x80 x9d nwhat didn xe2 x80 x99t it do ncommission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness and deal with the bishops who quietly shift offenders to new dioceses when they are exposed as molesters and rapists neven if church laws already existed to hold bishops accountable for their priests xe2 x80 x99 behavior those strictures were not enough o xe2 x80 x99malley said in 2014 n xe2 x80 x9cthere are theoretically i guess canons that could apply here but obviously they have not been sufficient xe2 x80 x9d he said nthe commission was behind francis xe2 x80 x99 decision in 2015 to create a new tribunal to judge bishops caught covering up for abusive priests and to fund it for five years nbut amid myriad legal questions over what exact powers the court would have it never got off the ground nin 2016 francis officially killed the plan to create it issuing a document that essentially called on using existing procedures to tackle the problem nfrancis was also criticized when australian cardinal george pell whom he had brought to rome to clean up vatican finances was forced to return to australia last year to face charges of sexual assault nany other problems ncommission members said bishops should call the police when they discovered predator priests rather than phone the nearest religious retreat to xe2 x80 x9cpark xe2 x80 x9d the priest out of harm xe2 x80 x99s way nbut this simple message was hard to get across nit emerged that during a vatican training course for new bishops in september 2015 a french priest informed bishops they had no obligation to report abuse to the police forcing the commission to issue a strong statement saying bishops had every obligation to do so ndid commission members persevere nnot all of them nbritish member peter saunders a former victim of priestly abuse was ousted in 2016 nhe said the group was a toothless papershuffling exercise nirish member marie collins another victim resigned in march last year and said vatican bureaucrats had refused to comply with the commission xe2 x80 x99s request xe2 x80 x94 approved by the pope xe2 x80 x94 to respond to all letters sent to the vatican by abuse victims nmarie collins then a member of the pope  sex abuse commission in 2015 hands a letter to cardinal sean o malley detailing the abuse suffered by juan carlos cruz of chile ncatherine bonnet  associated press nwas the pope listening to the commission npossibly not nin 2015 collins handed o xe2 x80 x99malley a letter addressed to the pope from juan carlos cruz a chilean abused as a boy by chilean prelate fernando karadima who was sentenced by the vatican to a lifetime of penance in 2010 ncruz described how the abuse was witnessed and covered up by juan barros a priest whose appointment as a bishop in 2015 prompted huge protests in chile nthe pope has stuck by barros dismissing the protesters as xe2 x80 x9clefties xe2 x80 x9d and hugging barros publicly during his visit to chile last month ni can t condemn barros because i don t have evidence he said on the plane back to rome suggesting he had ignored or never read the letter from cruz nthat was too much for o xe2 x80 x99malley who said francis had caused great pain xe2 x80 x9d to victims nif francis was not listening to the commission about barros whom was he listening to nvatican watchers believe the pope was influenced by chilean cardinal francisco javier errazuriz a member of the g9 group who has backed barros and reportedly helped block moves to make cruz a member of the abuse commission nso is the pope intransigent on barros nno nsomething changed his mind after his chilean trip possibly the scale of the protest against barros in the country non feb 17 he sent a senior vatican sex abuse investigator archbishop charles scicluna to new york to interview cruz who now lives in philadelphia nfor the first time i felt that someone is listening cruz said after the meeting nwhat happens next n xe2 x80 x9cthis should lead to barros stepping down xe2 x80 x9d said saunders who is forming his own campaign group with cruz and others to fight clerical abuse nthe new

nso the fellow was violating no gun laws whatsoever nplus he never removed the pistol from its holster or brandished it in any way nsecondly the man was xe2 x80 x9cknown xe2 x80 x9d to nearby bars and restaurants near his place of residence nthat means nothing nknown for what nthe report doesn xe2 x80 x99t even say the man was known for acting weirdly or strangely nit just says he was xe2 x80 x9cknown xe2 x80 x9d and even if he did act weirdly or strangely if we denied constitutional rights to everyone in that category a majority of americans would have no rights and all of congress would

people happens all of the time nplus if complaints had been received over the course of an entire year and police just now decided to act the man must not have been considered much of a threat

nno specifics except to say he was xe2 x80 x9cstaring xe2 x80 x9d at people nwow nrun for your lives nfifthly a us citizen who has committed no crime is denied his natural right of selfdefense for a

indefinitely nhow many defenseless unarmed people are robbed assaulted accosted beaten up raped wounded paralyzed or killed in a year xe2 x80 x99s time nit seems many politicians and many police officers themselves will not be content until every american citizen is totally defenseless and unable to protect him or herself ni tell you this with all seriousness at some point the american people

so because he said he didn xe2 x80 x99t like the sight of the man carrying a firearm as it made him xe2 x80 x9cafraid xe2 x80 x9d nso what nthat the mere sight of a lawabiding citizen openly carrying a sidearm would make someone xe2 x80 x9cafraid xe2 x80 x9d is not sufficient reason to deny the citizen his constitutional right to keep and xe2 x80 x9cbear xe2 x80 x9d arms nthis xe2 x80 x9ci xe2 x80

xe2 x80 x9cred flag xe2 x80 x9d law in washington state police are now able to confiscate a person xe2 x80 x99s firearm without the person committing any crime xe2 x80 x94or even threatening to commit a crime neven when police forced the man to surrender his firearm the man made no threatening gesture toward the officers ngun confiscation has started in america xe2 x80 x94and president trump xe2 x80 x99s stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later is the banner under which this is happening nwhen trump promised to add xe2 x80 x9cmental health xe2 x80 x9d regulations to gun purchases and ownership he opened pandora xe2 x80 x99s box ni go into the xe2 x80 x9cmental health xe2 x80 x9d trap in more detail in this column ntrump set to enact more gun control n xe2 x80 x9cmental health xe2 x80 x9d regulations for gun ownership is what extremist gun grabbers schumer pelosi feinstein et al have been trying to accomplish for decades nnow it is the xe2 x80 x9cprogun xe2 x80 x9d republican president donald trump who is the one making it happen nkris kobach is the secretary of state of kansas nhe is a former professor of constitutional law at umkc law school nhe wrote an excellent analysis of the constitutional violations of these xe2 x80 x9cred flag xe2 x80 x9d laws nthe seizure of guns without any hearing at all nthe laws all contain an xe2 x80 x9cex parte xe2 x80 x9d provision that allows the state to temporarily seize a person xe2 x80 x99s guns without even notifying the gun owner or giving him a chance to be heard nthis is the quintessential denial of due process nthe fourth amendment makes clear that a person cannot be denied of liberty to exercise one xe2 x80 x99s constitutional right to bear arms without due process of law nthis confiscation is xe2 x80 x9ctemporary xe2 x80 x9d but it can easily lead to longterm or permanent confiscation nbased on the testimony of one unrelated person nthe confiscation order can be based on the testimony of only one person claiming that the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others nthe law deceptively says that it has to be the testimony of a xe2 x80 x9cfamily member xe2 x80 x9d most of the xe2 x80 x9cred flag xe2 x80 x9d laws such as the one in washington state do not limit who can claim the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others to family members nbut xe2 x80 x9cfamily member xe2 x80 x9d is defined to include xe2 x80 x9cformer dating partners xe2 x80 x9d and anyone who has ever lived with the defendant nso a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend or even a roommate from years ago could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner nusing a very low standard of proof nthe standard for obtaining an ex parte order against a gun owner is absurdly low xe2 x80 x93 one need only show xe2 x80 x9creasonable cause xe2 x80 x9d to believe that the person may pose a risk nthat xe2 x80 x99s even lower than the xe2

is in place it becomes very difficult to remove nto have the confiscation order lifted the gun owner must provehe does not pose a threat to himself or others nproving a negative is nearly impossible nadding insult to injury the bill even authorizes local law enforcement to charge the gun owner a storage fee for confiscating and storing his guns nafter the parkland school shooting had donald trump simply used his bully pulpit to promote arming teachers and school employees as a deterrent and defense against these school shootings without calling for more gun control it would have been a huge boost for the second amendment in general and school safety in particular ninstead trump fell in with antisecond amendment liberals and started calling for more gun control adding xe2 x80 x9cmental health xe2 x80 x9d restrictions to gun purchases and making his stupid stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later nas a result antigun liberals all over the country are using trump xe2 x80 x99s own words and proposed gun control policies as a rallying cry to enact gun confiscation laws nas it stands right now donald trump has opened the door for more damage being done to the second amendment than any other president democrat or republican in our lifetime nfreedomists in the 50 states had better keep a close eye on their state legislatures this year and next because thanks to donald trump gun confiscation is going to be on the agenda in virtually every single state in the country nand while you are at it don xe2 x80 x99t overlook the federal congress nno wonder dianne feinstein looked so deliriously and devilishly happy when trump uttered his stupid comment about gun confiscation and said he wanted to bring an assault weapons ban feinstein xe2 x80 x99s bill into proposed gun control legislation nsee the video here nwatch dianne feinstein erupt with glee after trump seems to endorse her assault weapons ban nbut if you are a freedomloving american who values your liberties and the godgiven right to defend them happy is not what you should be feeling right now nyou should be outraged at donald trump and you should be absolutely determined to be ever vigilant against any attempt from democrats or republicans from federal state or municipal government to enact further restrictions against your right to keep and bear arms xe2 x80 x94because trump has opened the door not only for more gun control but also for gun confiscation nps none more time i want to remind readers that selfdefense xe2 x80 x94including defense against tyrannical government xe2 x80 x94is more than a right guaranteed in the second amendment to our constitution it is a duty assigned us in nature by our creator nfor anyone especially a christian to willingly surrender their means of selfdefense is not only a crime against liberty it is a sin against god ni urge my christian friends and anyone else to read the book my constitutional attorney son and i wrote entitled xe2 x80 x9cto keep or not to keep why christians should not give up their guns xe2 x80 x9d nmark it down any law demanding the citizenry to surrender their ar15 rifles would be unconstitutional unnatural and unbiblical nand no christian or other free man should ever comply with such a law ni know that there is a plethora of pastors who teach that christians ought to obey the government should it outlaw our guns nthey are wrong nthey are wrong biblically constitutionally and morally nour book shows the natural and biblical duty of selfdefense ni don xe2 x80 x99t know of another book like it nwith all that is happening today it is crucial that people especially christians become familiar with the truths contained in this book ni urge you to order one

172,et tu benedict nsome final thoughts on joseph ratzinger n nrecently an editor of a xe2 x80 x9cconservative xe2 x80 x9d catholic magazine asked me if i would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of pope benedict xvi five years on ni declined telling him that i was morally certain that anything i had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies nit xe2 x80 x99s been five years and i xe2 x80 x99ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a xe2 x80 x9ccourageous xe2 x80 x9d act it was to give up the pontificate nthe consequences of that act have been so outlandish xe2 x80 x93 even for people who are mostly ok with francis xe2 x80 x93 that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it neditor note in a march 11th letter signed by pope emeritus benedict xvi and addressed to msgr ndario vigano prefect of the secretariat for communications the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of pope francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation nin no uncertain terms this letter bearing benedict signature affirms that xe2 x80 x9cthere is an internal continuity between the two pontificates xe2 x80 x9d whether benedict actually wrote this letter or not it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica nour thanks to remnant columnist hilary white for addressing the most pertinent of these here below nmjm nin fact five years after the resignation of pope benedict the catholic faithful mostly want to know why why would a pope xe2 x80 x93 a man with decades of upcloseandpersonal experience of the xe2 x80 x9cfilth xe2 x80 x9d in the curia and throughout the church xe2 x80 x93 suddenly just decide to quit nwhy would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed nat the time and since then particularly in light of what has been happening it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial so inappropriately so disproportionately petty nthese absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did nwe cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before ncould we have been wrong about him nand if so could we have been this wrong nfor reasons all we heard at the time was essentially xe2 x80 x9ci xe2 x80 x99m tired xe2 x80 x9d there was some implication that he didn xe2 x80 x99t feel up to international travel anymore so couldn xe2 x80 x99t make it to world youth day and similar events nthe trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the popeaspopstar something we had thought benedict was too serious a man too serious a catholic to believe himself nof all people we had assumed that benedict xvi took the papacy seriously nand since then as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the newchurch mud are busily hatching out many catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him nthis man whom we had believed a xe2 x80 x9cchampion of orthodoxy xe2 x80 x9d whom we thought we knew nerror even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor who has literally turned the vatican into a den of thieves and we hear nothing but the occasional carefully worded statement on how fine everything is nhow content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life nafter three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant ratzinger addressed to francis xe2 x80 x9cyour goodness is my home and the place where i feel safe xe2 x80 x9d everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel but the video doesn xe2 x80 x99t lie nso strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion not free to speak his mind nbut this is not what we see nthere he is manifestly happy and reading it out loud n xe2 x80 x9cperhaps it was written for him xe2 x80 x9d well why repeat it then nwhy if he has any qualms allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions to read this blatant propaganda nif it is a deception why participate in it nin fact all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they xe2 x80 x9cmiss xe2 x80 x9d him have failed to respect him in one way they won xe2 x80 x99t take him at his word nsome insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn xe2 x80 x99t valid nbut we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint that he had resigned freely nand indeed far from being an isolated xe2 x80 x9cprisoner of the vatican xe2 x80 x9d benedict has received many guests all of whom report that though frail he appears content and never utters a word of criticism nwe have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat nthere xe2 x80 x99s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation something doesn xe2 x80 x99t add up it xe2 x80 x99s true nall the questions have gone ignored or have received frivolous jokey responses nwhy did you resign nratzinger xe2 x80 x9ci was a bit tired and didn xe2 x80 x99t feel up to partying with the kids at world youth day xe2 x80 x9d nif you xe2 x80 x99re not pope why do you still wear the white nratzinger xe2 x80 x9coh there wasn xe2 x80 x99t a black cassock that fit me xe2 x80 x9d nwhy do you continue to call yourself benedict xvi if you are no longer pope nratzinger xe2 x80 x9cwell i xe2 x80 x99m an xe2 x80 x98emeritus xe2 x80 x99 you see xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d nand where did this xe2 x80 x9cemeritus xe2 x80 x9d business come from ndoes it have any precedent in catholic history nwhat does it mean canonically and doctrinally nratzinger xe2 x80 x9c xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d nwhat was all that rubbish from ganswein about there being a divided xe2 x80 x9cmunus xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x93 with an active member and a xe2 x80 x9ccontemplative member xe2 x80 x9d ndoesn xe2 x80 x99t that just mean there are two popes now nratzinger xe2 x80 x9c xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d nand perhaps most agonising of all xe2 x80 x9chow can you just sit there smiling issuing bland platitudinous nonsense while this lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff xe2 x80 x9d na few days ago my friend steve skojec of the traditionalistrestorationist website one peter five summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for the man we used to call pope benedict nsteve summons up in this brief post all the anger and all the crushing disappointment most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud nfive years ago today pope benedict xvi abdicated the papacy nand through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the church he made way for the worst papacy of all time xe2 x80 x93 one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word deed or even the subtlest gesture nyou may love him for various reasons you may miss him by contrast but you may not excuse the responsibility he has nhe walked away from his family leaving the door open to an abusive stepfather and he watches his children beaten and led astray not just in silence but in apparent contentment nand still he was the best of the postconciliar popes which is why he xe2 x80 x99s the only one who won xe2 x80 x99t be canonized nwho is the real joseph ratzinger ni have had longtime vatican watchers say to me more than once xe2 x80 x9cmaybe it xe2 x80 x99s really just that he wasn xe2 x80 x99t who we thought he was xe2 x80 x9d i suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine ni think we made the mistake of believing the press nwe were delighted that the bitterly anticatholic media hated and feared him nwe failed to recall that they know nothing at all about catholicism nwhat the papers never told us was that as a young priest and theologian joseph ratzinger was known as a xe2 x80 x9cprogressive xe2 x80 x9d as the term was understood in 1962 nthis reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus the theological advisor of one of the council xe2 x80 x99s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp cardinal josef frings of cologne nfrings xe2 x80 x99 claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the cdf xe2 x80 x93 and its prefect cardinal alfredo ottaviani xe2 x80 x93 for the xe2 x80 x9cconservatism xe2 x80 x9d in the xe2 x80 x9cschema xe2 x80 x9d the documents prepared by the cdf for guiding the bishops xe2 x80 x99 discussions nafter this speech there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema xe2 x80 x93 that had taken years to develop xe2 x80 x93 be abandoned nthis was done over ottaviani xe2 x80 x99s futile objections and new documents were rapidly cobbled together by a coalition of german and french xe2 x80 x9cprogressives xe2 x80 x9d who rejoiced that they had in effect seized control of the council from that moment before it had even started nit has since been revealed that it was joseph ratzinger xe2 x80 x93 the maverick xe2 x80 x9cprogressive xe2 x80 x9d academic theologian frings had brought to rome as his secretary xe2 x80 x93 who wrote that speech ncardinal henri de lubac writing in 1985 recalling that drama said n xe2 x80 x9cjoseph ratzinger an expert at the council was also the private secretary of card nfrings archbishop of cologne nblind the old cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions nnow then one of these interventions became memorable it was a radical criticism of the methods of the holy office ndespite a reply by card nottaviani frings sustained his critique n n xe2 x80 x9cit is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old holy office as it presented itself then was destroyed by ratzinger in union with his archbishop n n xe2 x80 x9ccard nseper a man full of goodness intiated the renovation nratzinger who did not change continues it xe2 x80 x9d nratzinger xe2 x80 x99s reputation as a xe2 x80 x9cprogressive xe2 x80 x9d is not based on one incident nor was it restricted to his early work nit went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of cdf that he had written in 1982 a call for the church xe2 x80 x9cnever to return xe2 x80 x9d to the syllabus of errors of pius ix nin his book principles of catholic theology ratzinger proposed the question xe2 x80 x9cshould the council be revoked xe2 x80 x9d and in response recommended the xe2 x80 x9crazing of the bastions xe2 x80 x9d of the catholic church in relation to the modern world nthe duty is therefore not to suppress the council but to discover the real council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then n nthis implies that there is no possible return to the syllabus which could well have been a first step in the combat against liberalism and the nascent marxism but which cannot be the last word nneither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of relations with the modern world for the christian nhence the razing of the bastions that hans urs von balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty nit was necessary for her the church to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith the power of the word that is her unique true and permanent strength nbut to raze the bastions cannot signify that she no longer has anything to protect or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified lord nhis was the thesis xe2 x80 x93 a mainstay of xe2 x80 x9cconservative xe2 x80 x9d ideology xe2 x80 x93 that the xe2 x80 x9creal xe2 x80 x9d council if only implemented properly would be the salvation of the church and the world a theme he never left nhow ironic it must have seemed to those who remembered this history that ratzinger would himself be given the office he had xe2 x80 x9cdestroyed xe2 x80 x9d and would gain the mediagenerated reputation as an xe2 x80 x9carchconservative xe2 x80 x9d nand it starts to suggest an answer or at least a line of inquiry about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure nwith the xe2 x80 x9carchconservative xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9crottweiler xe2 x80 x9d ratzinger in cdf why do we have the situation we have today nwhat did he do to stop the explosion of neomodernism xe2 x80 x93 that burned like an unchecked wildfire throughout the catholic world through the reign of john paul ii nwhat did xe2 x80 x9csilencing xe2 x80 x9d by ratzinger xe2 x80 x99s cdf do to stop hans kung becoming a celebrity xe2 x80 x9cpriesttheologian xe2 x80 x9d courted by the media for his loathing of catholicism nkung who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy ncan we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree nprecious few nbut we can certainly think of many many who spent their lives and vocations blatantly denying and undermining the catholic faith xe2 x80 x93 academic theologians religious priests bishops and cardinals around the world xe2 x80 x93 with never a peep of protest from rome nmoreover the scandalous pack of frauds we currently have in the episcopate is entirely the product of the xe2 x80 x9carchconservative xe2 x80 x9d john paul ii and the xe2 x80 x9crottweiler xe2 x80 x9d benedict xvi pontificates nwhy did we think that ratzinger in this crucial role of cdf prefect was a bulwark of orthodoxy nis it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the faith ourselves to make a comparison to make an objective judgement nthe xe2 x80 x9cprogressive xe2 x80 x9d destroyer of ottaviani inheriting his office and the epithet xe2 x80 x9carchconservative xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 xa6 nindeed ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions nhe was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like kung and kasper who had moved further to the ideological xe2 x80 x9cleft xe2 x80 x9d after the 1960s while he stayed in place nperhaps now as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces we can finally accept his word on this nperhaps the world of catholic academic theology had become so corrupted that a man called xe2 x80 x9cprogressive xe2 x80 x9d in 1963 but whose ideas remained the same would look like a xe2 x80 x9cchampion of traditional catholic orthodoxy xe2 x80 x9d by 2005 nis this why he resigned nis it simply that his conception of the church of the papacy was never what catholics believed about it nperhaps a hint at the answer comes from la stampa in 2015 which published some of the memoirs of silvano fausti sj who had been confessor and spiritual guide of cardinal carlo maria martini the godfather of the xe2 x80 x9cliberal xe2 x80 x9d european catholic church and alleged leader of the xe2 x80 x9csankt gallen mafia xe2 x80 x9d that cardinal danneels admitted conspired for years against pope benedict nfausti said that benedict met with martini at the bishops xe2 x80 x99 palace of milan in june 2012 nmartini fausti said urged benedict to resign the papacy napparently at the time of his election in 2005 martini had said it would be his main task to reform the curia nby 2012 this had proved impossible nwhy would benedict take advice from a man like martini xe2 x80 x93 the xe2 x80 x9cgodfather xe2 x80 x9d of the xe2 x80 x9cliberal wing xe2 x80 x9d of european catholicism ni think the question would not even occur to a man like ratzinger nthey were esteemed academic colleagues nthey were brothers of the episcopate nthey were members of the club nany appearance of ideological division between them was in essence a product of the media narrative nwhy wouldn xe2 x80 x99t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal nwhy is walter kasper a cardinal none of the most prominent of those puzzle pieces is the apparent inability of these xe2 x80 x9cconservative xe2 x80 x9d prelates to detect let alone effectively oppose these brazen enemies of the faith within the episcopate and college of cardinals nit beggars belief of ordinary people that after so many years of hearing and reading them ratzinger would remain on such friendly terms with men like walter kasper and carlo maria martini the alleged brains of the sankt gallen mafia nwhen at his very first angelus address in 2013 pope francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of walter kasper quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope njorge bergoglio might have been unknown to the larger catholic world but walter kasper was a celebrity heretic the mediasavvy frontman for the xe2 x80 x9cultraliberal xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cwing xe2 x80 x9d of the postvatican ii church nin an article on the cardinal xe2 x80 x99s life xe2 x80 x99s work thomas jansen the editorinchief of katholischde recently noted that walter kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both john paul ii and pope benedict nthe monstrous debacle of amoris laetitia is as much kasper xe2 x80 x99s work as bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s nthis is a man who has for 40 years never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome njansen points out that kasper had already tried to bring out the same proposal for communion for divorced and remarried in 1993 together with karl lehmann another xe2 x80 x9csankt gallen xe2 x80 x9d member nthis was stopped by ratzinger and the cdf nbut that raises the next question if ratzinger knew so well what kind of creature kasper was why wasn xe2 x80 x99t the next step to pitch him out of the episcopate on his ear nwhy was he not xe2 x80 x93 at the very least xe2 x80 x93 given the same xe2 x80 x9csilencing xe2 x80 x9d treatment as kung nkasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic nbut it xe2 x80 x99s a simple truth he xe2 x80 x99s a heretic neveryone knows he xe2 x80 x99s a heretic because we have heard him trumpeting in his blatant heresies from every rooftop he could find for decades nafter openly working against the faith instead of being demoted silenced laicised andor excommunicated john paul ii made him a cardinal nremember that his scheme to amorislatitiaize the church was stopped by ratzinger xe2 x80 x99s cdf in 1993 nbut he was not demoted reprimanded or corrected in any way nnor was he removed from places of influence nfar from it nin 1994 kasper was inserted into the vatican curia by being named cochair of the international commission for lutherancatholic dialogue nin 1999 he made another step up being appointed secretary of the pontifical council for promoting christian unity the xe2 x80 x9cecumenical xe2 x80 x9d office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign nin 2001 he was made a cardinaldeacon with the awesome responsibility of voting in a conclave nthen benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal nand as if to add a finishing touch to the poisoned cake that is ratzinger xe2 x80 x99s involvement in the creation of the new catholic paradigm benedict is now being said to have deliberately timed his resignation in order to allow his old academic colleague to participate in the 2013 conclave nas jansen pointed out and maike hickson quoted in a piece for one peter five ncardinal kasper barely even made it into the last conclave because he had just turned 80 years of age nbut since the date of the death or abdication as it was the case in 2013 of the pope is decisive he was still able to attend and vote in that election nas some observers noted it was a generous gesture toward cardinal kasper that pope benedict xvi had decided to retire in due time nexcuse me maike but i don xe2 x80 x99t think this is a parenthetical issue nis it any wonder that so many catholics have become disaffected ncardinal ratzinger pope xe2 x80 x9cemeritus xe2 x80 x9d benedict xe2 x80 x93 whatever you want to call yourself xe2 x80 x93 i have one question that i would really like you to answer why is this man still a cardinal nwhy is he still a bishop nwhy is he still allowed to call himself a xe2 x80 x9ccatholic theologian xe2 x80 x9d nwhy did you apparently deliberately ensure that he was able to enter the conclave to decide who your successor was going to be ndoesn xe2 x80 x99t anyone else want to know this ndon xe2 x80 x99t we all want to know why hans kung is still a priest nwhy was cardinal mahony allowed to retire in good standing nwhy a man like weakland the active homosexual who paid off his exlover was not excommunicated nwhat are the names we all remember just off the top of our heads nmy own bishop in victoria the occultist remi de roo seattle xe2 x80 x99s raymond hunthausen miami xe2 x80 x99s favalora rochester xe2 x80 x99s matthew clark derek worlock of liverpool xe2 x80 xa6 i sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over nfor fifty years catholics have wanted to know why nothing was ever done as these wolves in the episcopate were allowed year after year to continue attacking the church nwhy have we so often seen these men xe2 x80 x93 compromised intellectually and morally xe2 x80 x93 elevated to superior rank despite the incredible brazenness of their hatred of the catholic faith nthe end of xe2 x80 x9cbig umbrella catholicism xe2 x80 x9d nthe new york times xe2 x80 x99 ross douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions nmaike hickson quotes him writing of this bizarre situation xe2 x80 x93 in which each of the socalled xe2 x80 x9csankt gallen mafia xe2 x80 x9d prelates including kasper who openly campaigned for the effective abolition of catholic moral teaching xe2 x80 x9cit was characteristic of the church xe2 x80 x99s effective truce between conservatives and progressivists that john paul ii himself had given most of them their red hats elevating them despite their disagreement with his restorationist approach xe2 x80 x9d nwhen journalists talk about catholicism they often speak of a man like kasper being xe2 x80 x93 as his wikipedia page puts it xe2 x80 x93 xe2 x80 x9cone of the main figures of the liberal wing of the catholic church xe2 x80 x9d and this is supposed to make some kind of sense to catholics we xe2 x80 x99re supposed to accept it as the reality of our times nthere xe2 x80 x99s a xe2 x80 x9cliberal wing xe2 x80 x9d and a xe2 x80 x9cconservative wing xe2 x80 x9d and they xe2 x80 x99re both catholic nsteve skojec told me that our willingness to go along with the whole xe2 x80 x9cemeritus pope xe2 x80 x9d charade was an error xe2 x80 x9ci think the problem is that we all went along with their game of make believe and we shouldn xe2 x80 x99t have xe2 x80 x9d in fact i am starting to think that the willingness of most catholics to go along with the entire charade of postconciliar catholicism has been a grave error nby playing along by pretending that we could be xe2 x80 x9cconservative catholics xe2 x80 x9d in this new paradigm that also includes xe2 x80 x9cliberal catholics xe2 x80 x9d we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history nbecause of this schizophrenic mindset of the church xe2 x80 x99s leadership since 1965 we have all come to accept the underlying premise that the church is a xe2 x80 x9cbig umbrella xe2 x80 x9d with plenty of room for people of all personal opinions that such issues as liturgy are matters of personal xe2 x80 x9ctaste xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 xa6that two opposed things can both be catholic truth nthis schizophrenia is the model under which xe2 x80 x9cconservatives xe2 x80 x9d have operated all this time and by which they have judged a man like joseph ratzinger to be a xe2 x80 x9cconservative champion of orthodoxy xe2 x80 x9d and what has this achieved nit created cover for the men of kasper xe2 x80 x99s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of peter five years ago nand just like that the jargon of xe2 x80 x9ctolerance xe2 x80 x9d and the xe2 x80 x9cbig umbrella xe2 x80 x9d is over and the purge of faithful believing catholic religious seminarians priests and academics has begun nas it had to nthey at least do not harbour this insane contradiction and understand xe2 x80 x93 and frequently say out loud xe2 x80 x93 that the new paradigm and the catholic church are not the same nand their new church is the only one left nfor five decades we played the anglican game as long as we don xe2 x80 x99t talk about it there isn xe2 x80 x99t a problem nottaviani xe2 x80 x99s holy office and schema were the last gasp of the old church xe2 x80 x93 and as de lubac said above it was killed by joseph ratzinger nwe had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed while the institution around them fell to the new paradigm until the papacy was the only thing left none of the things i xe2 x80 x99ve been saying is a blessing in disguise and an enormous relief about the bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the wojtylaratzinger era nwe were expected for all those years to pretend we were in the xe2 x80 x9cnew springtime of vatican ii xe2 x80 x9d while we watched these wolves in shepherds xe2 x80 x99 clothing eating the sheep nnow we can at least finally stop pretending that everything is just dandy under the new paradigm of merciful conciliar wonderfulness nfor those still wondering bergoglio isn xe2 x80 x99t a shock he isn xe2 x80 x99t even a surprise he xe2 x80 x99s just the logical end result nthis pontificate isn xe2 x80 x99t an anomaly it was the only possible outcome and it was as much the work of joseph ratzinger as walter kasper

a speech at the grand gathering of iranians for free iran n xe2 x80 x9cthere is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs and that opposition is centered in this room today ni had said for over 10 years since coming to these events that the declared policy of the united states of america should be the overthrow of the mullahs xe2 x80 x99 regime in tehran nthe behavior and the objectives

despite the neocon attempts to rewrite history mek have killed americans and committed multiple acts of terrorism nfor decades and based on us intelligence the united states government has blamed the

191,here we go again  leaked documents white house planning regime change in iran n ndon t say you were not warned america napparently the us didn t learn from its first dealings in regime change decades ago and is now prepared to give it another shot according to leaked documents ndon t get me wrong here ni m not for the government of iran ni despise islam and i despise the ideology of muhammad and his devout followers noverall the people of iran are probably some decent people but those in leadership have issues but that is something for the people there to deal with niran is not an actual threat to the united states nhowever the us seems hellbent on continuing to put its nose into other countries politics including seeking to change its government while hypocritically pointing at other countries for trying to manipulate our own political system ntake our poll  story continues below nwhom do you consider to be the most corrupt democrat politician nwhom do you

nyou may opt out at anytime nyou also agree to this site  privacy policy and terms of use nthe washington free beacon reports nthe trump administration is examining a new plan to help iranians fighting the hardline regime in iran following america  exit from the landmark nuclear deal and reimposition of harsh economic sanctions that could topple a regime already beset by protests and a crashing economy according to a copy of the plan obtained by the washington free beacon nthe threepage white paper being circulated among national security council officials in the white house offers a strategy by which the trump administration can actively work to assist an already aggravated iranian public topple the hardline ruling regime through a democratization strategy that focuses on driving a deeper wedge between the iranian people and the ruling regime nthe plan authored by the security studies group or ssg a national security thinktank that has close ties to senior white house national security officials including national security adviser john bolton seeks to reshape longstanding american foreign policy toward iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change something the obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped iran in 2009 nthe regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift us policy towards iran and has found a receptive audience in the trump administration which has been moving in this direction since bolton xe2 x80 x94a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change xe2 x80 x94entered the white house nah yes john bolton nwhile i applaud bolton for his willingness to call islamic jihadis just that i am not so naive as to consider that his membership in the council on foreign relations has no effect in this decision nthe ordinary people of iran are suffering under economic stagnation while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the mullahs and the irgc command ssg writes in the paper nthis has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months nwell why is that nit  due to sanctions imposed by the likes of the us nas has been pointed out before sanctions hurt the people not the governments that lead them and then those same governments use the effects to propagandize the people against those who are ordering the sanctions ni m not saying the iranian government is good but it is iran  government nhonestly i see a ton of corruption and warmongering in our own government that rivals some of that of governments that america stands against nstill as was pointed out by matt agorist bolton told an audience of the grand gathering of iranians for free iran n xe2 x80 x9cthere is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs and that opposition is centered in this room today ni had said for over 10 years since coming to these events that the declared policy of the united states of america should be the overthrow of the mullahs xe2 x80 x99 regime in tehran nthe behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself nand that xe2 x80 x99s why before 2019 we here will celebrate in tehran xe2 x80 x9d nand again this really has nothing to do with the us none source close to the white house who has previewed the plan told the free beacon that the nuclear deal also known as the jcpoa solidified the iranian regime xe2 x80 x99s grip on power and intentionally prevented the united states from fomenting regime change n xe2 x80 x9cthe jcpoa purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the islamic republic xe2 x80 x9d said the source who would only speak to the free beacon on background about the sensitive issue n xe2 x80 x9cprior to that everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world xe2 x80 x99s largest state sponsor of terrorism nit xe2 x80 x99s now trump bolton and mike pompeo xe2 x80 x99s job to put this consensus back in place xe2 x80 x9d nthe source told the beacon that bolton is xe2 x80 x9cacutely aware of the danger the iranian regime poses to the region xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cjohn is someone who understands the danger of iran viscerally and knows that you xe2 x80 x99re never going to fundamentally change its behavior xe2 x80 x94and the threats against israel and the saudis especially xe2 x80 x94until that revolutionary regime is gone xe2 x80 x9d the source said adding that xe2 x80 x9cnothing xe2 x80 x99s off the table right now if israel is attacked xe2 x80 x9d nok i get they may pose a danger but let  look at the reality here nthose they pose a danger to namely saudi arabia and israel can both fend perfectly well for themselves and have demonstrated that ability to do it nthere is no need for the us to be involved in it in any way nwhy should we be fighting a battle or encouraging funding and i m quite sure arming a rebellion nwhere is that authorized in our constitution nsimple nit isn t ni care little for the saudi government as they help push sharia and is the land where many of the 911 hijackers came from nthe iranian government i care for even less but out of each of those which one should america have dealt with militarily following 911 nboth if you re going to go by information that we have a record on nwhy can t america focus on it  own issues and solve those nit  because we are too busy trying to police the world keeping the spotlight off of those in our government who are attacking our rights and spending us into more and more debt nand lest you think this is about the nuclear deal nit isn t n xe2 x80 x9cthe problem is not the iran nuclear deal it xe2 x80 x99s the iranian regime xe2 x80 x9d the source told the beacon n xe2 x80 x9cteam bolton has spent years creating plans b c and d for dealing with that problem npresident trump hired him knowing all of that nthe administration will now start aggressively moving to deal with the root cause of chaos and violence in the region in a cleareyed way xe2 x80 x9d nbolton says it will be accomplished in the next six months ni don t doubt it nthis will probably end up being another ukraine situation something we just don t need to be in and yes i know i ll be called a liberal but honest readers who have followed me for some time know that  not the case nnotice some things that are taking place in iran that the plan speaks about n xe2 x80 x9cmore than one third of iran xe2 x80 x99s population is minority groups many of whom already seek independence xe2 x80 x9d the paper explains n xe2 x80 x9cus nsupport for these independence movements both overt and covert could force the regime to focus attention on them and limit its ability to conduct other malign activities xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cthe probability the current iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low xe2 x80 x9d the plan states n xe2 x80 x9cabsent a change in government within iran america will face a choice between accepting a nucleararmed iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible xe2 x80 x9d npresident trump did made clear earlier in the week that we must make efforts to differentiate between the people of iran and its ruling regime nwell i agree but that gets real messy when you start intervening in this manner n xe2 x80 x9cany public discussion of these options and any messaging about the iranian regime in general should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace xe2 x80 x9d according to the plan n xe2 x80 x9cwe must constantly reinforce our support for removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people to allow them the freedom they deserve xe2 x80 x9d nbut the trump administration has spoken out on other countries where the people want their independence nremember the kurds nhow about the people in the catalan region of spain nno support for those people and why ncause it  not part of the agenda ni say if the iranian people want their freedom let them first free themselves from the bondage of islam and then let the passion that burns inside men to be free rise up as it did in our forefathers due to the teachings fo the holy scriptures and stand and fight nthen they will be in a position to ask for aid but only then n,"['appeal_to_authority', 'appeal_to_fear-prejudice', 'black-and-white_fallacy', 'repetition', 'loaded_language', 'flag-waving', 'name_calling', 'labeling']"

196,the islamization of the public schools n nmuslims anxious to use schools and textbooks to proselytize for islam have found a welcoming environment in american public schools that are indefatigably committed to multiculturalism nwith the imperative to be xe2 x80 x9ctolerant xe2 x80 x9d robbing many educators of their ability to evaluate nonwestern cultures critically all too many public schools and individual teachers have proven to be susceptible to an organized campaign by usbased islamic organizations and their primary benefactor saudi arabia to present a view of islam that whitewashes its violent history and intolerant doctrines nmany of the islamic groups that vet american public school textbooks for the accuracy of their material on islamic doctrine and history are saudifunded nthey make sure that the islamic instruction in these textbooks presents a picture of islam that is so pristine and whitewashed that it sometimes crosses the boundary from mere promuslim bias into outright islamic proselytizing nthe taboo about teaching religion in the public schools so zealously established and guarded against christian prayer by the aclu and the supreme court over the last few decades is increasingly set aside in american public schools as presentations on islam frequently cross the line between teaching facts about the religion and teaching the religion as fact ntake

201,pope francis vs contemplative orders n nthe francis vatican xe2 x80 x99s approach to the contemplative life is probably the most illustrative of our entire crisis ncontemplative life is aimed only at a purely supernatural end nit has no xe2 x80 x9cuse xe2 x80 x9d in the sense that either the bergoglians xe2 x80 x93 in terms of their political machinations xe2 x80 x93 or the world can understand nthere is probably no other place where the differences between the two programmes  the catholic programme of christ and the bergogliankasperian programme  are more sharply contrasted none aspect of pope francis xe2 x80 x99 character that seems littleexplored by the catholic and secular media alike is his apparent disdain for contemplative religious life xe2 x80 x93 a facet of catholic life that could be described as the most purely religious of all the church xe2 x80 x99s undertakings nthe world does not understand it or want it ntherefore it is something of a thorn in the bergoglian side and he has repeatedly expressed his contempt for it nso when in 2016 he issued a document on contemplative nuns the faithful braced for impact  nin his recent document ostensibly on holiness xe2 x80 x9cgaudete et exultate xe2 x80 x9d the pope attacked the religious desire for silence and solitude to be alone with god in prayer seeking unity with him saying in essence that the christian life is inherently about social activism about material worldly ends nto these foundations of the contemplative life xe2 x80 x93 indeed of any form of religious life in the church xe2 x80 x93 francis set up another of his false dichotomies contemplation in opposition to serving others giving a jesuit maxim as an imperative for all catholics xe2 x80 x9cwe are called to be contemplatives even in the midst of action and to grow in holiness by responsibly and generously carrying out our proper mission xe2 x80 x9d nitalian vaticanist marco tosatti commented dryly xe2 x80 x9crejoice and be glad xe2 x80 xa6 but not if you xe2 x80 x99re a cloistered contemplative xe2 x80 x9d nin 2016 i wrote that francis xe2 x80 x99 apostolic constitution xe2 x80 x9cvultum dei quaerere xe2 x80 x9d was in some respects the most damaging object of the wreckingball pontificate to date nunfortunately it was about a subject that the world and therefore the modern church cares so little about that hardly anyone noticed naimed specifically at female contemplative religious the document threatened that in a year or so another would be forthcoming laying out precisely what would now be required of nuns to continue in their vocations nthe new document issued last week xe2 x80 x9ccor orans xe2 x80 x9d is juridical that is it is not much more than a list of specific norms or rules xe2 x80 x93 289 of them n xe2 x80 x93 that all communities of contemplative nuns must now follow none odd remark in article 19 is maybe the most succinct description of the direction planned for contemplatives n xe2 x80 x9ca monastery of nuns as every religious house is erected while keeping in mind its usefulness for the church and for the institute xe2 x80 x9d emphasis added nwait xe2 x80 xa6 its xe2 x80 x9cusefulness xe2 x80 x9d ni think a fair question for the faithful to ask this vatican department might be xe2 x80 x9caccording to what specific criteria is a monastery xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x98usefulness xe2 x80 x99 actually determined xe2 x80 x9d none can xe2 x80 x99t help but hearken back to the criteria for monasteries that were allowed to survive the revolutionary purges in 18th and 19th century europe na house that could prove to the secularists that it was xe2 x80 x9cuseful xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x93 that it could care for the indigent elderly teach children or nurse the sick xe2 x80 x93 would be allowed to continue nthose which were purely contemplative xe2 x80 x93 a singleminded devotion to the adoration of god xe2 x80 x93 were closed nit is not an insignificant quirk of modern history and one that tells us much about the nature of the current pontificate that houses of contemplatives are always attacked by secularist regimes from henry viii to the soviet union nrupture nwhat rupture nthe first thing cor orans does is claim continuity with both pre and postvatican ii theology nin the introduction it seems anxious to establish a xe2 x80 x9chermeneutic of continuity xe2 x80 x9d with pius xii and his document sponsa christi ecclesia of 1950 nthe authors insist there is no contradiction between the two xe2 x80 x93 except of course where there are contradictions xe2 x80 x93 and that both pius xii and francis are keen to see nuns reaching the xe2 x80 x9caim of their specific vocation xe2 x80 x9d it describes francis as promulgating this document xe2 x80 x9cin the wake xe2 x80 x9d of pius xii1 nin fact pope francis by promulgating the apostolic constitution vultum dei quaerere on june 29 2016 to help the contemplatives reach the aim of their specific vocation invited reflection and discernment on the precise content tied to consecrated life in general and to the monastic tradition in particular but he did not intend to abrogate sponsa christi ecclesia that was derogated only in some points nas a consequence the two pontifical documents are to be held as normative in force for monasteries of nuns and must be read in a unitary vision nbut of course the entire game is given away in the next paragraph npope francis in the wake of the teaching of pope pius xii and reaffirmed by ecumenical vatican council ii intended to present in vultum dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the church in the last decades in the light of the teachings of the same council and considering the changed sociocultural conditions nyes that xe2 x80 x99s what it said nhere xe2 x80 x99s my translation n xe2 x80 x9cthe church xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x98path xe2 x80 x99 of the last 50 years has been xe2 x80 x98fruitful xe2 x80 x99 nhow do you know nbecause we xe2 x80 x99re telling you it has xe2 x80 x9d nin other words there have been absolutely no problems whatever with the direction taken either by the church or by the religious life since vatican ii neverything that has happened has been in complete and perfect continuity between the before church and the after church there has been no rupture or break with the past nall changes undertaken by religious houses were perfectly legitimate and good  xe2 x80 x9cfruitful xe2 x80 x9d if perhaps a bit xe2 x80 x9cintense xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x93 and have been made in xe2 x80 x9clight of the teachings xe2 x80 x9d of vatican ii and xe2 x80 x9cchanged sociocultural conditions xe2 x80 x9d there is therefore no legitimate reason whatever for any religious house to attempt to xe2 x80 x9cturn back the clock xe2 x80 x9d to the prevatican ii norms or styles of religious life nanyone attempting to do this are bad nuns insert string of incomprehensible papal insults here nthis is what might be considered the guiding principle of the document xe2 x80 x9cnothing to see here nand if you say there is you xe2 x80 x99re the problem xe2 x80 x9d nof course this kind of bold proclamation is very much in keeping with the habit of this pontificate to simply claim there are no problems and become gravely offended and outraged when the contrary is pointed out nit xe2 x80 x99s your fault if you find contradictions not theirs they xe2 x80 x99ve said there are no contradictions therefore there aren xe2 x80 x99t any nafter all this is the papacy where 2  2  5 if the pope says it does nthe irony of course is built in since this document is intended as a legal chopping block for the dissolution of any house of contemplative nuns that is judged to be hovering on the edge of extinction or is for some other reason in need of the chop nwhy would the vatican need a document giving extensive norms for the closure of monasteries that have too few nuns or do not follow their originally intended charisms if everything about the religious life since vatican ii has been hunky dory nlet xe2 x80 x99s remember that this comes from the congregation for religious of braz de xe2 x80 x99aviz and jose rodriguez carballo nthis is the cardinal braz de xe2 x80 x99aviz2 who wasted no time in orienting himself in the new paradigm when close on the heels of the conclave he slammed the attempt by his predecessor xe2 x80 x93 and by extension pope benedict xe2 x80 x93 to reign in the notorious leadership conference of women religious in the us nhe complained that he had been shut out of the process under cardinal rode and later made a large and public point of appeasing and mollifying the most outspokenly heretical and politicised organisation of female religious in the world napparently the total statistical collapse of the religious life following vatican ii3 had nothing to do with the massive systemic changes to the forms of that life xe2 x80 x93 always claimed to be xe2 x80 x9cmandated xe2 x80 x9d by xe2 x80 x9cthe council xe2 x80 x9d nand of course we are talking about the priorities of a pope who has said that seeing a xe2 x80 x9crestorationist xe2 x80 x9d community enjoying a large number of vocations makes him xe2 x80 x9cworry xe2 x80 x9d apparently this worry was serious enough to move him to torpedo one of the most flourishing communities in the modern church the gaunt spectre of the franciscan friars and sisters of the immaculate haunts this document nautonomy vs nindependence none of the talking points the media have latched onto is the whole business of xe2 x80 x9cautonomy xe2 x80 x9d of monasteries nmany of the headlines crowed xe2 x80 x9cvatican confirms nuns xe2 x80 x99 autonomy xe2 x80 x9d or similar nbut that word does not mean what they think it means nin fact the word xe2 x80 x9cautonomy xe2 x80 x9d is the key to understanding this whole thing nit appears in the document 16 times and xe2 x80 x9cautonomous xe2 x80 x9d 30 times nin fact xe2 x80 x9cautonomy xe2 x80 x9d is held up as the single most important criterion for determining a monastery xe2 x80 x99s viability nthis emphasis is repeated so often one might almost think there is a concern in rome that the xe2 x80 x9cfruitful xe2 x80 x9d postconciliar monastic life is in danger of fizzling out xe2 x80 xa6 for xe2 x80 xa6 some reason xe2 x80 xa6 nmonastery sui juris refers to the religious house of a female monastic community that having the requisites for real autonomy of life was legitimately erected by the holy see and enjoys juridical autonomy under the law n18 in order to obtain juridical autonomy for a monastery of nuns it must presuppose a real autonomy of life that is the ability to manage the life of the monastery in all its dimensions vocational formative governmental relational liturgical economic  nin this case an autonomous monastery is alive and vital n43 autonomy of life a constant prerequisite for maintaining juridical autonomy must be constantly verified by the federal president who when in her judgment a monastery lacks autonomy of life must inform the holy see in view of the nomination of an ad hoc commission n67 affiliation with another monastery appointed by the vatican can be an opportunity for recovery and rebirth when autonomy of life is partially compromised nif the situation of incapacity is irreversible the solution as painful as it is necessary is the suppression of the monastery nno longer possesses a real autonomy of life  it is the responsibility of the federation president to report the matter to the holy see nwhen an autonomous monastery  it is the responsibility ofto the holy see nat the same time this document is redefining the term xe2 x80 x9cautonomous xe2 x80 x9d to exclude independence nwhat got no mention in the brief press interest was the document xe2 x80 x99s insistence that all monasteries of nuns must belong to a federation and while monasteries must demonstrate xe2 x80 x9cautonomy xe2 x80 x9d they will be granted little in the way of powers of selfgovernance nas we will see the federations are now a multilayered system of internal surveillance and centralised control that leaves orwell in the dust novercome isolation and promote regular observance and contemplative life nfederation of monasteries means a structure of communion among some autonomous monasteries of the same institute 4  erected by the holy see that approves the statutes so that in sharing the same charism the federated monasteriesand promote regular observance and contemplative life nnote the change xe2 x80 x9cindependent xe2 x80 x9d is replaced with xe2 x80 x9cisolated5 xe2 x80 x9d it reminds me of a conversation i had with a superior of a benedictine house in the uk nshe said she thought that the psychiatric testing that in 2008 was still all the rage among the houses of her monastery xe2 x80 x99s federation was excessive and not helpful nshe didn xe2 x80 x99t trust the heavily secularised field of psychology to help in determining a candidate xe2 x80 x99s suitability for religious life so she didn xe2 x80 x99t require these tests of her monastery xe2 x80 x99s postulants nshe also said that she was under constant pressure both the subtle pressure of general peer disapproval and overt requests to conform by the federation xe2 x80 x99s leadership nwas that monastery xe2 x80 x9cisolated xe2 x80 x9d nor just exercising lawful selfgovernance nand given that autonomy is being held up as the sole criterion for viability of a monastery it seems the holy see is not interested in asking whether it is actually faithful to the charism or even to the catholic faith a question that has burned brightly for serious catholics for some time nthe word xe2 x80 x9cfidelity xe2 x80 x9d appears in the document four times which may give an idea of how much interest the vatican has in this issue nfunny you should mention autonomy bioethics and the dissolution of xe2 x80 x9cunviable xe2 x80 x9d monasteries nit xe2 x80 x99s funny that the buzzword of the day in rome should be xe2 x80 x9cautonomy xe2 x80 x9d nas we shall see the document is what i xe2 x80 x99ve called above a xe2 x80 x9cchopping block xe2 x80 x9d nvultum dei quaerere made it clear that this juridical document would provide a set of legal criteria by which a monastery can be considered viable religious life worthy of life so to speak and that those considered to have failed the test would be closed nnote the language used here nif the situation of incapacity is irreversible the solution as painful as it is necessary is the suppression of the monastery nit jogged a memory for me n xe2 x80 x9cincapacity xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 xa6 where had i heard that language used before nmost prolife observers in britain will tell you that it was the xe2 x80 x9cmental capacity act xe2 x80 x9d of 2005 that established in british law the concept that a person with permanently xe2 x80 x9creduced capacity xe2 x80 x9d could be legally starved andor dehydrated to death by doctors nthis is the world the language of bioethics applied utilitarianism also called xe2 x80 x9cprinciplism xe2 x80 x9d after its three bioethical criteria of xe2 x80 x9cjustice beneficence6 and autonomy xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x93 it is a patient xe2 x80 x99s ability to demonstrate his xe2 x80 x9cautonomy xe2 x80 x9d or xe2 x80 x9cquality of life7 xe2 x80 x9d either currently or potentially that decides his fate nthis set of criteria is being applied in medical institutions across the western world now a xe2 x80 x9cnew paradigm xe2 x80 x9d of ethics replacing traditional xe2 x80 x9chippocratic xe2 x80 x9d or xe2 x80 x9cnatural law xe2 x80 x9d medical ethics nunder this system the onus effectively is on the patient to prove according to the new criteria that he is worthy of receiving medical treatment xe2 x80 x93 of continuing to live nmedical treatment which legally includes food and water can be withdrawn from patients who fail to demonstrate that they will recover sufficiently to return to an autonomous lifestyle nhealth care systems like that of the uk have government regulatory boards giving out xe2 x80 x9cguidelines xe2 x80 x9d to determine in a uniform way how health care resources are allocated nthese guidelines are collated by professional bioethicists applying their utilitarian criteria nif the equation doesn xe2 x80 x99t come out in the patient xe2 x80 x99s favour the xe2 x80 x9ctreatment xe2 x80 x9d recommended for the patient xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9cbest interests xe2 x80 x9d will include his demise often procured by withdrawing nutrition and hydration andor administering slowly lethal doses of sedatives nthe nhs in the uk has actually gone to court and won declaring that they must retain the right to kill patients who fail the bioethics test nthe result has been a quiet reign of terror in which elderly and disabled people have started carrying cards stating in legalese that they do not want to be killed by their doctors nin one case a man with als took the nhs to court in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to preemptively preclude his medical murder when his illness left him incapacitated nthe system in other words is stacked against the patient in favour of the government that holds all the cards nkeep these facts in mind as we read through the rest of the document ni think we can find an almost perfect analogy by replacing the term xe2 x80 x9cpatient xe2 x80 x9d with xe2 x80 x9cmonastery xe2 x80 x9d think about how one would apply concepts like xe2 x80 x9cautonomy xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cviability xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cincapacity xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cquality of life xe2 x80 x9d and xe2 x80 x9cequitable distribution of scarce resources xe2 x80 x9d to this context nwhen the language of utilitarianism appears in vatican documents as guiding criteria for the contemplative religious life one has to wonder at what point has the entire project gone so disastrously off the rails nfederations as vatican watchdogs nunder this law all monasteries of contemplative nuns must belong to a federation npreviously only voluntary and consultative federations will now have the power to supervise and guide the formation of candidates nuns and of their formators as well as possess broad powers over temporal goods of individual monasteries and powers of suppression nthe document makes it inarguable that the federation xe2 x80 x99s main role will be to establish and monitor for conformity to a particular programme xe2 x80 x93 the xe2 x80 x9cintense and fruitful path xe2 x80 x9d of the church since 1965 xe2 x80 x93 both within the various orders and between them nthe federal assembly ndeals with issues of major importance makes decisions and issues norms that all nuns are required to observe after the definitive approval of the holy see nmore than just federations a multitier system of control nconference of monasteries means a structure of communion among autonomous monasteries belonging to diverse institutes and present in the same region in particular geographical or linguistic contexts nin other words benedictine federations of a given area will form a xe2 x80 x9cconference xe2 x80 x9d with carmelite federations and dominican federations and poor clare federations etc nthis will be of interest to carmelite houses especially since they tend to be generally more on the xe2 x80 x9cconservative xe2 x80 x9d end of things nimagine a house of traditional carmelites attending regional conference meetings xe2 x80 x93 and attempting to keep up their office schedule xe2 x80 x93 with the balloonsandguitars break dancing franciscans xe2 x80 xa6what fun nand finally just in case one entire federation decides to turn back the clock there will be an umbrella for the umbrellas there will be watchers watching the watchers nconfederation means a structure of connection among federations of monasteries erected by the holy see that approves the statutes for the study of themes relative to contemplative life in relation to the same charism to give unitary direction and a certain coordination to the activity of the individual federations nbroad powers nfederations will now have extremely broad powers both over money and property and crucially over formation of nuns nit is the federation that now has the power to monitor for compliance with the rules to report noncompliance to the holy see to make new foundations and apparently to xe2 x80 x9cencourage xe2 x80 x9d individual monasteries to xe2 x80 x9ccommunicate xe2 x80 x9d their goods nthe legitimately established federation is a public juridic person in the church and is therefore able to acquire possess administer and alienate temporal movable and immovable goods which are ecclesiastical assets in accordance with the universal and proper law nto keep alive and strengthen the union of monasteries implementing one of the aims of the federation a certain communication of goods is encouraged among the monasteries coordinated by the federal president nthe communication of goods in a federation is implemented through contributions gifts loans that monasteries offer other monasteries that have financial difficulties and for the common needs of the federation nthe federation considers the assets in its possession as necessary and useful means to achieve its goals nfinancial incentives ngiven that we shall see below that the provisions for suppression of monasteries include vague and indefinable qualities like xe2 x80 x9cvitality in living and transmitting the charism xe2 x80 x9d and xe2 x80 x9cdynamic fidelity xe2 x80 x9d to the order xe2 x80 x99s charism and that the goods of extinct monasteries will be assumed by the federation one might be forgiven for asking if this creates an incentive to see to it that certain houses go extinct8 nsince the document provides several mechanisms by which a federation can move nuns out of a monastery this could be one of those indelicate questions some superiors might want to keep in mind narticle 94 requires that once it is canonically erected the federation is to seek xe2 x80 x9clegal recognition also in the civil sphere xe2 x80 x9d this presumably will bear upon legal disputes in civil courts over the property of suppressed monasteries narticle 73 on the disposition of the material assets of a monastery that has gone completely extinct nin the event of the suppression of a totally extinct monastery when there are no surviving nuns unless otherwise provided by the holy see the destination of the suppressed monastery assets in compliance with canon and civil law go to the respective higher juridical person that is to the federation of monasteries or to another structure of communion among the monasteries equal to it or to the female monastic congregation nthe economic fund of the federation is nourished by the free donations of the monasteries by the donations of benefactors and by revenues deriving from the alienation of the assets of suppressed monasteries as established by the present instruction nfederations in charge of formation nthe federation president in particular watches over initial and ongoing formation in the monasteries to see if it is in conformity with the charism proper to the institute so that every community may be a beacon that illumines the journey of the men and women of our time nat the end of the visit she will inform the holy see about the real possibilities that the monastery has or does not have of guaranteeing initial formation nthe formation of the formators and their collaborators is entrusted in part to the monasteries and in part to the federation therefore the president of the federation is called to strengthen formation at the federal level and to require the participation of those who exercise the service of formation if this does not happen she will refer the matter to the holy see nthe president of the federation having heard the opinion of the federal council chooses the most appropriate places to hold the specific formative courses for the formators and their collaborators as well as those who are called to exercise the service of authority establishing the duration of these courses in such a way that they are not detrimental to the needs of the contemplative life and of the community nwho makes new foundations and why nthroughout the history of the church it has been the prerogative of bishops to establish houses of contemplatives in their own dioceses nnow with the pope having forbidden bishops to exercise this ancient right according to this document the federations themselves can make foundations nthrough the action of the federation as established by the federal assembly the foundation of a monastery of nuns keeping in mind what is established in no n39 of the present instruction can take place either by a single monastery or as established by the federal assembly 9 na single monastic community that decides to make a foundation moreover must be xe2 x80 x9chelped xe2 x80 x9d and guided by the federation nin discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery the federal president and the religious assistant intervene to help the superior of the founding monastery nthe discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the federation is made within the framework of the federal assembly narticle 39 tells us some criteria for making foundations that xe2 x80 x9cmust be considered in their entirety and from an overall perspective xe2 x80 x9d nthe necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism xe2 x80 x9d composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows xe2 x80 x9cas long as most are not of advanced age xe2 x80 x9d na a community that has given good testimony of fraternal life in common with xe2 x80 x9c xe2 x80 x9d composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows xe2 x80 x9cas long as most are not of advanced age xe2 x80 x9d nb besides the number special skills are required of some nuns of the community who must be able to assume as superior the service of authority as formator the initial formation of candidates as financial administrator the administration of the goods of the monastery nc rooms adapted to the lifestyle of the community to ensure that the nuns can regularly lead the contemplative life according to the nature and spirit of their institute nd economic conditions that guarantee the community itself can provide for the needs of daily life none of these things is not like the others ndid you notice none criterion stands out as indeterminate vague compared with the other concrete and measurable standards none aspect of legislative analysis that i learned early was that the terms used are of utmost importance nif a term is vague or is defined incorrectly that is a xe2 x80 x9cloophole xe2 x80 x9d nor it could perhaps be described as a handle a place where a person who wants to effect a particular outcome can grasp a piece of legislation to use it like an axe nso how exactly is it to be determined xe2 x80 x93 and by whom xe2 x80 x93 that a group of nuns possess xe2 x80 x9cthe necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism xe2 x80 x9d nwhat precisely does the term xe2 x80 x9cvitality xe2 x80 x9d mean and exactly how is one to measure out how much is required nis this one of pope francis little personal secret expressions of which only he knows the meaning nlike the secret to how nuns are to smile properly ndoes the inclusion of completely subjective criteria belong in a juridical document nor is it in there in order to provide cover for prelates nthe next article tells us xe2 x80 x9cit is the responsibility of the holy see to evaluate the presence of these requisites xe2 x80 x9d do they have an electronic meter in a cupboard in the congregation for religious that measures xe2 x80 x9ccharism vitality xe2 x80 x9d nit seems important to ask because article 70 on how to suppress a monastery includes it namong the criteria that can contribute to determine a judgment concerning the suppression of a monastery after having examined all the circumstances the following points should be considered as a whole the number of nuns the advanced age of the majority of the members the real capacity for government and formation lack of candidates for a number of years lack of the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism in dynamic fidelity10 nyou will be affiliated resistance is futile xe2 x80 xa6 nit seems there are two themes running through the document to establish a certain value of xe2 x80 x9cautonomy xe2 x80 x9d as the indispensable criterion for viability while at the same time asserting topdown oversight and control over who gets to make this determination nin short a monastery must be autonomous but heaven help the community that asserts its independence narticles 5464 offer an interim measure in the case of xe2 x80 x9cincapacity xe2 x80 x9d that is really just more of the second thing nonce a lack of autonomy has been established xe2 x80 xa6 n54 affiliation is a particular form of help that the holy see establishes in particular situations in favor of the community of a monastery sui juris which has only an asserted autonomy but in reality very precarious or in fact nonexistent n55 affiliation is configured as a juridical support that must assess whether the inability to manage the life of the autonomous monastery in all its dimensions is only temporary or is irreversible helping the community of the affiliated monastery to overcome difficulties or to put in place what is necessary to bring about the suppression of this monastery nhow does affiliation work nwell the federation and the holy see between them work it out nin these cases it is up to the holy see to evaluate the opportunity of setting up an ad hoc commission formed by the ordinary the federation president the federal assistant and the major superior of the monastery nit xe2 x80 x99s starting to be clear that the federation is going to be little more than the big brother hitsquad of the congregation for religious nit xe2 x80 x99s worth remembering what happened in the case of a german men xe2 x80 x99s monastery in which the superior tried to return the community to prevatican ii practices nmariawald trappist monastery xe2 x80 x93 900 years old xe2 x80 x93 was finally dissolved affiliated to death nits superior had made the fatal error of openly declaring xe2 x80 x93 in 2008 after the publication of summorum pontificum xe2 x80 x93 that the monastery xe2 x80 x99s problems all began when it adopted the new liturgical rites and implemented the trends of all religious after vatican ii and that clearly the solution was to go back to preconciliar ways nmariawald was consequently affiliated in the manner this document describes with a liberal house in the netherlands whose superior unsurprisingly discovered that the house was hopelessly divided and could not be saved nwhat would make forced affiliation a truly devastating weapon against conservative or traditional communities is the proviso that an affiliated monastery may not form its own novices n60 the affiliated monastery can accept candidates but the novitiate and initial formation must be performed in the affiliating monastery or in another monastery established by the federation xe2 x80 x9d nof course this means it is the affiliating monastery xe2 x80 x99s formation team that would make the determination to dismiss recalcitrant xe2 x80 x9cneopelagian xe2 x80 x9d postulants and novices n nthis brings us to about article 155 of the document npart two to come n n1 it would seem therefore that a useful task for someone writing about what this pope intends for nuns would be to read sponsa christi ecclesia as well as francis xe2 x80 x99 apostolic constitution and make a careful comparison ni xe2 x80 x99m not going to do that here but it might be helpful to examine the two documents with the help of a expert at some point n2 worth remembering however is the fact that it was benedict the xe2 x80 x9cconservative xe2 x80 x9d not francis who appointed braz de xe2 x80 x99 aviz in the office to replace cardinal rode xe2 x80 x93 presumably under that good old xe2 x80 x9cconservative xe2 x80 x9d rubric of the xe2 x80 x9cbig umbrella xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x93 under whom these culpably belated attempts to save us religious life were started n3 just considering the numbers of course nleaving alone the doctrinal issues n4 xe2 x80 x9cthe same institute xe2 x80 x9d means the order in question whether benedictine dominican carmelite etc n5 i xe2 x80 x99d love to hear from some monastic superior who had the nerve to tell rome xe2 x80 x9cactually given that all our neighbours in religion are raging neomodernist heretics if not schismatics we think xe2 x80 x98isolation xe2 x80 x99 is a desirable thing xe2 x80 x93 like quarantine during an outbreak of bubonic plague xe2 x80 x93 and would therefore like to be dispensed from the federation requirement xe2 x80 x9d i xe2 x80 x99d pay good money to see the shade of purple the wellfed braz de xe2 x80 x99aviz turned n6 xe2 x80 x9cjustice and beneficence xe2 x80 x9d are considered on behalf of the community not the patient n7 bioethicists take it as read that in order for a life to have sufficient xe2 x80 x9cquality xe2 x80 x9d it must demonstrate sufficient autonomy ndependence upon the care of others is quite literally a capital offence n8 readers may think i xe2 x80 x99m exaggerating the danger of material motivations for suppressing monasteries but as we will see the distinction between the federations and the holy see is also a matter of paperwork and it is well to recall that the secretary for the congregation for religious jose rodrigues carballo was a person of interest to international police agencies for the loss of xe2 x80 x9ctens of millions xe2 x80 x9d of euros from the coffers of the franciscan friars minor the original franciscan order of which he had been the head nshortly after carballo xe2 x80 x99s appointment it was revealed that the swiss prosecutor xe2 x80 x99s office was investigating the money missing from the friars minor in connection with drugs money laundering operations and gun running ncarballo was francis xe2 x80 x99 very first appointment april 6 2013 three weeks after the conclave and it was to him that the pope gave the task of the destruction of the ffis and a major part of that operation was to separate the ffis from real assets valued at about 30 million euros n9 so much for the principle of subsidiarity ni can imagine what a monastery founded by a committee would be like to live in n10 we xe2 x80 x99ll pass over xe2 x80 x9cdynamic fidelity xe2 x80 x9d in silence for now xe2 x80 xa6 n,"['black-and-white_fallacy',

nothing to do with nwe xe2 x80 x99re also normal people who happen to be muslim and to see us and our history in america so narrowly is plain out offensive xe2 x80 x9d nwhat is actually offensive is that hamid would try in this way to absolve the muslim community of any responsibility to root out jihad terrorist from its midst nthere is certain to be more jihad terrorism during this ramadan and some of it may be committed by muslims in the us hamid if he cared about this would be confronting honestly the teachings of islam that make ramadan the month of jihad and working to reform them

x99s council said xe2 x80 x9cthe cor orans document is the deathknell of carmel nit signals the end of the contemplative monastic life nnot only does it destroy the autonomy of the monasteries something our holy mother st teresa was extremely insistent about but it also removes the superior dissolves her authority and power removes the financial independence of each monastery and destroys the specificity of each charism n xe2 x80 x9cthis is a disaster nespecially for carmel xe2 x80 x9d ni contrast this frightening comment with those coming from the man immediately responsible for xe2 x80 x9ccor orans xe2 x80 x9d cardinal jo xc3 xa3o braz de aviz the brazilian prefect of the congregation for institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life in a speech to religious formation directors in 2015 in which he laid out pretty clearly what was coming in this piece of legislation 3 years later nin fact as the national catholic reporter piece said the meeting itself was xe2 x80 x9cunprecedented xe2 x80 x9d 1200 formators of religious life gathered by the congregation for religious in order to hear the new marching orders nthis is the programme n xe2 x80 x9cdo not distance yourself from the great lines of the second vatican council xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cin fact those that are distancing themselves from the council to make another path are killing themselves xe2 x80 x93 sooner or later they will die nthey will not have sense nthey will be outside the church nwe need to build using the gospel and the council as a departure point xe2 x80 x9d nafter breathing this threat the cardinal continued saying that because modern people xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9cneeds xe2 x80 x9d are fundamentally different from what they were in the past there was no reason to stick too closely to what the founders and foundresses xe2 x80 x93 people like st anthony st augustine st john cassian st benedict st bruno st dominic sts nfrancis and clare sts nteresa of avila and john of the cross  wanted n xe2 x80 x9cthese contexts have changed nand the council reminds us that consecrated life must be christian discipleship  must be discipleship of the founders that we remember but also must be open to the culture of the present moment xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cwe must not be closed to new things ngod is not static xe2 x80 x9d the cardinal said n xe2 x80 x9cgod is always new movement xe2 x80 x93 of light of heat of demonstration nhe speaks in every time to men and women with the true language of that time xe2 x80 x9d nthe congregation xe2 x80 x99s secretary archbishop jos xc3 xa9 rodr xc3 xadguez carballo is reported as saying xe2 x80 x9cwith this explicit reference to the second vatican council we point to our profound conviction that the council is the point of reference nonnegotiable in the formation to the consecrated life xe2 x80 x9d nnot the charism of the order nor the rule nor the patristic tradition nor the doctors nor the mystics nor any of the 2000yearold tradition of religious life from the desert fathers to the giants of the tridentine period just vatican ii nand only apparently a single xe2 x80 x9cinterpretation xe2 x80 x9d of it if we are to judge by the soap and oil braz de aviz poured on the ruffled feathers of the leadership conference of women religious xe2 x80 x93 the most virulently anticatholic organisation of xe2 x80 x9ccatholic xe2 x80 x9d religious in the world xe2 x80 x93 and by his vicious persecution of the franciscans of the immaculate ncarballo continues his remarks giving us a clue as to his feelings towards strictly cloistered contemplative religious life xe2 x80 x9ca consecrated life a life in god but inserted in the ecclesial family in the church xe2 x80 x93 inserted in the world nnot in conflict with the world but inserted in continuity xe2 x80 x9d he said nit is to wonder what this man would make of a comment by the great dom paul delatte the second abbot of solesmes and successor to the refounder dom gueranger who wrote in his commentary on the rule of st benedict n xe2 x80 x9cthe prologue set this choice before us the world or our lord as mutually exclusive alternatives we cannot remain neutral but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cafter entering into christ by baptism and by the monastic profession we should hold ourselves as far aloof from the world as possible and have no connection with it nthere shall no longer be more intercourse between us than there is between two corpses xe2 x80 x98the world is crucified to me and i to the world xe2 x80 x99 n xe2 x80 x9clet us be on our guard against thinking that it may sometimes be proper to soften the differences to lessen the distance which separates us nthe apostle warns us that we can only please god by preserving the integrity of our true life xe2 x80 x98no man being a soldier to god entangleth himself with secular businesses that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself xe2 x80 x99 the world itself is scandalised by our condescending to it and the words of the imitation of christ are always fulfilled xe2 x80 x98sometimes we think to please others by our company whereas we begin rather to be displeasing to them by reason of the bad qualities they discover in us xe2 x80 x99 xe2 x80 x9d nhow cor orans will end st teresa of avila xe2 x80 x99s reform of carmel nsister t continued saying that the document explicitly derogates the founding intentions of st teresa for whom real autonomy was a crucial element of her carmelite reform nshe acknowledges that cloistered orders of nuns have for some time been gathered into federations nthese are already doing the cor orans programme having shared initial formation programmes for postulants and novices xe2 x80 x9congoing formation xe2 x80 x9d courses for professed nuns a federal abbess or president who oversees all the federated monasteries ntheir funds are already interconnected and they have regular meetings with and input from the male branches nin 2015 carmelite monasteries received a questionnaire from the father general fr nsaverio cannistra a mexican and devotee of liberation theology to ask if they wanted an international commission of nuns to oversee the female houses place of the carmelite fathers nthis suggestion was rejected to the annoyance of maccise nmaccise also promoted the idea of having no superiors in the individual monasteries but only federation presidents and shared formation of novices nthe push for these changes is still on however under the current general an italian saverio cannistr xc3 xa0 ngiven the marxist leanings of the recent crop of fathers general it seems clear that what can be expected by xe2 x80 x9congoing formation xe2 x80 x9d is in essence some form of political indoctrination sprayed over with a microthin layer of pious language nbut for carmelite nuns sister said these ideas are the antithesis of the intentions of st teresa nauthentic autonomy independence of formation and finances xe2 x80 x9care essential points of our charism that our holy mother established and to do away with them is to do away with the charism xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cthey go against our constitutions even though cor orans states that everything is to be done in accord with the charism and constitutions neach carmel has its own spirit its own tempo it xe2 x80 x99s own xe2 x80 x98feel xe2 x80 x99 each nun is called not just to the order but to a specific carmel nformation in common is something we xe2 x80 x99ve been fighting against for years xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cto have a federal president who can decide to take the novices away or take all our finances or tell the holy see we xe2 x80 x99re no longer xe2 x80 x98viable xe2 x80 x99 xe2 x80 x93 this is a disaster nst teresa specifically set up the monasteries so that none of this would take place nand now it xe2 x80 x99s going to be done to us xe2 x80 x9d nshe points to the extended length of formation for new nuns  previously six years for carmelites and under cor orans now nine years as absurd saying it will tend to impede new vocations n xe2 x80 x9cas though the church is going to ask laypeople to be engaged for nine years before they marry nour constitutions already provide a three year extension of temporary vows if needed but to make it mandatory will dissuade women from entering nit will also help the monastery become xe2 x80 x98less viable xe2 x80 x99 because by the time anyone younger is professed the others will be dead xe2 x80 x9d nanother requirement will be for a xe2 x80 x9creligious assistant xe2 x80 x9d a priest monitoring the monastery in addition to a chaplain to be assigned by the federation nsister writes that this was rejected xe2 x80 x9cyears ago xe2 x80 x9d by carmelite monasteries as undue interference nthe religious assistant will have unprecedented powers narticle 23 states for instance xe2 x80 x9cin discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery the federal president and the religious assistant intervene to help the superior of the founding monastery nthe discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the federation is made within the framework of the federal assembly xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cone other thing that is very striking to me is the complete loss of our rights nthere are no options in this document no choices no recourse nit xe2 x80 x99s all being done to us nin this day and age when pope francis is proclaiming if not liberty equality and fraternity then at least license and xe2 x80 x98choice xe2 x80 x99 for all plus the xe2 x80 x98rights xe2 x80 x99 of women here our rights are completely taken away xe2 x80 x9d nanother nun has written saying that they cannot conceive of what these people mean by xe2 x80 x9congoing formation xe2 x80 x9d njudging from other documents from alreadyfederated carmelites in europe it means in practical terms going in groups away from the monastery for days or weeks at a time to take xe2 x80 x9ccourses xe2 x80 x9d together with novices from other monasteries nthe content of these course of course is to be formulated by teams of xe2 x80 x9cexperts xe2 x80 x9d chosen by the federation nsister writes xe2 x80 x9ccloistered nuns have a very full horarium that does not allow for a lot of other things nwe already have to deal with the million unexpected things that come up each day ni have no idea how we are going to implement all these ridiculous plans of xe2 x80 x98ongoing formation xe2 x80 x99 ncan they not comprehend that simply faithfully living our daily life provides plenty of ongoing formation xe2 x80 x9d napparently not nas i wrote in my first analysis piece the document itself xe2 x80 x93 that we must remember is a piece of legislation a legal document laying out what all monasteries of contemplative nuns must now do xe2 x80 x93 starts by laying out its working premise npope francis in the wake of the teaching of pope pius xii and reaffirmed by ecumenical vatican council ii intended to present in vultum dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the church in the last decades in the light of the teachings of the same council and considering the changed sociocultural conditions nin other words it is the xe2 x80 x9cintense and fruitful path xe2 x80 x9d of the last few decades of the church since vatican ii that all monasteries of cloistered contemplative nuns must now take nanyone who imagines that this document xe2 x80 x99s authors will allow leeway that there will be dispensations forthcoming for traditional or xe2 x80 x9cconservative xe2 x80 x9d communities from timid and cowed vatican bodies like ecclesia dei has failed to pay attention nin the last 20 years xe2 x80 x9cconservative xe2 x80 x9d catholics have pointed to the flourishing xe2 x80 x93 mainly in the us xe2 x80 x93 of some groups of sisters who had turned away from the xe2 x80 x9cintense and fruitful path xe2 x80 x9d and reestablished some of the traditional accoutrements of the religious life nthey point to the nashville dominicans the missionaries of charity the poor clares of alabama where there are at least habits some chant common life and common apostolates nbut it is these signs of refusal of the programme that have infuriated the despots of the new paradigm who would not rest until every last individual house of religious life was coopted subverted to the new ideology nthe little green shoots of hope that the faithful catholic world so rejoiced to see are to be stamped back into the frost of vatican ii xe2 x80 x99s perpetual winter nin the continuing analysis that will follow this article we can see that the purpose of this document is to fulfill the totalitarian fantasies of the anticatholic revolutionaries now nearing the end of their lives 50 years after their initial neartriumph nits intention is mopping up either to herd the remaining recalcitrants xe2 x80 x93 those who have resisted even to the softened and conciliating degrees typical of xe2 x80 x9cconservatives xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x93 into the full postconciliar xe2 x80 x9creform xe2 x80 x9d instituted by the revolutionaries in the 1960s xe2 x80 x93 or to close them nthe thing is the result will obviously be the same either way nthe whole world has seen what happens to religious life that takes on the vaticantwoist new paradigm ni have just received a document that was issued privately summarising the findings of a meeting of federated discalced carmelite nuns in europe in 2009 nthe numbers are absolutely dismal nfederation belgium nnumber of convents 11 number of nuns 120 nsolemnly professed 119 nin formation 1 average age 73 nfederation belgium  luxembourg

naverage age 66 nthe rest are similar and i xe2 x80 x99ll be analysing this document in some detail in the next piece in this series but the rest of the responses to the father general xe2 x80 x99s

initial formation and for formators nmeetings for prioresses npresent problems have got very old nsome sisters are in carehomes run by franciscans npossible solutions two convents intend to amalgamate

is attempting to force on the very very few holdouts n,"['appeal_to_fear-prejudice', 'black-and-white_fallacy', 'repetition', 'loaded_language', 'name_calling', 'labeling', 'exaggeration', 'minimisation']"
213,a dismal record why are they destroying the nuns n nthe meeting covered carmels of the teresian discalced reform from germany five areas of spain three from france great britain ireland italy the netherlands austria croatia and the holy land 1  nthe reports from each region showed that many of the provisions found in cor orans were already in place federations with broad powers including financial control and combined formation courses xe2 x80 x9creligious assistant xe2 x80 x9d priests appointed by the federation and overseeing individual monasteries and superiors giving up their authority to the federations ngiven that this was 2009 it is clear that the plans to force all contemplative monasteries in the world into this disastrous european mould were well under way long before pope benedict was even considering resigning ntoday i xe2 x80 x99ve received an interesting document issued by the carmelite order in europe following a meeting of the xe2 x80 x9cfederations of discalced carmelite nuns of europe  the holy land xe2 x80 x9d in avila february 2009 nas a snapshot of the current condition of carmelite monastic life after it had been completely xe2 x80 x9cfederated xe2 x80 x9d it paints a depressing picture but as a demonstration of what xe2 x80 x9cfederations xe2 x80 x9d are likely to achieve once cor orans is implemented universally it clangs in the mind like a funeral bell nreconciled to managed extinction nthe report shows average ages of nuns between 65 and 80 xe2 x80 x9cinfirmary carmels xe2 x80 x9d nuns in state nursing homes entire communities living in care facilities and half the carmels with no one in formation nsolutions offered are equally uniform heapedup bureaucracy common formation courses between monasteries developed by xe2 x80 x9creligious psychologists xe2 x80 x9d ever more powers handed to federations nthis is federated carmelite monastic life under pope francis xe2 x80 x99 new paradigm of fully implemented vaticantwoism nvery little is said of any efforts being made to increase vocational outreach using the internet or through diocesan contacts nand perhaps most telling of all not one word is offered of applying any systematic religious solutions no one is suggesting increased prayer or fasting rosary campaigns or novenas in what has to be the carmelite order xe2 x80 x99s most desperate hour nnothing is said of increased intensity of devotion to the charism study of the foundress or returning to sources still less of strengthening the carmelites xe2 x80 x99 traditional independent selfgovernance or reconsidering the wisdom of xe2 x80 x9cthe path taken xe2 x80 x9d nindeed in one case in spain the sisters themselves advocate abandoning traditional teresian autonomy altogether nthe report from great britain notes xe2 x80 x9c18 carmels have closed in the last 40 years nthere have been two amalgamations in recent years and another one involving three carmels is in process ntwo communities at present are living together in one monastery as a temporary measure xe2 x80 x9d nthe case of the netherlands is downright bizarre sisters so old that even the federation structures are breaking down nonly one fully autonomous functioning carmel still exists in the netherlands and the remains of four entire communities are living in a single care home run by religious brothers nbut in this situation the xe2 x80 x9csolution xe2 x80 x9d undertaken has been an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle including gaining approval from rome for xe2 x80 x9ca completely new structure xe2 x80 x9d whose main task no doubt will be the making of funeral arrangements and disposing of library books nthe atmosphere is weirdly resigned xe2 x80 x93 one federation report recommended simply xe2 x80

xe2 x80 x9d nit is only in the report from croatia where the problem changes abruptly from aging nuns and no vocations to too many vocations with not enough room2 nit is also notable that it is only in the croatian report that christ gets a direct mention nfederation of croatia  bosniaherzegovina 82 nuns in 5 convents with an average age of 47 and eleven in formation nthis outlier differs from the western european federations in several respects notably that it was only federated in 2002 nbut the effects of the federatingformation courses are already being felt xe2 x80 x9cnowadays two

in the statutes in particular regarding our mutual solidarity nalso with the passing of the years the congregation for religious has placed responsibility directly into the hands of the council of the federation nfinally the autonomous carmels have asked help from the federation in order to protect their interests ndue to our very advanced age in the netherlands we have reached the moment when a general assembly is no longer possible nwe are left with the problem that in the communities there are no sisters who can or who want to be prioresses or council sisters nthe structure of the federation that we have had till now is thus no longer possible npossible solutions the federation council the religious assistant together with a canon lawyer of the dutch conference of religious have worked hard on a completely new structure in which in its first draft the autonomy of the carmel has been constantly kept in mind nwe began from three points n1maintenance of the formal autonomy of the carmels that still exist but with the chance to transfer tasks gradually to the council of the federation n n2appointment of the federal board or federal council of the federation preferably appointed by the superior general nthe team will consist of a president and vicepresident who are members of one of the convents appointed to functions and of three people who are members or not of one of the convents n n3a supervisory council also to be appointed periodically by the superior general which will be made up of three members whose president will be preferably a member of a religious institute preferably of the carmelite order and appointed to functions nthis council sees itself as a supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the assembly of the federation nin october 2008 the president the religious assistant and a lawyer were in rome where they explained the proposals nthey had meetings with fr ngeneral and with the congregation for religious nthese were open meetings that helped us to clarify matters nan important concern was that they would allow us to use lay people on the federal council of the federation and the supervisory council nwe were aware that we were not dealing with a simple matter but we think that in view of our present situation today we do not have much choice nit is important to continue to protect the interests of our federation in the most responsible and careful way so that all the sisters even those advanced in years can continue to live their life in carmel ndefinitive permission came at the 25th of february n ngiven this incredible picture of a carmelite order in the last rattle of its death throes the rest of the summaries of speeches given at the meeting in avila read as outright surreal leaving us to wonder if any of these people are attached in any way to reality nsr enrica rosanna the representative of the vatican xe2 x80 x99s congregation for religious told them that the xe2 x80 x9ctwo great challenges to our contemplative life xe2 x80 x9d are xe2 x80 x9cthe challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy xe2 x80 x9d she warned the nuns against bringing vocations from other countries to keep their monasteries alive dropping a hint about what now seems to be a particular obsession of the congregation ncor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018 nthe nuns were exhorted to xe2 x80 x9cstay awake to welcome the dawn xe2 x80 x9d of a bright new future n xe2 x80 x9cthese are difficult and uncertain times but it is also the time to stay awake as the new dawn is already announcing itself xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cour aim must be to be open to the future nwe should not forget that we are following in the tradition of teresa of jesus and in the tradition of all those who have followed in her footsteps nit is a wide road that opens up before us nwe must be women of hope and faith nwe must always believe that god is the one who directs history nfrom this derives our task to be creative and at the same time faithful creative fidelity xe2 x80 x9d emphasis in the original nwhile there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the carmelite order in western europe was foremost in the minds of the nuns present it seems that the issue was simply not addressed out loud by the representatives of the bureaucracy ninstead sr enrica after this bizarre and cryptic comment spoke of the xe2 x80 x9cproblems and difficulties that we can encounter xe2 x80 x9d in discernment of mostly nonexistent vocations including xe2 x80 x9cconsumerism modern means of communication difficulties in creating a stable personality autonomy of the young the need to be always supported the ideology of subjectivism xe2 x80 x9d nwhat are these people smoking ngiven that this was three years or more from the abdication of benedict and the installation of the new paradigm of franciskasper one wonders what this xe2 x80 x9cnew dawn xe2 x80 x9d was actually about nperhaps a useful question for one of the nuns present could have been xe2 x80 x9ca xe2 x80 x98new dawn xe2 x80 x99 of what exactly xe2 x80 x9d this kind of coded language has been popular with the progressivist faction in the church since the 1960s when the expectation was for the installation of a totally new church nwas sr enrica somehow anticipating the fulfillment of those hippieera dreams in the years to come nit is certainly clear from francis xe2 x80 x99 first acts as pope that he had dealing with conservative and traditionalist nuns high on his list of priorities nhis first appointment no more than three weeks after the conclave was jose rodrigues carballo the religious congregation xe2 x80 x99s secretary and xe2 x80 x93 given the scandal that erupted on his leaving them xe2 x80 x93 the financial wrecking ball of the franciscan friars minor nthe first task francis gave carballo was the demolition of the franciscan friars of the immaculate

of authority of superiors of individual monasteries to federations was obviously on someone xe2 x80 x99s mind as was a plan to see to it that monasteries change superiors frequently xe2 x80 x9cessential autonomy can fail due to the relationships within the community abuses by permanent superiors who decide on the freedom and decisions of the community xe2 x80 x9d the father general warned nand there were certainly hints that a general reorganisation of structures of authority was in the works na common tactic of politicians who want to initiate changes is to xe2 x80 x9cask questions xe2 x80 x9d rather than make suggestions and arostegui asked some very leading questions indeed in this closing address n xe2 x80 x9cwho discerns the existence or not of vital autonomy is it the community or chosen people n xe2 x80 x9care there instances that work well within the church which balance autonomy in a way that can be helpful in these situations n xe2 x80 x9cat the time of st teresa she was an example of someone balanced nstability is one reason for autonomy but is stability understood in such a way that it can obstruct the spirit of mission and your availability to the order and to the church n xe2 x80 x9cthe valiant and prophetic initiative of pope pius xii to create associations and federations opened up contemplative life though it was also thought that it could harm cloister and autonomy ncan such essential autonomy continue as it is n xe2 x80 x9c50 years ago there was stability nhow do we conceive today the relationship between autonomy and federationassociation and between autonomy and fr ngeneral n xe2 x80 x9ccould there be other forms of government xe2 x80 x9d nfollowing the father general xe2 x80 x99s address are notes from the language groups including the following n xe2 x80 x9cwhile some communities do not want their autonomy to be touched and have certain fears of xe2 x80 x98external xe2 x80 x99 interference others want a more moderate and flexible autonomy that without going to the congregation would have a juridical form where the president with her council can intervene in extreme cases that today we watch with pain our hands tied nthough we want these legal channels to be established it must remain clear what the limits of the federation council are in order to avoid abuses of power on the part of the same xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cthe absence of vital autonomy is also noticed when xe2 x80 xa6 the same person remains prioress for years xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cwe need criteria that expand number 203 of our constitutions and clarify vital autonomy nwe perceive that there is a shortage of authority figures nwe do not want new figures but rather those that already exist associations federation presidents provincials be empowered in a legal way canonically to help communities in difficulty for the mission to discern to counsel to accompany xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cwe are also concerned for those communities not affiliated to federations we see that we should be close to them xe2 x80 x9d nmaybe this summary document of 2009 can give us an idea what to expect from rome in 2018 now that the xe2 x80 x9cprogressivist xe2 x80 x9d faction in the vatican is in the ascendancy and is free to act without restriction nwhat comes clear comparing this document to cor orans is that the vatican xe2 x80 x99s machinery has long been at work forcing a uniform and essentially bureaucratic heavily authoritarian and legalistic vision of contemplative life on anyone who fails sufficiently to resist it nand with the statistics offered at this meeting we can see clearly where this road leads nso many catholics in the last 40 years assumed that under the xe2 x80 x9cconservatives xe2 x80 x9d john paul ii and benedict xvi at least the vatican was xe2 x80 x9conside xe2 x80 x9d at least in rome they understood the terrible threat of the bolshie vaticantwoist revolutionaries nbut this report of 2009 shows a clear picture of a roman congregation determined to see the revolution through to its inevitable conclusion n n1 an aside that will perhaps be noteworthy to traditionalist readers is the little comment in the report on the difficulty of having a liturgical observance between all the disparate nations represented at the meeting n xe2 x80 x9ceucharist and lauds in spanish nfr nisidore d xe2 x80 x99silva had prepared a booklet with the liturgy for each day neach psalm was in a different language and was prepared by the corresponding liturgical group nhowever having the text in front of us made it easier to follow the recitation in other languages nthe end result was that we could all join in the liturgy nwe were all united in the praise of the spirit who had brought us there together from different languages and nations xe2 x80 x9d n2 solution new foundations the spreading of the carmelite charism into new territories n3 this includes all sisters up to final profession not just

legal and illegal declined from the same month of the prior year nsimultaneously immigrant displacement of american workers fell also apparently confirming a trend that began in september nand by the way black unemployment is at a record low nwhat started after the 2016 election as a reduction in the rate of increase in the foreignborn population of working age has turned into an outright retreat nthis is in dramatic contrast to the last months of the obama regime which saw yearoveryear increases in immigrant workingage population far in excess of the estimated 1 million legal immigrants admitted annually and which i argued meant that an unreported illegal alien surge was underway naccording to the labor department employment report released last friday december there were 77000 fewer workingage immigrants legal and illegal in the country in december 2017 than in december 2016 xe2 x80 x94a decline of 018 nthis follows yearoveryear drops of 138000 in august 143000 in september and 117000 in october and 64000 in november nnot since the great recession has the foreignborn workingage population declined for five consecutive months xe2 x80 x94but now in telling contrast the economy is expanding nthis makes the trump era immigrant workforce decline especially striking nnote that this is a net figure nthe yearover year reduction in the immigrant workingage population does not mean new immigrants have stopped coming in nabout 300000 immigrants die annually and an equal number leave voluntarily or otherwise according to a study by the center for immigration studies nus nimmigrant population hit record 437 million in 2016 by steven a camarota and karen zeigleroctober 16 2017 so the 77000 reduction in workingage immigrants from december 2016 to december 2017 is consistent with a gross inflow of about 500000 new foreignborn workers legal and illegal over that period xe2 x80 x94the gross inflow more than offset by the gross reduction of 600000 due to deaths deportations and immigrant emigrants nthis helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the us southwest

spoke with john pilger a close friend and supporter of assange on may 29 nthe interview began with the statement bernstein delivered for pilger at the left forum last weekend in new york on a panel devoted to assange entitled xe2 x80 x9crussiagate and wikileaks xe2 x80 x9d npilger xe2 x80 x99s statement n xe2 x80 x9cthere is a silence among many who call themselves left nthe silence is julian assange nas every false accusation has fallen away every bogus smear shown to be the work of political enemies julian stands vindicated as one who has exposed a system that threatens humanity nthe collateral damage video the war logs of afghanistan and iraq the cablegate revelations the venezuela revelations the podesta email revelations xe2 x80 xa6 these are just a few of the storms of raw truth that have blown through the capitals of rapacious power nthe fakery of russiagate the collusion of a corrupt media and the shame of a legal system that pursues truthtellers have not been able to hold back the raw truth of wikileaks revelations nthey have not won not yet and they have not destroyed the man nonly the silence of good people will allow them to win njulian assange has never been more isolated nhe needs your support and your voice nnow more than ever is the time to demand justice and free speech for julian nthank you xe2 x80 x9d no place to hide edwa glenn greenwald best price 149 buy new 370 as of 0630 edt  details ndennis bernstein we continue our discussion of the case of julian assange now in the ecuadorian embassy in great britain njohn pilger it is great to talk to you again nbut it is a profound tragedy john the way they are treating julian assange this prolific journalist and publisher who so many other journalists have depended on in the past nhe has been totally left out in the cold to fend for himself njohn pilger i have never known anything like it nthere is a kind of eerie silence around the julian assange case njulian has been vindicated in every possible way and yet he is isolated as few people are these days nhe is cut off from the very tools of his trade visitors aren xe2 x80 x99t allowed ni was in london recently and i couldn xe2 x80 x99t see him although i spoke to people who had seen him nrafael correa the former president of ecuador said recently that he regarded what they are doing to julian now as torture nit was correa xe2 x80 x99s government that gave julian political refuge which has been betrayed now by his successor the government led by lenin moreno which is back to sucking up to the united states in the timehonored way with julian as the pawn and victim nshould be a xe2 x80 x98constitutional hero xe2 x80 x99 nbut really it comes down to the british government nalthough he is still in a foreign embassy and actually has ecuadorian nationality his right of passage out of that embassy should be guaranteed by the british government nthe united nations working party on unlawful detentions has made that clear nbritain took part in an investigation which determined that julian was a political refugee and that a great miscarriage of justice had been imposed on him nit is very good that you are doing this dennis because even in the media outside the mainstream there is this silence about julian nthe streets outside the embassy are virtually empty whereas they should be full of people saying that we are with you nthe principles involved in this case are absolutely clearcut nnumber one is justice nthe injustice done to this man is legion both in terms of the bogus swedish case and now the fact that he must remain in the embassy and can xe2 x80 x99t leave without being arrested extradited to the united states and ending up in a hell hole nbut it is also about freedom of speech about our right to know which is enshrined in the united states constitution nif the constitution were taken literally julian would be a constitutional hero actually ninstead i understand the indictment they are trying to concoct reads like a charge of espionage nit xe2 x80 x99s so ridiculousthat is the situation as i see it dennis nit is not a happy one but it is one that people should rally to quickly ndb his journalistic brethren are sounding like his prosecutors nthey want to get behind russiagate freaks like congressman adam schiff and mike pompeo who would like to see assange in jail forever or even executed nhow do you respond to journalists acting like prosecutors some of whom used his material to do stories nthis is a terrible time for journalism njp you are absolutely right it is a terrible time for journalism ni have never known anything quite like it in my career nthat said it is not new nthere has always been a socalled mainstream which really comes down to great power in media nit has always existed particularly in the united states nthe pulitzer prize this year was awarded to the new york times and the washington post for witchhunting around russiagate nthey were praised for xe2 x80 x9chow deeply sourced their investigations were xe2 x80 x9d their investigations turned up not a shred of real evidence to suggest any serious russian intervention in the 2016 election nlike webb nthe julian assange case reminds me of the gary webb case nbob parry was one of gary webb xe2 x80 x99s few supporters in the media nwebb xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9cdark alliance xe2 x80 x9d series contained evidence that cocaine trafficking was going on with the connivance of the cia nlater webb was hounded by fellow journalists and unable to find work he eventually committed suicide nthe cia inspector general subsequently vindicated him nnow julian assange is a long way from taking his own life nhis resilience is remarkable nbut he is still a human being and he has taken such a battering nprobably the hardest thing for him to take is the utter hypocrisy of news organizations xe2 x80 x94like the new york times which published the wikileaks xe2 x80 x9cwar logs xe2 x80 x9d and xe2 x80 x9ccablegate xe2 x80 x9d the washington post and the guardian which has taken a vindictive delight in tormenting julian nthe guardian a few years ago got a pulitzer prize writing about snowden nbut their coverage of snowden left him in hong kong nit was wikileaks that got snowden out of hong kong and to safety nprofessionally i find this one of the most unsavory and immoral things i have seen in my career nthe persecution of this man by huge media organizations which have drawn great benefit from wikileaks none of assange xe2 x80 x99s great tormentors the guardian xe2 x80 x98s luke harding made a great deal of money with a hollywood version of a book that he and david lee wrote in which they basically attacked their source ni suppose you have to be a psychiatrist to understand all of this nmy understanding is that so many of these journalists are shamed nthey realize that wikileaks has done what they should have done a long time ago and that is to tell us how governments lie ndb one thing that disturbs me greatly is the way in which the western corporate press speculate about russian involvement in the us 2016 election that it was a hack through julian assange nany serious investigator would want to know who would be motivated nand yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so pissedoff people who went to work for the clinton machine and learned from the inside that the dnc was all about getting rid of bernie sanders xe2 x80 xa6this is not a part of the story neight hundred thousand disclosures on russia njp what happened to sanders and the way that he was rolled by the clinton organization everybody knows that this is the story nand now we have the dnc suing wikileaks nthere xe2 x80 x99s a kind of farcical element to this ni mean none of this came from the russians nthat wikileaks is somehow in bed with the russians is ludicrous nwikileaks published about 800000 major disclosures about russia some of them extremely critical of the russian government nif you are a government and you are doing something untoward or you are lying to your people and wikileaks gets the documents to show it they will publish no matter who you are be they the united states or russia ndb randy credico because of his work and his decision to devote a very highprofile series to the persecution of julian assange recently found himself under attack nhe went to the white house press roast and after having a nice discussion with congressman schiff he yelled out xe2 x80 x9cwhat about julian assange xe2 x80 x9d the room was packed full of reporters but randy was attacked and dragged out nit was if everyone there was embarrassed to recognize that one of their brethren was being brutalized njp randy shouted some truth nit is very similar to what happened to ray mcgovern nray is a former member of the cia but extremely principled ni might suggest he is a renegade now ndb it was hysterical to watch these four armed guards who kept shouting xe2 x80 x9cstop resisting stop resisting xe2 x80 x9d and they are beating the hell out of him njp i thought the image of ray being hauled off was particularly telling nthese four overweight obviously illtrained young men manhandling ray who is 78 years old nthere was something highly emblematic about that for me nhe stood up to challenge the fact that the cia was about to hand over leadership to a person who had been in charge of torture nit is both shocking and surreal which of course the julian assange case is as well nbut real journalism should be able to get through the shocking and the surreal and get to the truth nthere is so much collusion now with all these dark and menacing developments nit is almost as if the word xe2 x80 x9cjournalism xe2 x80 x9d is becoming blighted ndb there has certainly been a lot of collusion when it comes to israel nthen the word xe2 x80 x9ccollusion xe2 x80 x9d is quite appropriate njpthat xe2 x80 x99s the ultimate collusion nbut that xe2 x80 x99s collusion with silence nnever has there been a collusion like the one between the us and israel nit suggests another word and that is xe2 x80 x9cimmunity xe2 x80 x9d it has a moral immunity a cultural immunity a geopolitical immunity a legal immunity and certainly a media immunity nwe see the gunning down of over 60 people on the day of the inauguration of the new us embassy in jerusalem nisrael has some of the most wickedly experimental munitions in the world and they fired them at people who were protesting the occupation of their homeland and trying to remind people of the nakba and the right of return nin the media these were described as xe2 x80 x9cclashes xe2 x80 x9d although they did become so bad that the new york times in a later edition changed its front page headline to say that israel was actually killing people na rare moment indeed when the immunity the collusion was interrupted nall the talk of iran and nuclear weapons is without any reference to the biggest nuclear power in the middle east ndb what would you say have been the contributions that julian assange has made in this age of censorship and cowardice in journalism nwhere does he come into the picture njpi think it comes down to information nif you go back to when wikileaks started when julian was sitting in his hotel room in paris beginning to put the whole thing together one of the first things he wrote was that there is a morality in transparency that we have a right to know what those who wish to control our lives are doing in secret nthe right to know what governments are doing in our name xe2 x80 x94on our behalf or to our detriment xe2 x80 x94is our moral right njulian feels very passionately about this nthere were times when he could have compromised slightly in order to possibly help his situation nthere were times when i said to him xe2 x80 x9cwhy don xe2 x80 x99t you just suspend that for a while and go along with it xe2 x80 x9d of course i knew beforehand what his answer would be and that was xe2 x80 x9cno xe2 x80 x9d the enormous amount of information that has come from wikileaks particularly in recent years has amounted to an extraordinary public service ni was reading just the other day a 2006 wikileaks cable from the us embassy in caracas which was addressed to other agencies in the region nthis was four years after the us tried to get rid of chavez in a coup nit detailed how subversion should work nof course they dressed it up as human rights work and so on ni was reading this official document thinking how the information contained in it was worth years of the kind of distorted reporting from venezuela nit also reminds us that socalled xe2 x80 x9cmeddling xe2 x80 x9d by russia in the us is just nonsense nthe word xe2 x80 x9cmeddling xe2 x80 x9d doesn xe2 x80 x99t apply to the kind of action implied in this document nit is intervention in another country xe2 x80 x99s affairs nwikileaks has done that all over the world nit has given people the information they have a right to have nthey had a right to find out from the socalled xe2 x80 x9cwar logs xe2 x80 x9d the criminality of our wars in afghanistan and iraq nthey had a right to find out about cablegate nthat xe2 x80 x99s when on clinton xe2 x80 x99s watch we learned that the nsa was gathering personal information on members of the united nations security council including their credit card numbers nyou can see why julian made enemies nbut he should also have made a huge number of friends nthis is critical information because it tells us how power works and we will never learn about it otherwise ni think wikileaks has opened a world of transparency and put flesh on the expression xe2 x80 x9cright to know xe2 x80 x9d this must explain why he is attacked so much because that is so threatening nthe enemy to great power is not the likes of the taliban it is us ndb and who can forget the release of the xe2 x80 x9ccollateral murder xe2 x80 x9d footage by chelsea manning njp that kind of thing is not uncommon nvietnam was meant to be the open war but really it wasn xe2 x80 x99t nthere weren xe2 x80 x99t the cameras around nit is indeed shocking information but it informs people and we have chelsea manning xe2 x80 x99s courage to thank for that ndb yes and the thanks he got was seven years in solitary confinement nthey want to prosecute assange and maybe hang him from the rafters in congress but what about judith miller and the new york times lying the west into war nthere is no end of horrific examples of what passes for journalism in contrast to the amazing contribution that julian assange has made nclick here to listen to this interview n,"['appeal_to_fear-prejudice', 'appeal_to_authority', 'repetition', 'loaded_language', 'flag-waving',

235,fbi ig report a slap on the wrist n ndepartment of justice inspector general michael e horowitz has released his 500 pluspage report which purports to shine a light on the mishandling at top levels of the department of justice and federal bureau of investigation of the 2016 investigation into hillary clinton xe2 x80 x99s use of a private email server while she served as secretary of state under former president obama nsuch mishandling included violations of department of justice standards and fbi protocols nthe report from the department of justice xe2 x80 x99s office of the inspector general  xe2 x80 x9coig xe2 x80 x9d criticized certain actions and decisions of former fbi director james comey together with those of other senior fbi officials who were involved in the probe including former deputy fbi director andrew mccabe nmr mccabe is already the subject of an earlier criminal referral from the oig for his alleged unauthorized leaks to the media and lying to federal investigators about his media contacts nspecial fbi agent peter stzrok and lisa page an attorney who has since left the fbi were targeted in this report for their blatantly antitrump text messages nformer attorney general loretta lynch was also criticized for exercising bad judgment in connection with her infamous tarmac meeting with bill clinton nmr horowitz xe2 x80 x99s report focused on process and procedures nthe inspector general made clear when he launched his investigation in january 2017 that xe2 x80 x9chis review will not substitute the oig  judgment for the judgments made by the fbi or the department regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions nmoreover this report did not address whether the department of justice or fbi abused the foreign intelligence surveillance act to obtain a surveillance order against former trump campaign advisor carter page or the government xe2 x80 x99s reliance on former british intelligence agent christopher steele xe2 x80 x99s salacious and unverified xe2 x80 x9cdossier xe2 x80 x9d in its fisa court application which the oig is investigating separately nin analyzing the highly anticipated oig report xe2 x80 x99s conclusions it is clear that either mr horowitz himself decided to pull his punches or that the final version which had been reviewed by upper echelons in both the fbi and justice department before its public release emerged in a disappointingly watereddown form nto be sure the report faulted comey for deviating from fbi and justice department procedures in handling the probe into hillary clinton xe2 x80 x99s use of a private email server while she served as secretary of state thereby negatively impacting xe2 x80 x9cthe perception of the fbi and the department as fair administrators of justice xe2 x80 x9d comey according to the oig report xe2 x80 x9cengaged in ad hoc decision making based on his personal views even if it meant rejecting longstanding department policy or practice xe2 x80 x9d nstarting with comey xe2 x80 x99s public announcement on july 5 2016 criticizing hillary clinton and her staff for being xe2 x80 x9cextremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information xe2 x80 x9d but also announcing that the fbi was xe2 x80 x9cexpressing to justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case xe2 x80 x9d comey was taken to task for insubordination and usurping the authority of the attorney general nhe xe2 x80 x9cupset the wellestablished separation between investigative and prosecutorial functions xe2 x80 x9d the report said ncomey xe2 x80 x99s followup letters to congress on october 28 and november 6 2016 were similarly criticized nthe first letter informed congress that agents were reopening their probe into clinton xe2 x80 x99s handling of classified material after discovering her emails on the laptop of andrew weiner the husband of clinton xe2 x80 x99s top aide huma abedin nthis letter was followed on november 6 2016 by comey xe2 x80 x99s statement that the review of the additional information had been completed and that the fbi remained convinced that charges were not appropriate ncomey acted against the advice of senior justice department officials in making these disclosures the way he did nthe oig report was highly critical of the fbi xe2 x80 x99s failure to take immediate action on the weiner laptop when they first learned about it in late september 2016 rather than waiting another month so close to the election nthe criticisms of comey  undisciplined behavior was all well and good but it was reasonable to expect something more than the equivalent of a departmental employee review after nearly a year and a half of investigation nhillary clinton xe2 x80 x99s supporters will no doubt jump on the inspector general xe2 x80 x99s criticisms of comey xe2 x80 x99s handling of the july 5th announcement and subsequent letters as proof that he improperly influenced the outcome of the election in president trump xe2 x80 x99s favor even if he did not do so deliberately for political reasons nhowever what comey really did was to give hillary clinton a get out of jail free card nthe fix was in as early as may 2016 well before the fbi interviews of hillary clinton and of as many as 17 other key witnesses when comey began the process of drafting an exoneration memo ncomey xe2 x80 x99s initial draft statement which he shared with fbi senior leadership on may 2 criticized clinton xe2 x80 x99s handling of classified information as xe2 x80 x9cgrossly negligent xe2 x80 x9d but concluded that xe2 x80 x9cno reasonable prosecutor xe2 x80 x9d would bring a case based on the facts developed in the investigation nindeed comey admitted in his book that xe2 x80 x9cwe started the clinton investigation aware that it was unlikely to be a case that career prosecutors at the department of justice would prosecute xe2 x80 x9d nif putting the cart of exoneration before the horse of investigation were not enough comey xe2 x80 x99s draft statement underwent various language changes over the course of the next two months including most importantly changing the description of clinton xe2 x80 x99s handling of classified information from xe2 x80 x9cgrossly negligent xe2 x80 x9d to xe2 x80 x9cextremely careless xe2 x80 x9d this change was critical because xe2 x80 x9cgross negligence xe2 x80 x9d is specifically the legal term used in stating the statutory requirement in 18 us code xc2 xa7 793f for a finding of criminal conduct ncomey xe2 x80 x99s substitution of a legally meaningless phrase xe2 x80 x9cextremely careless xe2 x80 x9d for the xe2 x80 x9cgross negligence xe2 x80 x9d statutory legal standard he had originally used had the effect of prejudging the facts in hillary clinton xe2 x80 x99s favor nandrew mccabe peter strzok and lisa page were involved in the edits ninspector general horowitz saw no problem with this pattern of obfuscation regarding the deletion of the legally significant phrase xe2 x80 x9cgross negligence xe2 x80 x9d from comey xe2 x80 x99s statement nmr horowitz relied in part on opinions from prosecutors that there was not enough evidence to charge clinton with acting in a manner that rose to a level of criminal gross negligence with respect to sending or receiving emails determined to contain classified information nmr horowitz xe2 x80 x99s report thus concluded xe2 x80 x9cwe did not identify evidence of bias or improper considerations xe2 x80 x9d this conclusion defies common sense ngross negligence is not the same as willful intent which comey and his team sought to conflate in exonerating hillary clinton before the investigation was concluded nclinton was fully aware of what she was doing when she set up the private server arrangement in the first place and knowingly used it to send and receive emails involving official government business which by their very nature would be expected to include classified information nit turns out that some of the emails were accessed by foreign parties nhillary lied repeatedly when she first denied there were any classified emails on her system and then described some of the emails involved in the investigation as having been classified after the fact nas comey has admitted several email chains concerned matters that were classified at the top secretspecial access program level when they were sent and received by clinton ncoupled with her agents xe2 x80 x99 destruction of thousands of emails that had been subpoenaed by congress hillary xe2 x80 x99s conduct was criminally reckless at the very least if not constituting willful intent to commit an act she knew was wrongful nyet mr horowitz saw no reason to doubt the sincerity of comey  explanations for giving hillary a free pass nthe failure to at least empanel a grand jury to compel testimony from hillary clinton and key witnesses was itself a complete dereliction of duty which could have only been motivated by a desire to treat hillary clinton with kid gloves for improper reasons nincredibly however mr horowitz xe2 x80 x99s report xe2 x80 x9cfound no persuasive evidence xe2 x80 xa6 that the outcome of the investigation would have been different had clinton been subpoenaed before the grand jury xe2 x80 x9d nmr horowitz also did not deem comey xe2 x80 x99s possible perjury in his testimony before congress to be an appropriate subject for criminal referral ncomey testified that his decision to exonerate hillary was not made before her interview took place when for all intents and purposes it was nmr horowitz simply took comey xe2 x80 x99s word for what he had meant ninspector general horowitz again emphasized form and process over substance in finding a xe2 x80 x9ctroubling lack of any direct substantive communication xe2 x80 x9d between comey and attorney general lynch ahead of comey xe2 x80 x99s july 5 press conference on clinton and his october 28 letter to congress nattorney general lynch xe2 x80 x99s infamous tarmac meeting with bill clinton was discussed in the report but mostly in the context of how it affected comey xe2 x80 x99s decision to go rogue so to speak in making his july 5th announcement without prior approval from the justice department nas to the substance of ms lynch xe2 x80 x99s decision to meet with bill clinton at all before his wife xe2 x80 x99s fbi interview all mr horowitz xe2 x80 x99s report had to say was that it was xe2 x80 x9can error in judgment xe2 x80 x9d nthe oig report also criticized the conduct of peter strzok and lisa page who had exchanged text messages sharply critical of mr trump before and after the election for casting xe2 x80 x9ca cloud over the entire fbi investigation xe2 x80 x9d the report referenced a text message on august 8 2016 in which strzok reassured page that she need not worry about donald trump becoming president ntrump is xe2 x80 x9cnot ever going to become president right nright n xe2 x80 x9d page texted strzok n xe2 x80 x9cno nno he xe2 x80 x99s not nwe xe2 x80 x99ll stop it xe2 x80 x9d strzok responded nmr horowitz wrote that this exchange was xe2 x80 x9cnot only indicative of a biased state of mind but even more seriously implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate xe2 x80 x99s electoral prospects xe2 x80 x9d the inspector general questioned whether strzok xe2 x80 x99s decision to prioritize the russia collusion investigation over following up on the clinton emailrelated investigative lead discovered on the weiner laptop was free from bias nultimately however he inexplicably concluded that there was no finding of xe2 x80 x9cdocumentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations including political bias directly affected the specific investigative decisions xe2 x80 x9d discussed in the oig report nstrzok should have been subject to a criminal referral for arguably violating 18 usc n xc2 xa7 595 enacted as part of the original 1939 hatch act prohibiting any public officer or employee in connection with an activity financed wholly or in part by the united states from using his or her official authority to interfere with or affect the nomination or election of a candidate for federal office including the president of the united states nthe punishment for violation is a fine imprisonment for not more than one year or both ninstead strzok  punishment will most likely be limited to disciplinary action and possibly dismissal nin sum the longawaited inspector general report on the fbi xe2 x80 x99s and justice department xe2 x80 x99s handling of the hillary clinton email investigation is as disappointing as the rigged outcome of the email investigation itself n,"['repetition', 'loaded_language',

investigation has finally been released to the public and while it does indeed lambaste former fbi director james comey for his terrible judgment and handling of the clinton investigation it stops short of blaming it all on politics nhorowitz xe2 x80 x99 report not only slams comey but it also criticizes former attorney general loretta lynch and immoral fbi philanderers peter strzok and lisa

find solid proof that the agency acted in a politically partisan and biased manner in the clinton email case nhowever the inspector general left the door open to the possibility that political bias did indeed play a role as his current investigation in the russiacollusion probe of the fbi and the doj could reveal new evidence to damn the fbi xe2 x80 x99s obama era leadership nwhile the report refuses to say conclusively that political bias was the animus behind the fbi xe2 x80 x99s handling of the clinton probe it also indicates that ig horowitz may have more to say about the fbi xe2 x80 x99s political leanings in his russia report nthe washington post explains nthe justice department inspector general on thursday castigated former fbi director james b comey for his actions during the hillary clinton email investigation and found that other senior bureau officials showed a xe2 x80 x9cwillingness to take official action xe2 x80 x9d to prevent donald trump from becoming president xe2 x80 xa6 some senior bureau officials the report found exhibited a disturbing xe2 x80 x9cwillingness to take official action xe2 x80 x9d to hurt trump xe2 x80 x99s chances to become president nperhaps the most damaging new revelation in the report is a previouslyunreported text message in which peter strzok a key investigator on both the clinton email case and the investigation of russia and the trump campaign assured an fbi lawyer in august 2016 that xe2 x80 x9cwe xe2 x80 x99ll stop xe2 x80 x9d trump from making it to the white house n xe2 x80 x9ctrump xe2 x80 x99s not ever going to become

general concluded that strzok xe2 x80 x99s text along with others disparaging trump xe2 x80 x9cis not only indicative of a biased state of mind but even more seriously implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate xe2 x80 x99s electoral prospects xe2 x80 x9d nthe messages xe2 x80 x9cpotentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations xe2 x80 x9d the inspector general wrote xe2 x80 xa6 nstrzok has argued that he was just trying to reassure page that trump couldn xe2 x80 x99t win and that he wasn xe2 x80 x99t implying that they would take action to stop his election nbut it wasn xe2 x80 x99t just page and strzok there were five other investigators on the clinton case who expressed overtly political views in support of clinton andor against trump xe2 x80 xa6 during the investigation npage and strzok are not the only fbi officials assigned to the clinton email probe who were found to have exchanged personal messages indicating either an animus against trump or frustration with the fact that the fbi was investigating clinton nthe report identified five officials with some connection to the email probe who were expressing political views faulting them for having brought xe2 x80 x9cdiscredit to themselves sowed doubt about the fbi xe2 x80 x99s handling of the midyear investigation and impacted the reputation of the fbi xe2 x80 x9d the midyear investigation refers to the clinton email probe n xe2 x80 x9cthe messages cast a cloud over the fbi investigations to which these employees were assigned xe2 x80 x9d horowitz alleged n xe2 x80 x9cultimately the consequences of these actions impact not only the senders of these messages but also other who worked on these investigation and indeed the entire fbi xe2 x80 x9d nthe ig also found that the fbi moved slowly on new evidence that could have damned hillary clinton and did so for reasons that make no sense nthe report took particular aim at fbi officials investigating clinton xe2 x80 x99s email server for moving slowly after agents in the new york field office discovered messages on the laptop of disgraced former congressman anthony weiner that might be relevant to their case nby no later than september 29 the inspector general alleged the bureau had learned xe2 x80 x9cvirtually every fact xe2 x80 x9d it would cite as justification late the next month to search weiner xe2 x80 x99s laptop for messages of clinton and top aide huma abedin nthe inspector general derided the bureau xe2 x80 x99s reasons for not moving more quickly xe2 x80 x94 that agents were waiting for additional information from new york that they couldn xe2 x80 x99t move without a warrant and that investigators were more focused on the russia case xe2 x80 x94 as xe2 x80 x9cunpersuasive xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cillogical xe2 x80 x9d and inconsistent with their assertion that they would leave no stone unturned on clinton nthe report also faulted the bureau for assigning essentially the same personnel to the russia and clinton teams and singled out strzok suggesting his antitrump views might have played a role in his not acting more expeditiously on the new lead n xe2 x80 x9cunder these circumstances we did not have confidence that strzok xe2 x80 x99s decision to prioritize the russia investigation over following up on the midyearrelated investigative lead discovered on the weiner laptop was free from bias xe2 x80 x9d the report said ndid you get that nig horowitz can xe2 x80 x99t prove it but he xe2 x80 x99s not sure that strzok wasn xe2 x80 x99t acting in a politically biased manner when he slowplayed the clinton investigation while moving more quickly on the russia investigation nhow in the world can we trust them even as they express bias while investigating malfeasance nwe see this kind of corruption all over the world why should believe that these officials could be immune to acting on their personal biases nthere were 7 of them on the case and they were comfortable enough with each other to express their biases openly and none of them ever chastised the others for expressing those biases nnot only that the team that handled clinton xe2 x80 x99s investigation so poorly was almost the identical team that was then assigned to handle the russia investigation nmeaning the obviously politically biased team that had just cleared the woman that they supported was now tapped to investigate if the man that they hated was tied to russian corruption nthis is insane nmeanwhile another story just breaking at fox news provides even more evidence that peter strzok is the big bad guy in the fbi mess nnot only was he slowplaying the clinton investigation he may be the only reason she was never charged with a crime nin a newly released fbi email we learned that xe2 x80 x9cforeign actors xe2 x80 x9d gained at least some access to hillary clinton xe2 x80 x99s unsecure email system nfox news obtained the memo prepared by the house judiciary and oversight committees which lays out key interim findings ahead of next week xe2 x80 x99s hearing with justice department inspector general michael horowitz nthe ig separately is expected to release his highly anticipated report on the clinton email case later thursday nthe house committees which conducted a joint probe into decisions made by the doj in 2016 and 2017 addressed a range of issues in their memo including clinton xe2 x80 x99s email security n xe2 x80 x9cdocuments provided to the committees show foreign actors obtained access to some of mrs clinton xe2 x80 x99s emails xe2 x80 x94 including at least one email classified xe2 x80 x98secret xe2 x80 x9d the memo says adding that foreign actors also accessed the private accounts of some clinton staffers nhere xe2 x80 x99s the email in question npeter strzok email about clinton emails by fox news on scribd nthe email came from fbi agent peter strzok and it xe2 x80 x99s the first place we see the question of whether or not clinton can be found as xe2 x80 x9cgrossly negligent xe2 x80 x9d in the handling of classified intel nremember strzok is widely credited as the man who changed fbi director comey xe2 x80 x99s language on the clinton email investigation from the prosecutable xe2 x80 x9cgrossly negligent xe2 x80 x9d to the legally superflous xe2 x80 x9cextremely careless xe2 x80 x9d nat hotaircom john sexton explains the importance of this discovery nin the fbi memo you can already see the genesis of the distinction the fbi would rely on to clear clinton nstrzok writes that the media has been focused on the question of why hillary seems to be getting a pass when xe2 x80 x9cpetraeusbergerlibby xe2 x80 x9d did not nhe writes xe2 x80 x9cwe draw the distinction in noting we have no evidence classified information was ever shared with an unauthorized party ie nnotwithstanding the server setup we have not seen classified information shared with a member of the media an agent of a foreign power a lover etc xe2 x80 x9d in other words hillary may have been hacked but she didn xe2 x80 x99t intentionally give anything away nof course the statute itself didn xe2 x80 x99t make intent a prerequisite nherridge reports that the house committee memo once again raises this same issue xe2 x80 x9cofficials from both agencies have created a perception they misinterpreted the espionage act by stating secretary clinton lacked the requisite xe2 x80 x98intent xe2 x80 x99 for charges to be filed xe2 x80 x9d the memo says before pointing to statements by comey that indicated a belief that intent was required xe2 x80 x94 which the memo says ignored xe2 x80 x9cmeaningful aspects xe2 x80 x9d of the law nit really does seem that strzok an agent who had a personal prohillary bias was the person who pushed to let her off the hook by focusing on her intent rather than her negligence setting up the server in the first place ni fully believe ig horowitz xe2 x80 x99 findings here ni believe that he was unable to prove that there was any political motive to the fbi xe2 x80 x99s handling of the clinton email case and i believe that while the case was obviously mishandled it could have reached the conclusion it did honorably nhowever i also think that the ig has purposely left room in his conclusion to amend that decision after he xe2 x80 x99s concluded his russia investigation nin fact there are already signs of him doing that in this report nmuch of the information that he uses to chastise strzok xe2 x80 x99s behavior and judgment in the clinton email case would have actually come from his current investigation into the russia mess nit xe2 x80 x99s quite possible that as bad as this report is for comey strzok page and obama xe2 x80

interest in the qur xe2 x80 x99an among nonmuslims is to seek an answer to the question of whether or not it justifies and encourages islamic terrorism nwith what the qur xe2 x80 x99an meant and why it matters religion author garry wills is here to reassure us nwhat did the scripture of islam tell me about the duty to kill infidels nsome people are sure it is there though it isn xe2 x80 x99t nthen what does it say about shari xe2 x80 x99ah law nnot a thing p 7 nthat would be good to know were wills a reliable witness nunfortunately he proves to be just the opposite wills laments xe2 x80 x9crobert spencer of jihad watch calling for a ban on the qur xe2 x80 x99an xe2 x80 x9d p 58 ni have never called for such a ban and oppose in principle the banning of any book nwills not surprisingly does not offer any quotation from me to back up his false claim nhis manifest unreliability on this point casts a shadow on his primary assertions about the qur xe2 x80 x99an nwills seems determined to put the best possible face on the qur xe2 x80 x99an which requires him to ignore a great deal of qur xe2 x80 x99anic incitement and hatred nfor example he quotes 551  xe2 x80 x9cyou who believe do not take the jews and christians as allies xe2 x80 x9d p 114  but he nonetheless concludes after ten pages of tu quoque arguments and other legerdemain that xe2 x80 x9cthe qur xe2 x80 x99an is fraternal in its treatment of other faiths xe2 x80 x9d p 124 nwills never mentions qur xe2 x80 x99an 929 which commands muslims to wage war against jews and christians and subjugate them as inferiors under the rule of sharia nwills is no more trustworthy when he deals with the question of violence in the qur xe2 x80 x99an nhe renders one key passage in this way xe2 x80 x9cfight then until there is no more persecution and worship at the shrine is devoted to god xe2 x80 x9d 2193 p 133 nwhence the bracketed interpolation xe2 x80 x9cat the shrine xe2 x80 x9d nwills doesn xe2 x80 x99t give any source for it apparently it comes from none other than garry wills himself nby adding xe2 x80 x9cat the shrine xe2 x80 x9d to this verse wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the sacred mosque in mecca nhe ignores the fact that some islamic authorities see this passage as calling for nothing less than unlimited warfare against nonmuslims nthe prominent twentieth century indian islamic scholar muhammad ashiq ilahi bulandshahri explains the passage this way nthe worst of sins are infidelity  kufr and polytheism  shirk which constitute rebellion against allah the creator nto eradicate these muslims are required to wage war until there exists none of it in the world and the only religion is that of allah nwills doesn xe2 x80 x99t mention the existence of such interpretations even to dismiss them nlikewise when he claims that the qur xe2 x80 x99an has xe2 x80 x9cnot a thing xe2 x80 x9d to say about sharia he appears unaware that the qur xe2 x80 x99an is one of the sources of sharia nthe qur xe2 x80 x99an xe2 x80 x99s declarations that a woman xe2 x80 x99s testimony is worth half that of a man xe2 x80 x99s 2282 that a daughter is to receive a smaller part of an inheritance than a son receives 411 that thieves are to have their hands amputated 538 and that those who xe2 x80 x9cwage war against allah and his messenger xe2 x80 x9d are to be crucified or have a hand and foot amputated on opposite sides 533 are part of sharia in all its various expressions nbecause these stipulations are found in the qur xe2 x80 x99an they cannot be questioned or set aside nthroughout his book wills xe2 x80 x99 assurances that the qur xe2 x80 x99an is not really as bad as xe2 x80 x9crightwing islamophobes xe2 x80 x9d say or that the bible contains material that is just as bad or worse dissolve under close scrutiny nagain and again it turns out that wills has ignored key passages in order to make his case nhe asks why the qur xe2 x80 x99an is xe2 x80 x9cso ferocious to xe2 x80 x98hypocrites xe2 x80 x99 and apostates xe2 x80 x9d p 124 nthen he offers a quotation from the new testament letter to the hebrews saying that xe2 x80 x9cif we sin again on purpose xe2 x80 x9d there is xe2 x80 x9conly a terrifying judgment to come xe2 x80 x9d p 126 nwills concludes xe2 x80 x9cthe qur xe2 x80 x99an is not as absolute as this because it always leaves room for god xe2 x80 x99s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness xe2 x80 x9d p 126 nthat sounds wonderful and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the qur xe2 x80 x99an is more merciful than the new testament nuntil one realizes that in his discussion of apostasy in the qur xe2 x80 x99an wills has omitted all mention of the primary qur xe2 x80 x99anic passage on this topic ntake our poll

245,the obama era jade helm connection to the current illegal immigration policy n non the surface the latest illegal immigration debate between leftists and the administration looks like yet another issue progressives are trying to undermine progress being done by the president nno one should be surprised by the crackdown on illegals entering the country especially since it was one of the major campaign promises donald trump made before getting elected nwhen it comes to the separation of children from their families there is nothing new today that was not being done during the obama reign nin 2013 obama began bringing into the us literally over a hundred thousand people mainly below age 21 nthey were bused flown and met at the us border with mexico by the department of homeland security under the direction of obama to do so nsince most of them were adolescents and older teenagers they could not be set free thus obama ordered various military bases to house these children

terms of use nthe surge of children into the us from various countries south of the border was said to be the result of economics high crime rates and actual threats from organized crime entities nanother excuse used by the obama government was to bring them here to find their families already in the us nthus the idea that separating children from their parents as being something new done only by the trump administration is absurd since we really have no idea whether the children brought here during the obama reign were intentionally separated from their parents by the us government at that time or not nwe have only what little information the government told us then which was not very much considering the fact that obama wanted to keep as much of this situation as secret as possible nwhat many do not realize is today policy of separating underage siblings from their parents once they cross the border illegally into the us seems to be a planned event by the us government going all the way back to the domestic military exercises known as jade helm in 2015 nmany remember the military taking over several walmart locations mainly in texas during the jade helm exercises nthis along with the federal government grab of millions of acres of land during the obama years speaks volumes in the government plan to be able to handle millions of people nsince obama planned to have over a million muslim refugees brought into the us over a short period of time along with the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants coming in one can understand the reason the feds had to have the walmart stores and so much land as they needed housing for the millions they planned to bring in ndespite president trump signing an executive order suspending syrian refugees from entering the us for 120 days on jan 26 2017 while security measures were reviewed the us still imported 110000 refugees from syria and various other countries into the us in 2017 alone up from 85000 the previous year nthese numbers follow obama projections of the expected amount of refugees permitted to come to the us nof course as with the number of illegal immigrants entering our county the feds downplay the actual number which always ends up to be more than quadruple their stated number nwhat we seem to have here with the illegal immigration situation today is some very good actors on the left accusing the trump administration of being cruel and insensitive with separating children from their families once they cross the mexican border into the us nwhen in fact their idol obama did the same thing for years during his time in power nwhat they do not want to admit to is the fact that today illegal immigration picture is one that follows the obama plan on dealing with the influx of illegals to a carbon copy npresident trump on the other hand is following along with it by detaining illegal immigrants at the border and separating children from their apparent families nsince no one can know if the children really belong to the illegals who say they are their parents they are separated until that can be verified along with other background findings nthe bottom line is both the left and the trump administration seem to be following along with a plan of action going back to jade helm which paved the way for the housing needed for such a huge influx of illegal immigrants and refugees nall of which seems to be a planned event nin any case neither side in dc is really interested in solving the illegal immigration problem or cares about the children involved nif they were there would be no detention and separation after illegally coming into the us only an immediate deportation by us border patrol on the spot n,"['repetition', 'loaded_language', 'doubt', 'name_calling', 'labeling']"

settlement xe2 x80 x9d he continued xe2 x80 x9cthe government will draft and pursue regulatory amendments that eliminate itar control over the technical information at the center of this case nthey

better inform the public about the consequences of gun control nwhat does all this mean nwell it  pretty simple and i highly recommend the wired article which is quite lengthy and has lots of information but what this does is demonstrates that the genie is out of the bottle and there is just no way for gun grabbing communists the world over to be able to truly enforce their unlawful acts of fun gun confiscation nwhy nbecause now anyone with access to the internet and a 3d printer can print their very own gun that is unregistered nthat  right and it  perfectly legal to do so nand we aren t just talking a rigid looking oneshot handgun nwe re talking ars 1911s and a host of other guns nthis actually may end up undermining the gun manufacturing industry in the future as people will be able to build their own guns at home in a similar manner to how the internet has had a dramatic effect on the retail brick and mortar stores nwilson boasted that his efforts have officially killed gun control ni barely put a million bucks into this and i got you the second amendment forever he told the daily wire in a phone interview nwhat has the nra done for you lately ni don t know that i would go quite that far after all the settlement does state that the government expressly acknowledges that nonautomatic firearms up to 50caliber xe2 x80 x93 including modern semiauto sporting rifles such as the popular ar15 and similar firearms xe2 x80 x93 are not inherently military ntherefore the government still believes it has a right to regulate certain arms which it does not have authority

two key facts in this statement nfirst the very people who have been loudest in attacking president trump about his performance at the helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect america from russian meddling in 2016 nthe very intensity and nastiness of former cia director brennan and former director of national intelligence clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect america nit was their duty in 2016 xe2 x80 x93 not candidate trump xe2 x80 x99s nsecond the trump administration has been far tougher on russia than president obama ever dreamed of being nthe trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken russia and force putin to change his aggressive behavior nthe trump administration has levied tough sanctions on russia nalso president trump xe2 x80 x99s public lecture about germany not buying natural gas from russia was aimed at cutting putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the russian economy nfurthermore president trump xe2 x80 x99s efforts to get our european allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on putin nthe stronger nato is the less maneuvering room russia has nbeyond pressuring our allies consider these specific steps president trump has taken against russia nwhere president obama refused to provide serious weapons to the ukrainians to help them defend themselves his response was weakness on a pathetic scale president trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the ukrainians to increase the cost of russian aggression nwhen the russians used chemical weapons in great britain president trump joined our allies and expelled 60 russian intelligence officers from the united states nwhen the russians retaliated the trump administration closed the russian consulate in seattle npresident trump had previously shuttered the russian consulate in san francisco and smaller annexes in washington and new york nmore than 100 russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons ndespite the hysteria of the left it is impossible to see the trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with russia nnothing done in helsinki made life easier for the putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime nfinally a brief word about the strong language and vicious comments about the president nwe are in the early stages of a cultural civil war in which the left sees itself losing nthis is what led me to write my new new york times bestselling book xe2 x80 x9ctrump xe2 x80 x99s america the truth about our nation xe2 x80 x99s great comeback xe2 x80 x9d with each passing month the radicalextremist wing of the democratic party dominates the progressive wing more and more nwith president trump xe2 x80 x99s nomination of judge brett kavanaugh to the supreme court it was clear that anyone trump nominated was going to be attacked nin fact the demonstrators protesting the nomination had signs for all four of the finalists and were instantly ready to oppose the president regardless of his choice nsimilarly obamaera national security officials seem determined to use the harshest possible language to attack president trump ni think their strong words and hysteria are driven by their own guilt nwhatever the russians did they did while brennan was director of the cia clapper was director of national intelligence and james comey was head of the federal bureau of investigation nthese former officials attack trump ferociously to hide their own failure and their own guilt njust keep that in mind the next time you see one of them on tv nmy prediction is that president trump will remain tough on russia and the helsinki press conference will be seen as the aberration it was n,"['black-and-white_fallacy', 'repetition', 'loaded_language', 'slogans', 'flag-waving', 'causal_oversimplification',

nif this be treason make the most of it n xe2 x80 x93patrick henry nrecently i received a newspaper article from a confused biblically illiterate friend asking me what my take was on an article titled xe2 x80 x9cscripture teaches to submit to authorities xe2 x80 x9d with reference to romans chapter 13 nin this article the author was calling out a christian for protesting a corrupt representative in government even going so far as to suggest this protestant ought to have stayed home to read their bible rather than to protest corruption in government nhe went onto say that we are commanded by scripture to submit to the authorities that have been elected nto start off maybe this individual should take the time to know a little bit of his own history nthere is nothing worse than when a person who doesn xe2 x80 x99t know what they are talking about tries to tell you what the truth is ntake our poll  story continues below nwill brett kavanaugh be confirmed to the supreme court nwill

document alone is 75 of the usurpations that the tyrant king george committed against our forefathers and what it is that our forefathers would not put up with nour american history found in that document teaches that our forefathers threw off the tyrant that would not be ruled by god and declared xe2 x80 x9cresistance to tyrants is obedience to god nfurthermore the motto of the american revolution was xe2 x80 x9cno king but king jesus xe2 x80 x9d america xe2 x80 x99s original national seal was xe2 x80 x9crebellion to tyrants is obedience to god xe2 x80 x9d with a picture on the

the tyrant king george feared the most nthe black robed regiment were in fact the preachers that went before the forefathers in educating the colonies to resistance when it came to the corrupt king on the other side of the pond nthey sacrificed themselves to establish the freedoms in which he enjoys today nthe author went on to write that this protestant should know what the bible says about those in authority nfirst of all the authority given to our representative government is derived from xe2 x80 x9cwe the people xe2 x80 x9d nwe receive our rights from god and in turn delegate power to those who serve xe2 x80 x9cwe the people xe2 x80 x9d nrepresentatives work for us we do not work for them n xe2 x80 x9cthey are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights xe2 x80 xa6 governments are instituted among men deriving their powers from the consent of the governed xe2 x80 x9d the declaration of independence nhe then quotes romans 13 17 nlet every soul be subject unto the higher powers nfor there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god nwhosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation nfor rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil nwilt thou then not be afraid of the power ndo that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same nfor he is the minister of god to thee for good nbut if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil nwherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake nfor for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are god  ministers attending continually upon this very thing nrender therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour nthe first scripture says nlet every soul be subject unto the higher powers nfor there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god ngod ordained the power and that xe2 x80 x9crulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil ndid god tell his church to submit to that which he condemns ndeuteronomy 251 proverbs 1715 absolutely not nis the church to transgress his laws or to magnify and enforce his laws unto judgment npsalm 408 romans 331 of

fact commanded nowhere in scripture for the church to submit to the wicked nthe bible teaches just the exact opposite nwe are to xe2 x80 x9chave no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove expose them xe2 x80 x9d ephesians 511 nfurthermore it would contradict what scripture teaches us from genesis all the way to revelation every step of the way nthink of this those that

those who lie continuously to them that steal and even kill nabsolutely not nsubmit to what god condemns nyet this is what the perverse modernday professing christians are teaching the sheep in the american church today nit would do you well to now look to the christ when he said that we are to beware of the leaven of the pharisee xe2 x80 x99s corrupt doctrines of those who claimed to be the children of god as well as the leaven of herod corrupt doctrines of government mark 815 nif you remember it was those same people who called for the crucifixion of christ while crying out xe2 x80 x9cwe have no king but caesar xe2 x80 x9d john 1915 ndo these that teach such heresy not realize that every apostle except john was killed by hostile corrupt civil authorities opposed to their endeavors nchristians throughout history were imprisoned tortured or killed by corrupt civil authorities of all stripes for refusing to submit to their various lawless policies and prohibitions ndid christian martyrs violate god xe2 x80 x99s principles of submission to authority nof course not nalso keep in mind that magistrates have limited and defined authority in civil matters ntake note that civil government is to be and must be a xe2 x80 x9cterror to good works xe2 x80 x9d it has no power or authority to terrorize good works or good lawabiding people ngod never gave them that authority and any and all government that oversteps the divine authority and its boundaries has no divine authority or protection ncivil government is a xe2 x80 x9cminister for god to thee for good xe2 x80 x9d romans 134 nit is not a minister of god for evil ncivil magistrates have a divine duty to xe2 x80 x9cexecute wrath upon him that doeth evil xe2 x80 x9d anyone who teaches that they have authority to execute wrath upon him that doeth good xe2 x80 x9d is ignorant and uneducated in their misleadings 1 john 46 nto tell christians to submit to evil civil authority is teaching the opposite of what is true ncommon sense does come into play here ni ask did moses violate god  principle of submission when he was commanded by god xe2 x80 x9cgo in unto pharaoh and tell him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me xe2 x80 x9d exodus 91 nand when pharaoh refused god plagued the pharaoh and the egyptians and set his children free nthink of this the meekest man alive was sent to the face of the pharaoh to tell him to obey or else nis this what is being preached from the pulpits across america today nor what of gideon who was to deliver the children of israel from the midianites nthe first thing the lord commanded him to do was to tear down his father  altars judges 625 nwas this a violation of god  principles of submission nthe sins of the fathers were the reason the midianites had power to oppress them nwhat of that lone prophet elijah nthe tyrant ahab called him the troubler of israel nelijah set the record straight when he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy father  house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou hast followed baalim 1 kings 1818 nis this a violation of god  principles when it came to submission to authority nelijah took ahab and the false prophets to the top of mount carmel where the god of israel consumed the sacrifice by fire and the false prophets were killed 1 kings 183840 nwhat of king david nwas he violating god xe2 x80 x99s principles of submission when he refused to surrender himself to saul xe2 x80 x99s troops ndavid was a king that was to overthrow corrupt governments by dispossessing them and establishing righteousness through justice and judgment jeremiah 235 isaiah 514 ndid shadrach meshach and abednego violate god  principle of submission when they refused to worship king nebuchadnezzar xe2 x80 x99s image nthen the princes the governors and captains the judges the treasurers the counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that nebuchadnezzar had set up nthen an herald cried aloud to you it is commanded o people nations and languages nthat at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up nand whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace ndaniel 336 nwhen they refused to submit to the tyrant the furnace was heated up 7 times hotter so that the guards were consumed only to have the fourth man xe2 x80 x9clike the son of man xe2 x80 x9d show up to deliver them where the fire had no power over them and not a hair of their heads was singed nin the end only the corrupt king acknowledges the god of shadrach meshach and abednego n xe2 x80 x9cblessed be the god of shadrach meshach and abednego who hath sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the king  word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own god xe2 x80 x9d daniel 328 ndid daniel violate god  principles of submission when he disobeyed the king  order to stop praying to any god but himself nkeep in mind that the punishment was that daniel was thrown into a den of lions in which god sent forth an angel to protect him nhis accusers were then thrown into the den and devoured by the very lions that they meant to have devoured daniel daniel 6 nwhat of jeremiah nwas he violating god  principles of submission when he was sent to preach repentance to the corrupt church and the corrupt kings nfor behold i have made thee this day a defenced city and an iron pillar and brasen walls against the whole land against the kings of judah against the princes thereof against the priests thereof and against the people of the land njeremiah 118 ndon xe2 x80 x99t forget about amos who was prophesying judgment upon the corrupt priests and the corrupt king of his day amos 71016 nwas that violating or fulfilling god  principles and purposes nwhat of the new testament njohn the baptist points out all of the evils of king herod luke 319 nwas this a violation of submission to civil government nno it was a rebuke to corruption in government to submit to the god of abraham isaac and jacob and his laws nis it a violation of submission to god  principles to keep preaching xe2 x80 x9crepent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d nabsolutely not nthe corrupt pharisees along with corrupt government did the opposite n xe2 x80 x9cbeing grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead nand they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the next day for it was now eventide nhowbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand nand it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes and annas the high priest and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem nand when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have ye done this nthen peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel nif we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole nbe it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole nthis is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner nneither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved nnow when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus nand beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it nbut when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves nsaying what shall we do to these men nfor that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it nbut that it spread no further among the people let us straitly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name nand they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus nbut peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye nfor we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard xe2 x80 x9d acts 4220 nor what of the account found in acts 12111 where the lord sent an angel to liberate peter from the hands of tyrants n xe2 x80 x9cnow about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church nand he killed james the brother of john with the sword nand because he saw it pleased the jews he proceeded further to take peter also nthen were the days of unleavened bread nand when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after easter to bring him forth to the people npeter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him nand when herod would have brought him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison nand behold the angel of the lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and he smote peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly nand his chains fell off from his hands nand the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals nand so he did nand he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me nand he went out and followed him and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision nwhen they were past the first and the second ward they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and forthwith the angel departed from him nand when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a surety that the lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews xe2 x80 x9d nover and over again you can see that the church was to stand in protest against the wicked that were at war with christ revelation 1217 in dealing with not only the corrupt and wicked priests but also the corrupt and wicked in government nas well as those who submitted to such nit is important for people to know the scriptures history lest you find yourselves to be fighting against god acts 539 nnowhere in scripture can you find the lord telling his children to submit to the wicked in disobedience to his word nnowhere nfurthermore the individual that wrote the article teaching people to submit to authorities might want to take the time to read romans 1221 before perverting and twisting romans 13 so that the next time he will not be guilty of twisting scripture the way that satan twists scripture n xe2 x80 x9cbe not overcome

njames larkin getting the boot in dublin for upholding catholic teaching on abortion xe2 x80 xa6 i know some people are to put it bluntly freaking out nthe anger of the laity over the mccarrick situation is boiling over into the twitter feed of the people we still call xe2 x80 x9cthe good bishops xe2 x80 x9d nbishop thomas tobin of providence ri  nicknamed the xe2 x80 x9cgood tobin xe2 x80 x9d in contrast to the xe2 x80 x9cbad tobin xe2 x80 x9d and franciscardinal joseph tobin of newark xe2 x80 x93 got quite an earful when he tweeted the other day xe2 x80 x9cdespite the egregious offenses of a few and despite the faults and sins we all have i xe2 x80 x99m very proud of my brother bishops and i admire and applaud the great work they do everyday for christ and his church xe2 x80 x9d nthe replies haven xe2 x80 x99t topped out yet at 121 nearly all of them expressing outrage at this cavalier attitude toward the revelation that cardinal mccarrick has been proven to be a lifelong homosexual rapist and sexual predator grooming and trapping young men and children into unwanted sexual contact and that nearly the entire episcopate of the united states either colluded directly or kept quiet about it nit xe2 x80 x99s clear that even the xe2 x80 x9cgood bishops xe2 x80 x9d have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs nas i wrote elsewhere since 2002 most catholics know perfectly well despite the lame whitewashing attempt that xe2 x80 x9cthe us bishops gave themselves a pass xe2 x80 x9d on clerical sex abuse with the dallas charter xe2 x80 x9ca thing that brazenly shifted blame xe2 x80 x9d and it seems that though they xe2 x80 x99re still doing this quite a few lay catholics just aren xe2 x80 x99t having it nwe are seeing the final slide the expected and inevitable result of the last 100 years nthe church was infiltrated we know this in the 19th century by some pretty dark forces and they have finally come into the ascendancy and are showing themselves quite clearly for what they are nthe mccarrick news xe2 x80 x93 and all the stuff swirling around it like the latest about bishop pineda and his connection to pope francis through cardinal maradiaga xe2 x80 x93 has not come in contrast to this but as an intrinsic part of it nthe scandal of mccarrick is simply a toxic emission a venting of the gasses that build up naturally around any rotting thing nrod dreher1 is doing excellent work compiling testimony from priests and others saying out loud at last what many of us had known for many years about mccarrick and his gang nit has shown the world what traditionalists have known that it is emphatically not the result of one xe2 x80 x9cbad apple xe2 x80 x9d or even only a xe2 x80 x9cfew xe2 x80 x9d as the hapless xe2 x80 x9cconservative xe2 x80 x9d bishop tobin tried to claim on twitter nthis is the result of a masscollusion nas our friend steve skojec put it the other day xe2 x80 x9cwe xe2 x80 x99ve got to stop pretending it xe2 x80 x99s just the progressive element in the church nthe xe2 x80 x98conservatives xe2 x80 x99 are complicit too xe2 x80 x9d in short as it was during his days of glory globe trotting on the dime of the state department hosting presidents for dinner and inviting john paul ii and mother theresa to tea so it is now mccarrick is the face of the new paradigm nwhether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the caymans it will remain true mccarrick is the xe2 x80 x9cnew church xe2 x80 x9d na point that dreher xe2 x80 x99s informants have brought up needs to be made emphatic the homosexualist cabal that is currently reported to be dominant in the catholic hierarchy and don xe2 x80 x99t imagine this is confined to the united states or even to the english speaking world have a well documented methodology of mutual protectionandthreat that keeps the whole apparatus afloat nin briefest and simplest possible terms immoral or even illegal sexual activity is preferred because it leaves a man open to blackmail to control through fear of exposure2 nwhen that blackmailing culture becomes ascendant it will always reject the morally upright as too dangerous too difficult to control nthis is why faithful seminarians are rejected and why faithful priests are harassed nas dreher reported nwhen predatory gay priests run seminaries they select on a bias for gay candidates ngay seminarians who intend to be celibate sipe said face tremendous pressure to have sex nif they slip up even once their failure will be noted and shared xe2 x80 xa6 and they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered nlater as a priest predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles nwhen i was covering the scandal in the early 2000s i spoke to several unconnected heterosexual men xe2 x80 x94 priests former priests seminarians xe2 x80 x94 who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners so that they too would be complicit in sexual secretkeeping and therefore no longer be a potential danger nnothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt nfor many priests one might say all good priests this is not a sustainable situation to say the least ni xe2 x80 x99ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it nhow are they to continue to offer the sacraments in this situation nwhere are they to live nhow are they to maintain themselves nthese are the priests who did make it through this institutional gauntlet who remain faithful now but are still under the control of these often grossly corrupt and evil men nas men known to be incorruptible themselves there is a big target painted on their backs nin short not only can a bad bishop harry a man out of his ministry he has complete control over the priest xe2 x80 x99s material life nthe bishop can with the flick of a pen or a single phone call render a priest homeless penniless and jobless nand these remember are men often well on in years whose only education and employment training has likely been academic degrees in philosophy and theology and whose only professional contacts are ecclesiastical nmoreover because of the globalisation of the bishopnetwork a man blackballed for his authentic catholicity will be a pariah in every diocese in the world nand with the advent of bergoglio in rome there are no more havens as many of the former franciscan friars of the immaculate have learned the blackballing has gone global with this pontificate nhe will remain a pariah even among the socalled xe2 x80 x9cgood xe2 x80 x9d bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal xe2 x80 xa6 see above re mccarrick  president bushjohn paul ii ni have been hearing from priests who are saying in effect xe2 x80 x9cwe xe2 x80 x99re trapped in this situation and forced to remain silent because if we don xe2 x80 x99t we xe2 x80 x99ll not only be unable to function as priests but we xe2 x80 x99ll be homeless and penniless nwe xe2 x80 x99re unemployable in any other field xe2 x80 x9d and as much as we might be tempted to say xe2 x80 x9cwell suck it up this is for the good of souls xe2 x80 x9d the reality is that these are not small considerations nmany priests are getting older xe2 x80 x93 many of them with health issues xe2 x80 x93 and a man who has already given 20 or 30 years of his life to the church is faced with a practical impossibility if he finds himself blacklisted nof course there are some who don xe2 x80 x99t fit this mould there are a lot of second careers in the priesthood and plenty of people go into seminary after some years in the normal workforce and can go back to it at need nsome of the men now coming forward with complaints against mccarrick who left the priesthood over their experiences have gone on to have normal healthy working lives nbut i think honestly most priests are in this corner and they know it and so do their bishops ni think a young man goes forward in great faith spends ten to fifteen years studying philosophy and theology  fields that have almost no application in the workforce outside academia or the church  with the honest and frankly fair expectation of a lifetime of employment and a safety net at the end nas one of them said to me xe2 x80 x9cthe old arrangement was xe2 x80 x98remain faithful do the work and we will look after you nwe xe2 x80 x99ll house feed and clothe you and look after your retirement xe2 x80 x99 the new arrangement is a perversion of that xe2 x80 x98keep quiet and go along with it all and you xe2 x80 x99ll be fine but step an inch out of line and we xe2 x80 x99ll destroy you xe2 x80 x99 xe2 x80 x9d nso what do we do nthe old paradigm is destroyed and going along with the new paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else nas we saw in ireland this week the purge has started nit xe2 x80 x99s not enough to simply demand that a priest continue in his ministry no matter what nwe need to start working together with faithful priests xe2 x80 x93 while there still are some xe2 x80 x93 to help them create practical material alternatives nif we who still love the church want priests to be faithful and even to start denouncing the evil and corruption they see we are going to have to help them create a modicum of independence and security in which to do it nthe other day the american conservative writer john zmirak wrote a sound suggestion on twitter that i think it xe2 x80 x99s time we all started taking seriously nin response to the continued outrages of both xe2 x80 x9cgood xe2 x80 x9d and bad bishops zmirak suggested establishing xe2 x80 x9can escrow fund in each scandalplagued diocese where laymen can deposit the funds they would have donated to the local church until a new bishop is appointed xe2 x80 x9d ni responded xe2 x80 x9cand the money could be used to purchase properties to house faithful priests punished by their bishops for refusing the new paradigm nwe could even perhaps buy a few convents so contemplative nuns could continue to pray in peace without harassment from the evil men in rome xe2 x80 x9d ni am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures to ensure that the authentic catholic life can be maintained through what is obviously soon to be a general collapse of the institution nthis would mean independent nonprofit foundations that could build or buy church buildings convents and even schools and provide salaries for priests and other staff ni started thinking about this recently when i received a note from a reader with a link to an online petition from germany addressed to the german bishops  n xe2 x80 x9cbegging xe2 x80 x9d those manifestly evil and apostate men not to close a famous and ancient monastic house ni responded that this was going about things the wrong way ncatholics are going to have to get their heads out of the mindset that they are helpless petitioners xe2 x80 x9cbegging xe2 x80 x9d the hierarchy to maintain the faith nfirst of all it only gives them a frisson of pleasure to see us groveling and begging for mercy nlet xe2 x80 x99s not give them that ok nthere xe2 x80 x99s already enough xe2 x80 x9cfrissons of pleasure xe2 x80 x9d in their lives nsecond it xe2 x80 x99s simply not going to work nin germany in the us in canada in italy in britain xe2 x80 xa6 throughout the church in the 1st world and in much of it elsewhere the men in charge of the xe2 x80 x9cinstitutional church xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x93 that is whose names are on the bank accounts xe2 x80 x93 are dedicated to the destruction of everything we want to preserve nthe wolves are now looking with ravening eyes at the faithful nthey are in short our enemies nthey xe2 x80 x99ve become so by making themselves the enemies of christ and his holy church nthey know it and it xe2 x80 x99s time we stopped imagining otherwise nthe other suggestion i have is for young men interested in the priesthood to fortify themselves not only spiritually but in the material sphere nthere xe2 x80 x99s one big vulnerability we can guard against pretty easily nno one should be facing penury and permanent unemployment because he xe2 x80 x99s a faithful catholic nwe should never be letting any young man go into any diocesan seminary without being a property owner nhe should own a house or stand to inherit one nfamilies have to come to see this as a duty to the child and to the church nand more than that the potential priest needs to have job skills that have nothing to do with the priesthood namong the working classes there is a bias against intellectual work nbut most working class people have a pretty sensible attitude towards ambitions in academia get something under your belt you can fall back on nhow many philosophy phds can build himself a bookshelf nchange the oil in a car nrewire a house nthe standard clich xc3 xa9 of young people with useless academic degrees working at starbucks has become so common it xe2 x80 x99s not even worth memeing anymore nhow many young men do we foresee being forced out of seminary for having the wrong xe2 x80 x9csexual orientation xe2 x80 x9d nevery one of those guys needs to be able to snap his fingers in the face of the rector and walk straight into a decent job based not on any recommendation from a corrupt bishop but on his solid skills namong the white collar classes there is a bias against blue collar work but the trades are crying out for skilled men and a trade school diploma in fixing tractors is a lot cheaper and a lot faster to get than a university degree nthat xe2 x80 x99s an economic asset that we can xe2 x80 x99t afford to turn up our welleducated noses at ndont miss hilary white next article in the july 31 print edition of the remnant newspaper subscribe today n n nit reminds me of a discussion i had some years ago with the prior of a benedictine monastery that is attracting a lot of young vocations none kid wanted to join and told me they had recommended he go to some college or other to study philosophy first nthis college apparently waives much of the tuition and gives work studies to people going for the priesthood and religious life so they can avoid the student loan trap nthis is fine good idea nbut i asked him what he knew how to do n xe2 x80 x9ccan you fix a bathroom pipe ndo you know anything about what to feed a sheep or how to care for a cow ncan you drive a tractor xe2 x80 x9d this nice kid who certainly does have a vocation could read books and look things up on the internet and write a pretty mean paper on thomas aquinas but not a lot else nthere is going to have to be a shift in attitude in our remaining faithful institutions ndoes a monastery really need all of its members to have phds in philosophy and theology nwouldn xe2 x80 x99t it also be useful to have an electrician a plumber a carpenter a cook someone who knows how to fix a car or a tractor nor for that matter a certified accountant or an investment banker nif you insist on having people with degrees maybe a degree in agriculture would be a good fit for a big monastic foundation with a lot of land like say clear creek or that new carmelite place in nebraska ni think this is the time we are going to have to start overcoming our class snobbery nyoung men with ambitions for the priesthood are going to have to tuck away employability and an independent financial foundation in the same way people used to tuck money away against a rainy day nsimply put they xe2 x80 x99ve got to stop being materially dependent on the hierarchy nthis vulnerability is a gun to their heads in this time nthe next kid who says anything to me about wanting to enter the diocesan priesthood i xe2 x80 x99m going to ask xe2 x80 x9chow sound is your investment portfolio xe2 x80 x9d the next candidate for religious life i xe2 x80 x99ll ask xe2 x80 x9cgreat nwhat xe2 x80 x99s your trade nwhat do you have to fall back on xe2 x80 x9d ni xe2 x80 x99m given to understand that some houses of the congregation of the oratory ask candidates to come with an independent income which given what we xe2 x80 x99re seeing elsewhere doesn xe2 x80 x99t sound like a bad idea nperhaps catholic financial advisors could be encouraged to set up a programme to teach young men how to create a sound financial footing with investments nmeanwhile we must refocus our energy on the faith itself instead of the physical and even canonical structures that house it nthat monastery in germany is lost nthose bishops want the property and they xe2 x80 x99ll get it nwhat the group of laymen should be doing instead of petitioning that it be saved is finding a place where the nuns can live their charism of religious life without episcopal harassment nbishops won xe2 x80 x99t protect and support good priests nthen it xe2 x80 x99s up to us nthe vatican wants to force all religious congregations into the pantswearing marxist antinun lcwr pattern nwe xe2 x80 x99re not helpless nwe start buying convent buildings and start a fund to support the nunrefugees nour goal must be preserving the precious treasure the deposit of the faith the sacramental life the great charisms and artifacts of the religious life ni am reminded of what the curators of the hermitage museum in st petersburg did in the face of the advancing german army nthey took down packed up and hid the art treasures some of the greatest in the world nover a million precious works of art were sent on trains to be hidden in the urals ntwo trains got away to safety but one was still there when the germans surrounded the city and began the siege nthe museum xe2 x80 x99s website tells us n xe2 x80 x9cdespite starvation and severely cold temperatures the museum continued its preservational functions nwith only a skeleton staff left behind it was difficult to protect the vast buildings and their sumptuous interiors against snow wind and rain nequipped with firstaid kits wearing helmets and gloves the museum air wardens cleared away heaps of broken bricks and the remains of charred flooring after each bomb hit the building they helped dig out the living and the dead and bandage the wounded after raids in the surrounding area ntwelve airraid shelters were fitted out in the basements of the museum complex and until the first evacuations were made in march 1942 there were 12000 people housed there permanently among them the museum director celebrated academician iosif orbeli xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9chermitage staff both in sverdlovsk and in leningrad acted as museum attendants continuing their scholarly activity and lecturing in hospitals holding conferences writing scholarly articles nno items were lost during the evacuation xe2 x80 x9d nto keep up everyone xe2 x80 x99s morale the museum staff while bombs were falling and they and their patrons were equally starving continued to give tours and lectures describing perfectly the artworks that had been removed nthey understood the value of what they had and did everything within their power to preserve and protect it ndoes this all sound a bit well schismatic nnot necessarily nany bishop who can demonstrate through his actions and not just with his tweets who can prove that he is still a catholic and not a wolf is welcome to join us nbut we xe2 x80 x99d be fools to wait for them nwhatever you might think of archbishop lefebvre xe2 x80 x99s solution over the last few decades it certainly seems inarguable that the xe2 x80 x9cstate of emergency xe2 x80 x9d for which he was preparing has come at last nand in a state of emergency certain norms are naturally suspended nthe simple fact is that soon there are going to be xe2 x80 x9cvagus xe2 x80 x9d priests who have been thrown out of their ministry for maintaining the faith nthere are going to be nuns and monks without homes as in the england of henry viii ni think it xe2 x80 x99s only reasonable that those who also want to maintain the faith should reach out to them and offer what shelter we can nwhat we have seen this week is making it clear that we can simply no longer sit back and xe2 x80 x9cbeg xe2 x80 x9d bishops to maintain and defend the faith nit xe2 x80 x99s not enough now to go into seminary or a monastery with glowing eyes and a firm faith nsentiment isn xe2 x80 x99t going to be much comfort when the young man is no longer so very young and finds himself standing on the street outside the chancery with no skills no money no job no health insurance and no prospects nif it is true that we really are alone in this then so be it nlet xe2 x80 x99s stop lamenting and start doing practical things about it n n1 dreher and others are asking some very important questions now about the activities of the men mccarrick is known to have mentored one of whom is currently making interesting headlines as pope francis xe2 x80 x99 cardinal prefect of the new dicastery for laity family and life and as the primary organiser of the upcoming world meeting of families in his native dublin nit should probably be noted that up to the time he left over a xe2 x80 x9cdifference of opinion xe2 x80 x9d with the group xe2 x80 x99s leadership cardinal kevin farrell as also deeply involved in the legionaries of christ nhe joined in 1966 was ordained in xe2 x80 x9978 and was quickly appointed to a highranking position as general director with responsibility for seminaries and schools of the legionaries of christ in italy spain and ireland until 1983 nthis period was at the peak of the power of the grotesquely corrupt fr nmaciel for whom it has been shown all the legion xe2 x80 x99s leadership was covering nthe farrell family xe2 x80 x99s involvement in the legion continues with his brother bishop brian farrell who ordained 20 new priests to the questionablebutofficiallyreformed community in 2015 na recent post to the official regnum christi website shows that cardinal kevin is still close enough to the legionrelated xe2 x80 x9clay xe2 x80 x9d organisation to hire dicastery staff from their ranks nafter he left the legion kevin farrell joined the diocesan clergy in washington dc and became a prot xc3 xa9g xc3 xa9 of the archbishop cardinal wuerl nso close is he to mccarrick that farrell xe2 x80 x99s coat of arms as elizabeth yore reported in these pages is not much more than a tribute to his belatedlydisgraced mentor nso someone in a journalistic capacity might want to be asking a few questions about these things too n2 it should also be noted that in his book the dictator pope historian henry sire documented that this is how jorge bergoglio has always operated collecting bad men around him and controlling them with a masterful combination of threats and rewards nthe natural question xe2 x80 x9cwhy does pope francis keep such bad men around him xe2 x80 x9d is now easy to answer n,"['appeal_to_fear-prejudice', 'loaded_language', 'slogans', 'flag-waving', 'thought-terminating_cliches', 'name_calling',

hardly quiet about it naccording to hersh mek members were trained in intercepting communications cryptography weaponry and small unit tactics at the nevada site until president barack obama took

history vietnam was started after the united states had been attacked in the gulf of tonkin in the south china sea nhowever over the past 54 years a deluge of information and government officials have come forward showing that most everything the government and the media told americans about the gulf of tonkin was a lie noften the american mainstream media becomes a de facto government employee taking the claims of us officials and reporting them as proven fact xe2 x80 x94 and nothing exemplifies this penchant better than reporting on the gulf of tonkin incident xe2 x80 x94 perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up as a justification for war naccording to the widely discredited official story on august 2 1964 the destroyer uss maddox while performing a signals intelligence

lyndon b johnson the authority to assist any southeast asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by xe2 x80 x9ccommunist aggression xe2 x80 x9d the resolution served as johnson xe2 x80 x99s legal justification for deploying us conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against north vietnam nas a result 58177 americans would lose their lives nadditionally over one million north and south vietnamese including 627000 civilians would be slaughtered nbut it wasn xe2 x80 x99t true nat all nin fact the gulf of tonkin incident as it became known turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in vietnam xe2 x80 x94 leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of us troops and millions of vietnamese fomenting the largest antiwar movement in american history and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world nthe truth of the matter was that the maddox was engaged in an aggressive intelligence gathering operation working hand in hand in coordinated attacks on north vietnam by the south vietnamese navy and the laotian air force nwhen the government announced that it had been the victim of an unprovoked attack xe2 x80 x94this was a lie nin the 2003 documentary the fog of war  the former united states secretary of defense robert s mcnamara admitted that the august

283,the death penalty instituted by god himself the biblical basis for catholic teaching on capital punishment n nto argue against the death penalty is to contend with constituted reality never since adam and eve committed the original sin every living creature is subject to it nevery one of us is born on death row and lives out his allotted lifespan in its shadow without hope of reprieve ngod made that clear when he told adam that xe2 x80 x9cin what day soever xe2 x80 x9d he preferred his own will above his creator xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9cthou shalt die the death xe2 x80 x9d condemning him sooner or later to xe2 x80 x9creturn to the earth out of which thou wast taken for dust thou art and to dust thou shalt return xe2 x80 x9d gen 319 nin other words there has always been a death penalty ngod instituted it and he was the first to impose it embedding it in the very fabric of natural law nwhen cain took it upon himself to inflict death on his brother abel xe2 x80 x9cin the field xe2 x80 x9d he soon learned that god furthermore reserved the exercise of this right to himself alone ncain is told xe2 x80 x9cwhat hast thou done nthe voice of thy brother xe2 x80 x99s blood crieth to me from the earth xe2 x80 x9d and god curses him for his presumption by dooming him to homelessness and unproductive labor nwhen cain complains that being a xe2 x80 x9cvagabond  n n non the earth every one therefore that findeth me shall kill me xe2 x80 x9d god laid down that xe2 x80 x9cwhoever shall kill cain shall be punished sevenfold xe2 x80 x9d setting a mysterious identifying mark on him to protect him from the vengeance of others nthe fifth commandment later delivered to moses xe2 x80 x9cthou shalt not kill xe2 x80 x9d therefore dates from adamic times when it operated as god xe2 x80 x99s exclusive prerogative allowing no exceptions n nalthough men certainly continued to kill one another in a society which in fact became so wicked that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times they did so as murderers outside god  law without legal right nonly after the flood when noah and his sons set about repopulating the earth did god delegate to human society his exclusive authority to impose the death penalty for just cause nhe told noah xe2 x80 x9cfor i will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast and at the hand of man at the hand of every man and of his brother will i require the life of man nwhosoever shall shed man xe2 x80 x99s blood his blood shall be shed for man was made to the image of god xe2 x80 x9d in other words from that point in history lawful killing in atonement for taking the life of another is sanctioned by god n nafter the great theophany on sinai moses codified the death penalty as part of the old law of talion which in strict justice required xe2 x80 x9clife for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot xe2 x80 x9d deut n1921 nthe supreme penalty was imposed not only for murder but for many other serious offenses for adultery rape sodomy kidnapping for striking or cursing parents for sacrificing a child to moloch nidolatry fortunetelling acting as a medium preaching apostasy or attempting in any way to entice another from the faith were also punishable by death as was blasphemy an offense considered so heinous that the law specified xe2 x80 x9che that blasphemeth the name of the lord dying let him die all the multitude shall stone him whether he be a native or a stranger xe2 x80 x9d lev n2416 ndeath was also decreed for refusing to accept the decision of the priests in a legal case and an incorrigible son could be put to death on the testimony of his parents before the proper court n na priest xe2 x80 x99s daughter convicted of fornication was burned to death lev n219 but usually the sentence was carried out by stoning in which the whole community took part as evidence that no private parties were authorized to execute a criminal but only society as a whole after due judgment neveryone was furthermore responsible for the atonement due to god for a crime whose evil consequences would otherwise have affected them all xe2 x80 x9cthe hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people that thou mayest take away the evil out of the midst of thee xe2 x80 x9d deut n177 nthe law read xe2 x80 x9cdefile not the land of your habitation which is stained with the blood of the innocent neither can it otherwise be expiated but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another xe2 x80 x9d num n3533 n nin order to emphasize the fact that it is god and not man who is always the principal party to be avenged provision was made for a heifer to be killed as propitiation in the case of an unsolved murder whose perpetrator could not be found deut n2019 nafter all it is not the injury to relatives or any other human consideration that makes homicide the serious sin that it is but as god himself pointed out to noah it is the fact that xe2 x80 x9cman was made to the image of god xe2 x80 x9d that makes an assault on him tantamount to an assault on god nit is therefore to god and not to his creatures that reparation is primarily due nthis point was brought out by pope pius xii in an address to italian catholic jurists on may 12 1954 when he said na penalty is the reaction required by law and justice in response to a fault penalty and fault are action and reaction norder violated by a culpable act demands the reintegration and reestablishment of the disturbed equilibrium  n n n na word must be said on the full meaning of penalty nmost of the modern theories of penal law explain penalty and justify it in the final analysis as a means of protection that is defense of the community against criminal undertakings and at the same time an attempt to bring the offender to observance of the law nin those theories the penalty can include sanctions such as the diminution of some goods guaranteed by law so as to teach the guilty to live honestly but those theories fail to consider the expiation of the crime committed which penalizes the violation of the law as the prime function of penalty  n n n nin the metaphysical order penalty is a consequence of dependence on the supreme will dependence which exists in the deepest recesses of created being nif it is ever necessary to hold back the revolt of the free being and reestablish the violated law it is when that is required by the supreme judge and supreme justice ntoday the death penalty is imposed ever more rarely even in cases of proven premeditated murder ndespite the fact that it was instituted by god himself growing numbers of catholics actually consider it immoral njohn paul ii stopping just short of declaring it wrong in principle has declared that it should be imposed very seldom if ever nbut doesn xe2 x80 x99t admitting the penalty in principle demand that it be put into practice nin the us following the lead of the late cardinal bernardin of chicago and like minded prelates won to the new mancentered conciliar religion the faithful are beginning to equate abortion nuclear war and capital punishment as common xe2 x80 x9cthreats to the sacredness of human life xe2 x80 x9d without any reference whatever to the innocence or guilt involved nif they are aware that the church has upheld from apostolic times the right to use force in selfdefense to kill in a just war and to inflict the death penalty on those duly judged guilty of serious crime they now apparently subscribe to the notion propagated by dei verbum at the second vatican council that the unchanging catholic xe2 x80 x9ctradition which comes from the apostles xe2 x80 x9d actually xe2 x80 x9cdevelops in the church xe2 x80 x9d and keeps pace with changing times ii8 n nthe circumstances pertaining to our day would therefore dictate a reassessment of the death penalty which the new mancentered theology insists on viewing almost exclusively from the standpoint of the criminal and human society rather than from god xe2 x80 x99s nat the same time there is more and more discussion about society xe2 x80 x99s responsibility for having produced criminals in the first place together with our moral obligation to rehabilitate them rather than to wreak what is now considered a form of fruitless guilty xe2 x80 x9cvengeance xe2 x80 x9d on them nthe idea that man is by nature good and perfectible is allowed to override all documented evidence that hardened criminals are in fact almost impossible to rehabilitate and that those handed life sentences rarely repent of their wrongdoing n naccording to one widely held opinion the death penalty has proved to be no effective deterrent to crime in any case and should be discarded as impractical nwhat proof of this can possibly be offered nhow can we know ndeterrence from evil is not the primary purpose of meting out punishment in any case yet scripture attests to deterrence as an important side effect of any penalty nto a man proven to have given false witness against another deuteronomy laid down xe2 x80 x9cthey shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother n n nthat others hearing may fear and may not dare to do such things nthou shalt not pity him but shalt require life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot xe2 x80 x9d deut n191921 nand the preacher notes that when xe2 x80 x9csentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil the children of men commit evils without any fear xe2 x80 x9d eccles n811 n nto illustrate how shallow catholic thinking on the death penalty has become and how far it has deviated from the ageold doctrine of the church a priest of a presumably traditional catholic fraternity writes in answer to a query addressed to him on the subject by saying nthe death penalty is based on the common teachings of theologians but is not itself a declared dogma ntherefore it is not permissible to call those who hold it is immoral heretics nto approach this as a dogmatic teaching is imprudent nthose who argue for its abolition do not necessarily put society in danger considering possibilities of penal systems nthose however who maintain its continued use often see it more as a tool for revenge nplease consider that in anger and tragedy the desire for revenge usually overrides reason and an honest answering of the question xe2 x80 x9cmust this person xe2 x80 x99s life be taken to preserve society xe2 x80 x9d the desire for swift and firm convictions has sent many to death who never deserved such a punishment nor was such a punishment truly necessary for the safety of society ni do not believe the death penalty is necessary in 90 percent of the cases where it is applied nthus to call for a moratorium  n n nis not unjust or incorrect nthat the death penalty can become an instrument of revenge and that unjust sentences are sometimes handed down can be dismissed as irrelevant to the argument ngiven the fallen human condition such injustices are bound to occur in any judicial system and everyone agrees that they should be ruthlessly remedied nwhat is not irrelevant is that the author of the letter falls headlong into the very error pius xii warns against nconsidering the physical safety of society as the only real reason for executing a criminal he feels the death penalty can now be safely discarded allegedly on the grounds that we now have at our disposal many better ways of protecting people from him nthat the penalty is due primarily as expiation to god in justice and only secondarily to man has been lost sight of altogether nthe supernatural dimension of the punishment as an agent for the spiritual good of both society and the criminal is furthermore not only not addressed but treated as nonexistent nthis first appeared in the remnant nearly 20 years ago nisn t it time to subscribe to the paper of record  for the traditional catholic counterrevolution n nthe source of this kind of materialistic thinking in the church is not hard to trace naccording to statistics published in the national review for september 16 1983 out of 9140 murders committed in the us in 1960 just before the council 56 persons were executed nin 1965 the year the council closed although the tally of murders had risen to 9850 only 7 were executed nin the decade from 1967 to 1977 a moratorium was declared during which not one single execution took place nat its close the number of murders had more than doubled and in any six month period more americans were being murdered than those executed during the whole course of the century nat this point although the murder rate has continued to rise dramatically executions continue to be rare nmany nations notably england france sweden south africa and our neighbors canada and mexico have abolished the death penalty altogether nwhether or not the u s will follow suit and outlaw it nationally still remains to be seen n nwhat leaps to the eye from the mounting statistics is that decline in the exercise of the death penalty has kept close pace with decline in the faith and church attendance nit is sober fact that death sentences were liberally handed out in the heyday of christendom when the faith was strong and governments legislated with an eye to the spiritual welfare of citizens whose sights were primarily on future bliss in heaven nin modern times which find the church strictly separated from the state on principle and denied any active part in civil government secularism has become the state religion directing legislation exclusively to temporal objectives nit is only to be expected that materialists xe2 x80 x94for whom the immortal soul does not exist and who believe that this present life of the senses on earth is the only one man has xe2 x80 x94should be reluctant to punish anyone by killing him nin their eyes this means total extinction a penalty certainly in excess of any transgression of which he may be guilty n nnot even god completely obliterates a human existence not even for the most odious sins for he made the human soul immortal and hell eternal nit might be argued however that if the criminal is thought to have to have totally terminated his victim why not do the same to him nin the days of christendom condemned criminals were given every opportunity to make their peace with god in many cases the date of execution being delayed in order to accomplish this purpose njustice was served but not at the expense of charity and there was no question of taking vengeance on the culprit nnor was the idea of xe2 x80 x9crehabilitation xe2 x80 x9d with possible reentry into society ever entertained where crimes deserving death were concerned nit has been noted by prison chaplains in our century that swift execution in most cases leads to admission of guilt and sincere repentance whereas those who receive life sentences or suffer long delays are likely to maintain their innocence in hopes of a parole and eventually die in their sins n nas it is the death penalty as administered by society must be viewed against the backdrop of divine revelation if it is to make any real sense nwhen catholic society puts a man to death it terminates only his temporal life on earth catapulting him into eternity for his final judgment before almighty god nsuffering the penalty not only allows the criminal to render expiation to god and to society but if accepted in christ xe2 x80 x99s grace with due repentance it preserves his soul from hell and eliminates much of his purgatory nif his contrition is perfect it xe2 x80 x99s conceivable that he could go straight to heaven nin any case neither he nor society is any longer burdened with the guilt of his wrongdoing n nas michel martin pointed out in an article in rome et d xe2 x80 x99ailleurs for septemberoctober 1983 xe2 x80 x9cthe truth is that the problem of the death penalty is insoluble except from a christian point of view xe2 x80 x9d that it figured so prominently in christian societies is due to the fact that in the order of charity atonement to god was sought above any atonement due to man and the spiritual welfare of citizens above their physical wellbeing nmodern secularized society assumes that physical extinction is the worst thing that can happen to a human being whereas the faith teaches that eternal damnation is incalculably worse nin the context of the faith the importance of a man xe2 x80 x99s present short life on earth cannot be compared with his future endless existence in heaven n nas we have seen the death penalty has a very long history ndating from its institution by god in eden to its delegation after the flood to men who would wield it in god xe2 x80 x99s name it has threaded its way without interruption through the fabric of human civilizations until these latter days none might expect that after the incarnation when god became man and replaced the old testament xe2 x80 x99s law of talion based on strict justice with a new dispensation based on love and grace the death penalty could be safely abolished as outmoded nconverts to the prevailing conciliar religion and its xe2 x80 x9cnew pentecost xe2 x80 x9d would in fact argue in this wise perhaps citing the council xe2 x80 x99s famous declaration in gaudium et spes that xe2 x80 x9cthanks to the experience of past ages the nature of man himself is more clearly revealed and new roads to truth are opened xe2 x80 x9d and the world now has xe2 x80 x9ca keener awareness of human dignity xe2 x80 x9d  44 73 n nfar from obliterating the death penalty however the incarnation only laid bare its deepest significance hidden from the beginning nas the new dispensation xe2 x80 x99s foremost theologian st paul would declare the old penalty remained very much in force xe2 x80 x9calmost all things according to the law are cleansed with blood and without the shedding of blood there is no remission xe2 x80 x9d it is still xe2 x80 x9cappointed for men once to die and after this the judgment xe2 x80 x9d heb n9 2227 but now with the possibility of eternal bliss in heaven nthis possibility is owed furthermore to a death by one of the cruelest means ever devised unjustly inflicted on one supremely innocent man who was god in a miscarriage of human justice beyond any the world could ever have imagined nwhen god set the death penalty in eden he pronounced it on himself to be carried out in the fullness of time through the malicious free wills of his own creatures nthe cross which was its instrument is the very sign of christianity the only means of salvation n nnot even from the cross did christ decry the death penalty either for himself or for the two thieves crucified with him nit would continue to be dealt out to men by other men on earth with only one significant change henceforth it would be administered under the authority of the glorified man who is christ the king as part and parcel of that universal power xe2 x80 x9cin heaven and on earth xe2 x80 x9d which he received from his father matt n2818 after his resurrection nfrom that point on it is christ who delegates the divine authority to punish by killing and both scripture and tradition testify that it is lawfully wielded by those to whom he entrusts the temporal sword in his kingdom nas he told pontius pilate at the time of his trial xe2 x80 x9cthou shouldst not have any power against me unless it were given thee from above xe2 x80 x9d john 1910 n npope leo xiii reaffirmed this truth in sapientiae christianae in 1890 when he declared that xe2 x80 x9ctrue and legitimate authority is devoid of sanction unless it proceed from god the supreme ruler and lord of all nthe almighty alone can commit power to a man over his fellow men xe2 x80 x9d even though they may be unaware of the true source of their power it is always the duty of legitimate authorities to ensure public order by punishing evildoers by death if appropriate nas st paul said ntherefore he that resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist purchase to themselves eternal damnation nfor rulers are not a terror to the good work but to the evil n n nfor he is the minister of god to thee for good nbut if thou do that which is evil fear for he beareth not the sword in vain nfor he is the minister of god and avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil rom n1324 nsufficient of itself to expiate every sin which the children of adam could ever commit the execution of the mangod nevertheless did not abolish the penalty of death nit continues to be the wages of sin rom 623 and men must still submit to it sooner or later by forfeiting their lives either willingly or unwillingly na share in making restitution for sin was thus accorded to all of us for although our lord xe2 x80 x99s ignominious death removed from us the guilt of the original transgression through baptism it did not remove its effects nthese were allowed to remain as restraints on men who now raised to a new supernatural existence were capable of committing incalculably more grievous sins than heretofore nas for the death penalty it remains the inescapable consequence of our fallen nature and is of the highest utility in deterring us from following our hereditary inclination to evil n nwhat christ did was to sanctify the death penalty transforming it into a sacrament of life for those who believe nas st paul declared xe2 x80 x9cdeath is swallowed up in victory no death where is thy victory no death where is thy sting n n nfor by a man came death and by a man the resurrection of the dead nand as in adam all die so also in christ all shall be made alive xe2 x80 x9d 1 cor n15 5455 2122 nthe first of that

calvary to xe2 x80 x9csuffer under pontius pilate xe2 x80 x9d with him he granted a meritorious share in accomplishing xe2 x80 x9cthe mystery which hath been hidden for ages and generations but is now made manifest to his saints xe2 x80 x9d to all who like st paul would xe2 x80 x9cnow rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up those things which are wanting of the sufferings of christ in my flesh

moment of death ushers them either into heaven hell or purgatory nthe most that can be said is that their lives here on earth are shortened and they must settle their accounts sooner than expected nthis could be a great mercy for them as well as for society both in terms of expiation and protection from any future crimes they might have perpetrated nthe death penalty from the first one imposed

nbut this is the milieu of machination around someone who has the right of natural justice concerning his freedom nputting aside freedom of speech the persecution of this man has been something that should horrify all freethinking people nif it doesn xe2 x80 x99t horrify us then we have surrendered something very valuable ndb among those who should be especially horrified are those of us in the journalistic community njohn i would like you to explain once again why julian assange is such a significant journalist why so many journalistic institutions have collaborated with him based on the information he provided nwe are talking about a publisher and reporter who has changed history njp nothing in my time as a journalist has equaled the rise of wikileaks and its extraordinary impact on journalism nit is probably the only journalistic organization that has a 100 record of accuracy and authenticity nall of wikileaks xe2 x80 x99 revelations have been authentic nand it has been done xe2 x80 x9cwithout fear or favor xe2 x80 x9d although there has been a concentration on say the release of the hillary clintonpodesta emails or the iraq and afghan war logs wikileaks has released information that people have a right to know across the spectrum nit has released something like 800000 documents from russia and now wikileaks is accused of being an agent of russia nwikileaks xe2 x80 x99 journalism has covered a universal space and that is the first time this has happened nin tunisia the release of wikileaks documents foretold the arab spring nthe people at the forefront of the uprising in tunisia credit wikileaks for informing them of what their repressive government was doing behind their backs nin venezuela wikileaks released cables which described in great detail how the united states intended to subvert the government of hugo chavez nsome of this was published in the mainstream media when there was still a collaboration with wikileaks nthe clintonpodesta emails which appear to have made a number of people resentful were published in the new york times nthese emails showed the close role that hillary clinton and the clinton foundation played in support of extreme jihadism in the middle east nthat was a very important piece of information for people to know and understand nby doing that wikileaks performed an extraordinary public service while at the same time making some very serious enemies nrandy credico people sometimes forget that apart from being a journalist julian assange is a human being nyou have known him a long time ncould you give us a feel for the kind of person julian assange is njp julian is a very principled individual nhe feels very strongly about the moral basis of wikileaks nwhen he first put up wikileaks he wrote that the whole idea of transparency honoring people xe2 x80 x99s right to know was the central aim of the website nhe feels that very strongly nany attempt to do a deal with julian to shut down wikileaks will no doubt be resisted nas a person julian is an extremely interesting man nhe is very well read nhe studied physics nhe has a very good sense of humor and i have often laughed out loud with him about situations that others might consider too bleak to discuss nhis black humor is a part of his survival kit nobviously he is incredibly resilient npersonally i could never endure what he has especially in recent years nbut this comes with a cost and his health is continuing to deteriorate nthose close to him are extremely worried ncypherpunks freedom a julian assange best price 304 buy new 955 as of 0645 edt  details nin a letter to the australian prime minister malcolm turnbull julian xe2 x80 x99s father john shipton wrote xe2 x80 x9ci ask the prime minister to do all within his power to return julian home before julian xe2 x80 x99s situation becomes an irreversible tragedy xe2 x80 x9d that is why this is such an urgent case of justice toward a single human being as well as a case of a journalistic organization xe2 x80 x99s right to function and our right to have the information it provides nonly seven years ago the current prime minister said that when an australian citizen is threatened in this way the prime minister should respond nthat was turnbull before he became prime minister nnow the government is playing its usual role of being the fiftyfirst state of the united states nit is a true disgrace nrc what about theresa may and the british government nare they getting pressure from the united states or are there internal reasons why they want to keep julian assange quiet njp everything comes down to the relationship with the united states naustralia has an almost totally servile relationship with america in which its national security structure much of its academic life and certainly much of its media is integrated into the us system nthat is not entirely the case in britain nsince the loss of its empire after the second world war britain has been eager to play a secondary role to the new imperial power nin many parts of the world britain is still the biggest corporate investor nbut it does move in lockstep with the us on much of its foreign policy nit is interesting to see the corruption that this kind of relationship produces ninformation has come out that the crown prosecution service tried to prevent the swedes from giving up the case against julian on bogus sexual assault charges nthe pressure was on from london to keep it going njulian is also seen as defying a system and that is just not acceptable nthere is a real element of vindictiveness here nthe crown prosecution service kept this case going when otherwise the european warrant put out by the swedes would have been abandoned in 2013 nwhen julian came up to a bail hearing last year it was an absolute disgrace nthe judge described julian xe2 x80 x99s circumstances as if he were on some sort of extended vacation nwhat didn xe2 x80 x99t emerge was the whole conflict of interest in this hearing nthe judge xe2 x80 x99s husband is a figure deep within the national security establishment in britain who was named in wikileaks documents nbecause there is no serious media examining the whole wikileaks witch hunt virtually none of this emerges ndb the corporate press has a major responsibility if julian assange goes down don xe2 x80 x99t you agree njp as you know dennis governments do respond to pressure from powerful media interests nit rarely happens but when it does governments do change their tune nthere has been no pressure from media in the united states britain australia or pretty much anywhere except in programs like yours outside the mainstream nyou are absolutely right in that the responsibility of journalists for what has happened to julian assange and what might happen to wikileaks is undeniable ni was looking this morning at a report by media lens in britain describing how the british press has reported on julian assange nit describes the tsunami of vindictive personal abuse that has been heaped upon julian from wellknown journalists many claiming liberal credentials nthe guardian which used to consider itself the most enlightened newspaper in the country has probably been the worst nthe frontal attacks have been coming not from governments but from journalists ni described this recently as xe2 x80 x9cvichy journalism xe2 x80 x9d a term which now fits so much of the mainstream media nit collaborates in the same way that the vichy government in france collaborated with the nazis nthe wikileaks files t wikileaks best price 275 buy new 700 as of 1200 edt  details there used to be spaces within the socalled mainstream for unbiased discussion for the airing of real grievances and injustices nthese spaces have closed completely nthe attacks on julian assange illustrate what has happened to the socalled free media in the west ni have been a journalist for a very long time and i have always worked within the mainstream but the journalism i see now is part of a rapacious establishment and one of its prime targets is julian assange and wikileaks nthis is precisely because wikileaks is producing the kind of journalism that they ought to be doing nwikileaks has in fact shamed journalists which might help to explain the deeply personal abuse he has suffered nwikileaks has revealed what journalists should have revealed a long time ago ndb even the attorney for the new york times happened to mention that if julian assange gets prosecuted the times could get prosecuted under the same laws njp it could but i don xe2 x80 x99t believe it would be because power respects power nthe new york times is part of the establishment nthe difference with wikileaks is that it is outside of the establishment and is truly independent ndb what would be your strongest plea for julian assange njp it xe2 x80 x99s very simple nthis is about justice nin a famous speech given in the 1930 xe2 x80 x99s by parson martin niemoller he said that first the nazis came for socialists but he didn xe2 x80 x99t speak up because that didn xe2 x80 x99t concern him nthen they came for trade unionists but he didn xe2 x80 x99t speak up because that didn xe2 x80 x99t concern him nhe didn xe2 x80 x99t speak up when they came for the jews because he wasn xe2 x80 x99t a jew nand of course finally they came for him nthat might not be a precise parallel but if julian assange is allowed to literally go under it represents the conquest of all of us nit means that we have kept quiet nkeeping quiet has allowed the great atrocities of histories to take place nif julian is allowed to be spirited away to some supermax hellhole it will be a great atrocity ndb in the library silence is golden nin the world of human rights silence equals mass murder nthey say you shouldn xe2 x80 x99t yell fire in a crowded theater just to get a reaction nbut if you know the theater is in fact on fire and you do not shout

285,archbishop hebda and mccarrick  scandal n narchbishop bernard hebda of st paul mn responds to the mccarrick scandal the catholic spirit nevery time mass is celebrated the priest prays that jesus will xe2 x80 x9clook not on our sins but on the faith of his church xe2 x80 xa6  xe2 x80 x9d that xe2 x80 x99s been an important prayer for me in the time that i have been serving this archdiocese well aware of our sins but equally aware of the strong and vibrant faith of this local church ni xe2 x80 x99ve been praying that prayer even more earnestly in these past weeks as the church in the united states has once again come facetoface with its sins with reports that former cardinal theodore mccarrick one of the most prominent churchmen in the united states in the last quarter century has been accused of abusing two minors and sexually harassing or assaulting a number of seminarians and young priests nto make matters worse if that is even possible evidence has surfaced that indicates that a bishop as well as some priests and laity had brought the allegations about misconduct with seminarians to the attention of church authorities but to no avail archbishop mccarrick was nonetheless xe2 x80 x9cpromoted xe2 x80 x9d to become the archbishop in our nation xe2 x80 x99s capital and elevated to the college of cardinals nwhile i realize that it is not always easy to evaluate the credibility of those bringing allegations and that there xe2 x80 x99s often a tendency to believe those we know over those we don xe2 x80 x99t i don xe2 x80 x99t think that the church in the united states will rest xe2 x80 x94 and confidence will be restored xe2 x80 x94 until the matter is independently investigated and explained and assurances are given that there are safeguards in place to make sure that something like this couldn xe2 x80 x99t happen again nthe matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that i had served in the archdiocese of newark as coadjutor archbishop from november 4 2013 to march 25 2016 when i was named archbishop here nit was while i was in newark that i was introduced to thencardinal mccarrick na number of good catholics have written to ask for a personal accounting on my part inquiring whether i was made aware in my time in newark of the 2005 and 2007 settlements involving archbishop mccarrick or if i knew of any allegations against him ni can state unequivocally that i learned of those settlements only in june of this year as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the archdiocese of new york nwhat i know of the settlements i know from the newspapers nwhen serving in newark i was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts but not on past legal matters unless they were still being discussed in the press nby the time i arrived in newark in november 2013 the 2005 and 2007 settlements were apparently considered ancient history nit would be untrue to state that i had never heard any allegations about cardinal mccarrick nyears before i ever lived in newark and never imagining that i would be assigned there i had indeed read xe2 x80 x94 as a somewhat geeky exlawyer xe2 x80 x94 an allegation about cardinal mccarrick in the context of a 2005 lawsuit in the southern district of new york against archbishop myers cardinal eagan bishop hubbard and the irish christian brothers nwhile the complaint didn xe2 x80 x99t supply any details the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that xe2 x80 x9carchbishop mccarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them xe2 x80 x9d the complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation nknowing however that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts i never gave the particular allegation about cardinal mccarrick any credence ni can also state without exception that no one in my years in newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by archbishop mccarrick and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him ni heard lots of gutwrenching stories in my twoandahalf years there but none of them involved archbishop mccarrick nwith st john paul ii xe2 x80 x99s 1995 visit he was remembered for xe2 x80 x9cbringing a saint to newark xe2 x80 x9d not as an abuser of seminarians minors or priests nwhen i was installed here in st paul he joined me at lunch along with my father sister godmother and then 12yearold nephew ni can assure you that i would never have allowed that to happen if i had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month nwhile the letters and emails of recent days are sober reminders that there xe2 x80 x99s still a long way to go in restoring trust i nonetheless welcome the efforts to hold me accountable to you the faithful of this archdiocese nthe events of these past weeks have shown that no one can be above the law regardless of rank or privilege ni was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend and i look forward to continuing my work with the office of ministerial standards and safe environment and our archdiocesan review board in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct nour heavenly patron st paul reminds us that xe2 x80 x9cwhere sin abounds grace abounds all the more xe2 x80 x9d may these difficult days be days of great grace for this local church nremnant comment while we certainly appreciate his excellency  candid explanation of what he knew and did not know about this horrific scandal in the church we would also humbly beg him to take it one step further by publicly proclaiming his profession of belief in the church  official teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts and the socalled gay lifestyle which includes her longheld teaching that homosexual activity between clerics is an ecclesiastical crime nfar from being reassured of this by their bishops many catholic faithful today are informed that the modern catholic church is now an inclusive community that welcomes all and judges none nall very well and good except for the fact that the church  constant and unchanging moral teaching on this makes no such allowance nin fact this binding and constant teaching of the church was reaffirmed most recently in her most authoritative modern catechism which holds the exact opposite position from that apparently held by many bishops nhomosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex basing itself on sacred scripture which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity tradition has always declared that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered nthey are contrary to the natural law nthey close the sexual act to the gift of life nthey do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity nunder no circumstances can they be approved ncatechism of the catholic church 2357 nunder no circumstances xe2 x80 xa6except for those dreamed up by a number of bishops in this country who apparently think that it should be left up to individual parishes to decide if they are lgbtqfriendly or not neven pope john paul the great  vatican clarified the church  teaching on october 31 1986 in the xe2 x80 x9cletter to the bishops of the catholic church on the pastoral care of homosexual persons xe2 x80 x9d nalthough the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder ntherefore special concern and pastoral attention should be directed to those who have this condition lest they be led to believe that the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally acceptable option nit is not nnotice the late pope does not say xe2 x80 x9clet the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home among your faithful xe2 x80 x9d as father james martin and his episcopal fans are at least implying on a regular basis in the media ndoes archbishop hebda believe it is time for the church to stop humiliating herself by stooping to accommodate a special interest group that obviously doesn t care about her or the moral code by which she governs ndoes he believe that all catholics must follow the rules of the church pertaining to the sixth commandmentor just the straight catholics ndoes his excellency believe that if some homosexual catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our catholic christian community anyway even if they are in samesex unions npope john paul certainly didn t accept that nin his 2005 book memory and identity john paul referred to homosexuality as an xe2 x80 x9cideology of evil xe2 x80 x9d insisting of socalled gay marriage  that n xe2 x80 x9cit is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil perhaps more insidious and hidden which attempts to pit human rights against the family and man xe2 x80 x9d nwas pope john paul the great an intolerant homophobe nare father martin and his pals in the episcopacy really so enlightened over every pope saint and moral theologian in history nor is it not so that it is both negligent and uncharitable for some bishops to refuse to inform their faithful that according to the church  own infallible teaching everlasting damnation is the price to be paid for this kind of inclusivity and toleration nand if the episcopal retort is going to be that this acceptance refers only to chaste homosexuals then we call foul even louder since this crosses the line into willful deception nwe re all sinners of course and the church already accepts repentant homosexuals as they are just as she accepts repentant practitioners of any sins of the flesh nso why are our bishops playing dumb nquite obviously it is because what they are actually closing an episcopal eye to are the folks who want to keep right on sinningand sinning proudly nthis is what the church of accompaniment is all about nbut practically speakingin the real worldthis kind of accompaniment is only greenlighting vice and mortal sin and as such constitutes a hideous violation of everything these bishops supposedly believe as catholic priests nso what  going on here nwho are these bishops that think they can play fast and loose not only with the moral theology of the catholic church but also with the immortal souls of their flock nis it any wonder that priests and laity alike are changing their attitude on the gay lifestyle and violations of the sixth commandment when so many bishops are working to remove the stigma attached to this sin that scripture tells us cries to heaven for vengeance nthe catholic church  newfound climate of tolerance is exactly what mccarrick and company are counting on nit is truly homophobic for any bishop to lie to the gay community about this and to risk the immortal souls of the sheep merely so that the shepherd might pride himself on occupying the politically correct high ground nthis is gross dereliction of duty and we hope and pray that all the good us bishops would jump at the opportunity to issue statements reaffirming the church  clear teaching against all sins of the flesh homo and heterosexual nagain god bless archbishop hebda for this welcome statement and may god grant him the courage now to finish the task by publicly reassuring the scandalized faithful that it xe2 x80 x99s not just abuse of minors or sexual harassment that xe2 x80 x99s going on here nour bishops must make it absolutely clear that the church  moral theology on homosexuality will not and can not be trumped by the dictates of political correctness nand neither can god  law be changed to accommodate the spirit of our xe2 x80 x9cmost enlightened xe2 x80 x9d agewhich is of course an evil spirit that can be driven out only by prayer and fasting nuntil the church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis and the massive problem of homosexuality in the clergy nmccarrick will become the norm not the exception and confidence in the leadership and moral authority of the catholic church will remain in the toilet indefinitely exactly as the forces of darkness intended all along n,"['appeal_to_fear-prejudice', 'loaded_language', 'doubt', 'flag-waving', 'slogans', 'thought-terminating_cliches',

fidelity to the church xe2 x80 x99s moral theology specifically her teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts nin so doing the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the church yes nthey will be crucified in the media yes nbut they will also be doing their sacred duty before god in reassuring their thoroughly scandalized flocks that they are absolutely committed to the defense and enforcement of the church xe2 x80 x99s moral teaching at a time when it is under scurrilous attack from within nnothing less will do nbishop morlino has now done it and we respectfully demand that

the diocese of madison nthe past weeks have brought a great deal of scandal justified anger and a call for answers and action by many faithful catholics here in the us and overseas directed at the church hierarchy regarding sexual sins by bishops priests and even cardinals nstill more anger is rightly directed at those who have been complicit in keeping some of these serious sins from coming to light nfor my part xe2 x80 x94 and i know i am not alone xe2 x80 x94 i am tired of this ni am tired of people being hurt gravely hurt ni am tired of the obfuscation of truth ni am tired of sin nand as one who has tried xe2 x80 x94 despite my many imperfections xe2 x80 x94 to lay down my life for christ and his church i am tired of the regular violation of sacred duties by those entrusted with immense responsibility from the lord for the care of his people nthe stories being brought into light and displayed in gruesome detail with regard to some priests religious and now even those in places of highest leadership are sickening nhearing even one of these stories is quite literally enough to make someone sick nbut my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when i recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years nfor them these are not stories they are indeed realities nto them i turn and say again i am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart nif you have not already done so i beg you to reach out as hard as that may be and seek help to begin to heal nalso if you xe2 x80 x99ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese i encourage you to come forward to make a report to law enforcement and to our victim xe2 x80 x99s assistance coordinator so that we might begin with you as an individual to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible nthere is nothing about these stories that is okay nthese actions committed by more than a few can only be classified as evil evil that cries out for justice and sin that must be cast out from our church nfaced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the church i have been tempted to despair nand why nthe reality of sin xe2 x80 x94 even sin in the church xe2 x80 x94 is nothing new nwe are a church made of sinners but we are sinners called to sanctity nso what is new nwhat is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the church and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others nunless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity we as an institution and as individuals will continue to suffer the xe2 x80 x9cwages of sin xe2 x80 x9d nfor too long we have diminished the reality of sin xe2 x80 x94 we have refused to call a sin a sin xe2 x80 x94 and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy nin our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the way the truth and the life nin order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation nwhy do we do this nis it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being xe2 x80 x9cpastoral xe2 x80 x9d have we covered over the truth out of fear nare we afraid of being disliked by people in this world nor are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives nperhaps these are the reasons but perhaps it is more or less complex than this nin the end the excuses do not matter nwe must be done with sin nit must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable nlove sinners nyes naccept true repentance nyes nbut do not say sin is okay nand do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave lasting consequences nfor the church the crisis we face is not limited to the mccarrick affair or the pennsylvania grand jury report or anything else that may come nthe deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the church nthere is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching our preaching our decision making and our very way of living nif you xe2 x80 x99ll permit me what the church needs now is more hatred nas i have said previously st thomas aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity nas the book of proverbs says xe2 x80

for sin xe2 x80 x94 either within our own lives or within the lives of our communities nto be a refuge for sinners which we should be the church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled

x99re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests bishops and cardinals nwe are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some in short sacrilege but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all nto call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further nthere has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of nowculturallyacceptable acts of homosexuality from the publicallydeplorable acts of pedophilia nthat is to say until recently the problems of the church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia xe2 x80 x94 this despite clear evidence to the contrary nit is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more nto fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the church has never held any of it to be acceptable xe2 x80 x94 neither the abuse of children nor any use of one xe2 x80 x99s sexuality outside of the marital relationship nor the sin of sodomy nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority nin this last regard special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case that being the allegations of formercardinal theodore mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s oftrumored now very public sexual sins predation and abuse of power nthe welldocumented details of this case are disgraceful and seriously scandalous as is any covering up of such appalling actions by other church leaders who knew about it based on solid evidence nwhile recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by archbishop mccarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light longignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification nit is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the catholic church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the lord nthe church xe2 x80 x99s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest nand the decision to act upon this disordered inclination is a sin so grave that it cries out to heaven for vengeance especially when it involves preying upon the young or the vulnerable nsuch wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred nchristian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness nbut while hating the sin we must never hate the sinner who is called to conversion penance and renewed communion with christ and his church through his inexhaustible mercy nat the same time however the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense nin fact a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy because while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life if he willingly accepts his punishment thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come nmotivated therefore by love and concern for souls i stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty nthe sins and crimes of mccarrick and of far too many others in the church bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests bishops and cardinals and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians nthe result of the first instance of mistrust harms the church and the very good work we do in christ xe2 x80 x99s name nit causes others to sin in their thoughts words and deeds xe2 x80 x94 which is the very definition of scandal nand the second mistrust harms the future of the church since our future priests are at stake ni said that i was tempted to despair in light of all of this nhowever that temptation quickly passed thanks be to god nno matter how large the problem we know that we are called to go forward in faith to rely upon god xe2 x80 x99s promises to us and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can within our spheres of influence ni have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters and i have begun to and will continue to talk with the priests of the diocese as well as the faithful in person and through my weekly column and homilies making things as clear as i can from my perspective nhere now i offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese nin the first place we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese nthis is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance nor our efforts to improve nwe must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry as well as acrosstheboard background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals nhere again i state as we have done consistently if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the church contact law enforcement nif you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our victim xe2 x80 x99s assistance coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources nif you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first but even if you don xe2 x80 x99t want to please still reach out to us nto our seminarians if you are unchastely propositioned abused or threatened no matter by whom or if you directly witness unchaste behavior report it to me and to the seminary rector ni will address it swiftly and vigorously ni will not stand for this in my diocese or anywhere i send men for formation ni trust that the seminaries i choose very discriminately to help form our men will not ignore this type of scandalous behavior and i will continue to verify that expectation nto our priests most simply live out the promises you made on your ordination day nyou are called to serve christ xe2 x80 x99s people beginning with praying daily the liturgy of the hours nthis is to keep you very close to god nin addition you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop nin obedience strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest a hard working priest and a pure and happy priest xe2 x80 x94 as christ himself is calling you to do nand by extension live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to christ the church and the people whom he has called you to serve ngod will give you the graces to do so nask him for the help you need daily and throughout every day nand if you are unchastely propositioned abused or threatened no matter by whom or if you directly witness unchaste behavior report it to me ni will not stand for this in my diocese any more than in our seminaries nto the faithful of the diocese if you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest bishop cardinal or any employee of the church bring it forward nit will be addressed quickly and justly nif you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse bring it forward as well nsuch actions are sinful and scandalous and we cannot allow anyone to use their position or power to abuse another person nagain in addition to injuring individuals these actions injure the very body of christ his church nfurthermore i add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate priesthood our parishes schools universities and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any wouldbe sexual predator or accomplice ni will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed ni will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood nfailure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship ni will continue to require with our men and our funds that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests in the image of christ ni ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities the faithful in the pews and to god almighty not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the church but our seminarians university students and all the faithful as well ni promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest or any church employee guilty of abuse ni ask everyone reading this to pray npray earnestly for the church and all her ministers npray for our seminarians nand pray for yourselves and your families nwe must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and in turn hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well and nfinally i ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the diocese of madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the most sacred heart of jesus and to the immaculate heart of mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy ni will be offering a public mass of reparation on friday september 14 the feast of the triumph of the holy cross at holy name heights and i ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes nin addition i ask that all priests clergy religious and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming autumn ember days sep 19 21 and 22 as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and i invite all the faithful to do the same nsome sins like some demons can only be driven out by prayer and fasting nthis letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the church to begin to heal from and stave off this deep illness in the church but rather the next steps i believe we can take locally nmore than anything else we as a church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil nwe must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness nwe must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors xe2 x80 x94 myself included xe2 x80 x94 that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness nwe must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth nagain right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country calling for real reform and xe2 x80 x9chouse cleaning xe2 x80 x9d of this type of depravity ni stand with them ni don xe2 x80 x99t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally nbut i do know this and i make this my last point and last promise for the diocese of madison xe2 x80 x9cas for me and my household we will serve the lord xe2 x80 x9d nfaithfully yours in the lord nmost rev nrobert c morlino nbishop of madison nthis text first appeared

youth and seminarians nthe emerging homosexual clergy scandal is just beginning to unfold nthe laity will learn over the course of the next few years that the underlying cause of the criminal scandal lies in the homosexual network of priests bishops and cardinals who preyed on the youth assaulted seminarians promoted their own ilk and punished any whistleblowers or noncompliant priests nhere is the dirty secret that is now emerging nmany in the hierarchy were active homosexuals who intentionally relaxed and ignored the church xe2 x80 x99s teaching and moral stance on homosexuality nthe

sake nand he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once peradventure ten shall be found there nand he said i will not destroy it for ten  sake nand the lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with abraham and abraham returned unto his place ngenesis 181633 ngot questionsorg explains very well xe2 x80 xa6 ngenesis chapter 19 records the two angels disguised as human men visiting sodom and gomorrah nlot met the angels in the city square and urged them to stay at his house nthe angels agreed nthe bible then informs us before they had gone to bed all the men from every part of the city of sodom xe2 x80 x94 both young and old xe2 x80 x94 surrounded the house nthey called to lot where are the men who came to you tonight nbring them out to us so that we can have sex with them ngenesis 1945 the angels then proceed to blind all the men of sodom and gomorrah and urge lot and his family to flee from the cities to escape the wrath that god was about to deliver nlot and his family flee the city and then the lord rained down burning sulfur on sodom and gomorrah xe2 x80 x94 from the lord out of the heavens nthus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain including all those living in the cities genesis 192 4  nin light of the passage the most common response to the question what was the sin of sodom and gomorrah nis that it was homosexuality nthat is how the term xe2 x80 x9dsodomy xe2 x80 x9d came to be used to refer to anal sex between two men whether consensual or forced nclearly homosexuality was part of the reason god destroyed the two cities nthe men of sodom and gomorrah wanted to perform homosexual gang rape on the two angels who were disguised as men nat the same time it is not biblical to say that homosexuality was the exclusive reason why god destroyed sodom and gomorrah nthe cities of sodom and gomorrah were definitely not exclusive in terms of the sins in which they indulged nezekiel 164950 declares now this was the sin of your sister sodom she and her daughters were arrogant overfed and unconcerned they did not help the poor and needy nthey were haughty and did detestable things before me the hebrew word translated detestable refers to something that is morally disgusting and is the exact same word used in leviticus 1822 that refers to homosexuality as an abomination nsimilarly jude 7 declares sodom and gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion nso again while homosexuality was not the only sin in which the cities of sodom and gomorrah indulged it does appear to be the primary reason for the destruction of the cities nthose who attempt to explain away the biblical condemnations of homosexuality claim that the sin of sodom and gomorrah was inhospitality nthe men of sodom and gomorrah were certainly being inhospitable nthere is probably nothing more inhospitable than homosexual gang rape nbut to say god completely destroyed two cities and all their inhabitants for being inhospitable clearly misses the point nwhile sodom and gomorrah were guilty of many other horrendous sins homosexuality was the reason god poured fiery sulfur on the cities completely destroying them and all of their inhabitants nto this day the area where sodom and gomorrah were located remains a desolate wasteland nsodom and gomorrah serve as a powerful example of how god feels about sin in general and homosexuality specifically nthe point is that there were no righteous to be spared and the lord did what man failed to do when they had the time to do it nquestion how do you show mercy to a people who observe lying vanities jonah 24 and refuse to return to the lord jeremiah 616 on his terms njeremiah 223 god must be true and judgment must commence nmen today like those of sodom and gomorrah are not valiant for the truth nthey are valiant to proceed from evil to evil jeremiah 5 nthey care more about the pleasures of sin for a season than they are grieved for the afflictions of joseph amos 66 hebrews 1125 nmen today care more of compromise where two men both agree on what they both know is wrong and diplomacy seduction in another guise in promoting anarchy through xe2 x80 x9cantinomianism xe2 x80 x9d than they do the law of god against the sins unto judgment that enslave men john 834 ninstead of establishing judgment within the gate and hating the evil and loving the good amos 515 in hopes that the lord may be gracious to their repentance 2 corinthians 710 they reject the counsel of god against them by hating the good and loving the evil and that to their own damnation nthey care more about the approbation and favor of men than they do that of the living god and what his word declares galatians 110not knowing that which his highly favored among men is an abomination unto the lord luke 1615 nthey wear the cross nyet they have no testimony of the power of god unto salvation by the cross because they do not practice what

least cleareyed enough to recognize true evil at work in the world even if we can no longer see the great good hidden behind the veil nthis is the point about the mccarrick scandal that even religious commentators tend to overlook nhow was he allowed to go on molesting young priests and seminarians when virtually the entire church hierarchy knew what he was up to nand how was such a depraved individual ordained in the first place let alone promoted to cardinalarchbishop of washington nthe answer is ultimately demonic nas catholics we ask st michael to xe2 x80 x9ccast into hell satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls xe2 x80 x9d mccarrick and his fellow perverts in the clergy are responsible not only for their sexual abuses but also for chasing good men away from the priesthood nspend enough time in catholic world and you inevitably meet good men who quit the seminary because of some rampant and often violent depravity nwhat could suit the devil more than to watch the church burn her wheat as she gathers the chaff nthe gates of hell will not prevail against the church as our lord promised nbut they won xe2 x80 x99t stop trying

fifth columnists enter nwhy there xe2 x80 x99s only one possible explanation the second vatican council naggiornamento sounds like a lefebvrist slur nthe idea that an ecumenical council of the catholic church would openly seek to xe2 x80 x9cbring itself up to date xe2 x80 x9d is ridiculous nyet that was precisely the aim nas st pope john xxiii explained xe2 x80 x9cits principal task will be concerned with the conditions and modernization of the church after 20 centuries of life xe2 x80 x9d it was not supposed as some have claimed to simply update the liturgy from its last redesign in 1570 nthe goal was to align the church more with modern world a world defined to a considerable extent by its rejection of the catholic world that flourished before the protestant reformation and french revolution nnow i don xe2 x80 x99t believe pope john saw himself as endangering either orthodoxy or sacred immutable tradition ni share pope paul iv xe2 x80 x99s view nwhen he heard that the

x9cparticipatory xe2 x80 x9d administration nthey became involved in socialist politics nthey formed trade unions to demand the right to marry nthey practiced sauvage intercommunion nof course they had their enablers in the hierarchy as well nperhaps the worst was archbishop marty of paris a leader of the xe2 x80 x9cpriestworker movement xe2 x80 x9d who defended marxist and existentialist atheisms on the floor of the council nduring a homily at the cathedral he also praised the soixantehuitards xe2 x80 x9cthe great outburst of the younger generation that suddenly wanted to take its

modern world continued to reject traditional christian mores so too does the church seem increasingly xe2 x80 x9cout of step xe2 x80 x9d and in need of xe2 x80 x9cmodernizing xe2 x80 x9d ninevitably this came to mean the acceptance of homosexuality nbishop wilton d gregory as president of the us conference of catholic bishops infamously spoke of xe2 x80 x9can ongoing struggle to make sure that the catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men xe2 x80 x9d nbut that predominance has very little to do with homosexuality per se nrather the 1960s rejection of celibacy in the seminaries naturally provided more shall we say opportunities for gay men xe2 x80 x93 given that there are of course no women in catholic seminaries nthis began driving away heterosexuals as well as homosexuals who upheld the church xe2 x80 x99s teachings on chastity and celibacy nneedless to say not all gay priests are violent predators like mccarrick nbut the toleration of sexually active priests gave mccarrick cover to xe2 x80 x9cseduce xe2 x80 x9d his victims nmany have also speculated that because mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s victims were overwhelmingly above the age of consent the media didn xe2 x80 x99t consider them newsworthy nif he xe2 x80 x99d fondled a 12year old altar boy that would have been one thing npedophile priests sell papers nbut taking an 18yearold seminarian to bed nrunning that story would simply be outing a closeted gay man an act the liberal press would no doubt consider xe2 x80 x9chomophobic xe2 x80 x9d as ross douthat pointed out nmeanwhile those bishops who didn xe2 x80 x99t approve of his actions knew the culture xe2 x80 x93 both within the church and without her xe2 x80 x93 were against them nthe postvatican church doesn xe2 x80 x99t like to come off as a nag nshe xe2 x80 x99s not going to cause a fuss by purging sexually active gay men from the clergy just because xe2 x80 xa6 what nit xe2 x80 x99s immoral nthat xe2 x80 x99s not very aggiornamentistic nthe world and our worldly bishops were unsurprisingly of one mind nand even if they were disgusted by mccarrick these prelates weren xe2 x80 x99t willing to jeopardize their careers by standing for

295,former apostolic nuncio to the united states accuses pope of mccarrick coverup calls on francis to resign n nin this tragic moment for the church in various parts of the world xe2 x80 x94 the united states chile honduras australia etc n xe2 x80 x94 bishops have a very grave responsibility ni am thinking in particular of the united states of america where i was sent as apostolic nuncio by pope benedict xvi on october 19 2011 the memorial feast of the first north american martyrs nthe bishops of the united states are called and i with them to follow the example of these first martyrs who brought the gospel to the lands of america to be credible witnesses of the immeasurable love of christ the way the truth and the life nalso as this is an unprecedented moment in papal history perhaps the unprecedented step of recalling benedict xvi to the chair of st peter should also be considered sooner rather than later before this crisis gets any more outofcontrol than it already is nmay god save his church mjm nso serious is the coverup that for the good of the church and protection of the faithful archbishop vigano has called on pope francis to resign nbut before francis resigns we the catholic faithful demand that he also remove from the college of cardinals those who conspired even before the 2013 conclave to make jorge mario bergoglio pope come hell or high water nhe and the st gallen group know exactly who they are narchbishop carlo maria vigan xc3 xb2  11page statement released to the national catholic register accuses pope francis of covering for mccarrick ignoring the sanctions that pope benedict had imposed on mccarrick and also of making mccarrick a trusted counselor who became francis  kingmaker when it came to american appointments and was highly instrumental in the pope  decision to elevate farleft bishops such as blase cupich of chicago and joseph tobin of newark to the college of cardinals nremnant editor  note this could well mark the beginning of the end of the disastrous pontificate of pope francis nthe former apostolic nuncio to the united states has accused francis of repealing sanctions imposed by pope benedict xvi on thencardinal mccarrick for sexual abuse nthis is a charge most serious perhaps without precedent in modern times nbishops and priests abusing their authority have committed horrendous crimes to the detriment of their faithful minors innocent victims and young men eager to offer their lives to the church or by their silence have not prevented that such crimes continue to be perpetrated nto restore the beauty of holiness to the face of the bride of christ which is terribly disfigured by so many abominable crimes and if we truly want to free the church from the fetid swamp into which she has fallen we must have the courage to tear down the culture of secrecy and publicly confess the truths we have kept hidden nwe must tear down the conspiracy of silence with which bishops and priests have protected themselves at the expense of their faithful a conspiracy of silence that in the eyes of the world risks making the church look like a sect a conspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the mafia n xe2 x80 x9cwhatever you have said in the dark  shall be proclaimed from the housetops xe2 x80 x9d lk n123 ni had always believed and hoped that the hierarchy of the church could find within itself the spiritual resources and strength to tell the whole truth to amend and to renew itself nthat is why even though i had repeatedly been asked to do so i always avoided making statements to the media even when it would have been my right to do so in order to defend myself against the calumnies published about me even by highranking prelates of the roman curia nbut now that the corruption has reached the very top of the church xe2 x80 x99s hierarchy my conscience dictates that i reveal those truths regarding the heartbreaking case of the archbishop emeritus of washington dc theodore mccarrick which i came to know in the course of the duties entrusted to me by st john paul ii as delegate for pontifical representations from 1998 to 2009 and by pope benedict xvi as apostolic nuncio to the united states of america from october 19 2011 until end of may 2016 nas delegate for pontifical representations in the secretariat of state my responsibilities were not limited to the apostolic nunciatures but also included the staff of the roman curia hires promotions informational processes on candidates to the episcopate etc nand the examination of delicate cases including those regarding cardinals and bishops that were entrusted to the delegate by the cardinal secretary of state or by the substitute of the secretariat of state nto dispel suspicions insinuated in several recent articles i will immediately say that the apostolic nuncios in the united states gabriel montalvo and pietro sambi both prematurely deceased did not fail to inform the holy see immediately as soon as they learned of archbishop mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s gravely immoral behavior with seminarians and priests nindeed according to what nuncio pietro sambi wrote father boniface ramsey op xe2 x80 x99s letter dated november 22 2000 was written at the request of the late nuncio montalvo nin the letter father ramsey who had been a professor at the diocesan seminary in newark from the end of the xe2 x80 x9980s until 1996 affirms that there was a recurring rumor in the seminary that the archbishop xe2 x80 x9cshared his bed with seminarians xe2 x80 x9d inviting five at a time to spend the weekend with him at his beach house nand he added that he knew a certain number of seminarians some of whom were later ordained priests for the archdiocese of newark who had been invited to this beach house and had shared a bed with the archbishop nthe office that i held at the time was not informed of any measure taken by the holy see after those charges were brought by nuncio montalvo at the end of 2000 when cardinal angelo sodano was secretary of state nlikewise nuncio sambi transmitted to the cardinal secretary of state tarcisio bertone an indictment memorandum against mccarrick by the priest gregory littleton of the diocese of charlotte who was reduced to the lay state for a violation of minors together with two documents from the same littleton in which he recounted his tragic story of sexual abuse by the thenarchbishop of newark and several other priests and seminarians nthe nuncio added that littleton had already forwarded his memorandum to about twenty people including civil and ecclesiastical judicial authorities police and lawyers in june 2006 and that it was therefore very likely that the news would soon be made public nhe therefore called for a prompt intervention by the holy see nin writing up a memo1 on these documents that were entrusted to me as delegate for pontifical representations on december 6 2006 i wrote to my superiors cardinal tarcisio bertone and the substitute leonardo sandri that the facts attributed to mccarrick by littleton were of such gravity and vileness as to provoke bewilderment a sense of disgust deep sorrow and bitterness in the reader and that they constituted the crimes of seducing requesting depraved acts of seminarians and priests repeatedly and simultaneously with several people derision of a young seminarian who tried to resist the archbishop xe2 x80 x99s seductions in the presence of two other priests absolution of the accomplices in these depraved acts sacrilegious celebration of the eucharist with the same priests after committing such acts nin my memo which i delivered on that same december 6 2006 to my direct superior the substitute leonardo sandri i proposed the following considerations and course of action to my superiors n given that it seemed a new scandal of particular gravity as it regarded a cardinal was going to be added to the many scandals for the church in the united states n and that since this matter had to do with a cardinal and according to can n1405 xc2 xa7 1 no n2 xcb x9a xe2 x80 x9cipsius romani pontificis dumtaxat ius est iudicandi xe2 x80 x9d n i proposed that an exemplary measure be taken against the cardinal that could have a medicinal function to prevent future abuses against innocent victims and alleviate the very serious scandal for the faithful who despite everything continued to love and believe in the church ni added that it would be salutary if for once ecclesiastical authority would intervene before the civil authorities and if possible before the scandal had broken out in the press nthis could have restored some dignity to a church so sorely tried and humiliated by so many abominable acts on the part of some pastors nif this were done the civil authority would no longer have to judge a cardinal but a pastor with whom the church had already taken appropriate measures to prevent the cardinal from abusing his authority and continuing to destroy innocent victims nmy memo of december 6 2006 was kept by my superiors and was never returned to me with any actual decision by the superiors on this matter nsubsequently around april 2123 2008 the statement for pope benedict xvi about the pattern of sexual abuse crisis in the united states by richard sipe was published on the internet at richardsipecom non april 24 it was passed on by the prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith cardinal william levada to the cardinal secretary of state tarcisio bertone nit was delivered to me one month later on may 24 2008 nthe following day i delivered a new memo to the new substitute fernando filoni which included my previous one of december 6 2006 nin it i summarized richard sipe xe2 x80 x99s document which ended with this respectful and heartfelt appeal to pope benedict xvi xe2 x80 x9ci approach your holiness with due reverence but with the same intensity that motivated peter damian to lay out before your predecessor pope leo ix a description of the condition of the clergy during his time nthe problems he spoke of are similar and as great now in the united states as they were then in rome nif your holiness requests i will personally submit to you documentation of that about which i have spoken xe2 x80 x9d ni ended my memo by repeating to my superiors that i thought it was necessary to intervene as soon as possible by removing the cardinal xe2 x80 x99s hat from cardinal mccarrick and that he should be subjected to the sanctions established by the code of canon law which also provide for reduction to the lay state nthis second memo of mine was also never returned to the personnel office and i was greatly dismayed at my superiors for the inconceivable absence of any measure against the cardinal and for the continuing lack of any communication with me since my first memo in december 2006 nbut finally i learned with certainty through cardinal giovanni battista re thenprefect of the congregation for bishops that richard sipe xe2 x80 x99s courageous and meritorious statement had had the desired result npope benedict had imposed on cardinal mccarrick sanctions similar to those now imposed on him by pope francis the cardinal was to leave the seminary where he was living he was forbidden to celebrate mass in public to participate in public meetings to give lectures to travel with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance ni do not know when pope benedict took these measures against mccarrick whether in 2009 or 2010 because in the meantime i had been transferred to the governorate of vatican city state just as i do not know who was responsible for this incredible delay ni certainly do not believe it was pope benedict who as cardinal had repeatedly denounced the corruption present in the church and in the first months of his pontificate had already taken a firm stand against the admission into seminary of young men with deep homosexual tendencies ni believe it was due to the pope xe2 x80 x99s first collaborator at the time cardinal tarcisio bertone who notoriously favored promoting homosexuals into positions of responsibility and was accustomed to managing the information he thought appropriate to convey to the pope nin any case what is certain is that pope benedict imposed the above canonical sanctions on mccarrick and that they were communicated to him by the apostolic nuncio to the united states pietro sambi nmonsignor jeanfran xc3 xa7ois lantheaume then first counsellor of the nunciature in washington and charg xc3 xa9 d affaires ai nafter the unexpected death of nuncio sambi in baltimore told me when i arrived in washington xe2 x80 x94 and he is ready to testify to it xe2 x80 x94 about a stormy conversation lasting over an hour that nuncio sambi had with cardinal mccarrick whom he had summoned to the nunciature nmonsignor lantheaume told me that xe2 x80 x9cthe nuncio xe2 x80 x99s voice could be heard all the way out in the corridor xe2 x80 x9d npope benedict xe2 x80 x99s same dispositions were then also communicated to me by the new prefect of the congregation for bishops cardinal marc ouellet in november 2011 in a conversation before my departure for washington and were included among the instructions of the same congregation to the new nuncio nin turn i repeated them to cardinal mccarrick at my first meeting with him at the nunciature nthe cardinal muttering in a barely comprehensible way admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house but he said this as if it had no importance nthe faithful insistently wonder how it was possible for him to be appointed to washington and as cardinal and they have every right to know who knew and who covered up his grave misdeeds nit is therefore my duty to reveal what i know about this beginning with the roman curia ncardinal angelo sodano was secretary of state until september 2006 all information was communicated to him nin november 2000 nunzio montalvo sent him his report passing on to him the aforementioned letter from father boniface ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by mccarrick nit is known that sodano tried to cover up the father maciel scandal to the end nhe even removed the nuncio in mexico city justo mullor who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover maciel and in his place appointed sandri thennuncio to venezuela who was willing to collaborate in the coverup nsodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed that is that pope benedict had decided that the maciel case should be considered closed nbenedict reacted despite sodano xe2 x80 x99s strenuous defense and maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned nwas mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s appointment to washington and as cardinal the work of sodano when john paul ii was already very ill nwe are not given to know nhowever it is legitimate to think so but i do not think he was the only one responsible for this nmccarrick frequently went to rome and made friends everywhere at all levels of the curia nif sodano had protected maciel as seems certain there is no reason why he wouldn xe2 x80 x99t have done so for mccarrick who according to many had the financial means to influence decisions nhis nomination to washington was opposed by thenprefect of the congregation for bishops cardinal giovanni battista re nat the nunciature in washington there is a note written in his hand in which cardinal re disassociates himself from the appointment and states that mccarrick was 14th on the list for washington nnuncio sambi xe2 x80 x99s report with all the attachments was sent to cardinal tarcisio bertone as secretary of state nmy two abovementioned memos of december 6 2006 and may 25 2008 were also presumably handed over to him by the substitute nas already mentioned the cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals xe2 x80 x94 i cite only the wellknown case of vincenzo de mauro who was appointed archbishopbishop of vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians xe2 x80 x94 and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to pope benedict ncardinal pietro parolin the current secretary of state was also complicit in covering up the misdeeds of mccarrick who had after the election of pope francis boasted openly of his travels and missions to various continents nin april 2014 the washington times had a front page report on mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s trip to the central african republic and on behalf of the state department no less nas nuncio to washington i wrote to cardinal parolin asking him if the sanctions imposed on mccarrick by pope benedict were still valid n xc3 x87a va sans dire that my letter never received any reply nthe same can be said for cardinal william levada former prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith for cardinals marc ouellet prefect of the congregation for bishops lorenzo baldisseri former secretary of the same congregation for bishops and archbishop ilson de jesus montanari current secretary of the same congregation nthey were all aware by reason of their office of the sanctions imposed by pope benedict on mccarrick ncardinals leonardo sandri fernando filoni and angelo becciu as substitutes of the secretariat of state knew in every detail the situation regarding cardinal mccarrick nnor could cardinals giovanni lajolo and dominique mamberti have failed to know nas secretaries for relations with states they participated several times a week in collegial meetings with the secretary of state nas far as the roman curia is concerned for the moment i will stop here even if the names of other prelates in the vatican are well known even some very close to pope francis such as cardinal francesco coccopalmerio and archbishop vincenzo paglia who belong to the homosexual current in favor of subverting catholic doctrine on homosexuality a current already denounced in 1986 by cardinal joseph ratzinger thenprefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in the letter to the bishops of the catholic church on the pastoral care of homosexual persons ncardinals edwin frederick o xe2 x80 x99brien and renato raffaele martino also belong to the same current albeit with a different ideology nothers belonging to this current even reside at the domus sanctae marthae nnow to the united states nobviously the first to have been informed of the measures taken by pope benedict was mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s successor in washington see cardinal donald wuerl whose situation is now completely compromised by the recent revelations regarding his behavior as bishop of pittsburgh nit is absolutely unthinkable that nunzio sambi who was an extremely responsible person loyal direct and explicit in his way of being a true son of romagna did not speak to him about it nin any case i myself brought up the subject with cardinal wuerl on several occasions and i certainly didn xe2 x80 x99t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it ni also remember in particular the fact that i had to draw his attention to it because i realized that in an archdiocesan publication on the back cover in color there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with cardinal mccarrick ni immediately phoned cardinal wuerl who expressed his surprise to me telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it nif as he now continues to state he knew nothing of the abuses committed by mccarrick and the measures taken by pope benedict how can his answer be explained nhis recent statements that he knew nothing about it even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims are absolutely laughable nthe cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his chancellor monsignor antonicelli to lie as well ncardinal wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion nfollowing a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of georgetown university i brought it to the attention of its president dr john degioia sending him two subsequent letters nbefore forwarding them to the addressee so as to handle things properly i personally gave a copy of them to the cardinal with an accompanying letter i had written nthe cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it nhowever he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters contrary to what he customarily did ni subsequently learned that the event at georgetown had taken place for seven years nbut the cardinal knew nothing about it ncardinal wuerl well aware of the continuous abuses committed by cardinal mccarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by pope benedict transgressing the pope xe2 x80 x99s order also allowed him to reside at a seminary in washington dc nin doing so he put other seminarians at risk nbishop paul bootkoski emeritus of metuchen and archbishop john myers emeritus of newark covered up the abuses committed by mccarrick in their respective dioceses and compensated two of his victims nthey cannot deny it and they must be interrogated in order to reveal every circumstance and all responsibility regarding this matter ncardinal kevin farrell who was recently interviewed by the media also said that he didn xe2 x80 x99t have the slightest idea about the abuses committed by mccarrick ngiven his tenure in washington dallas and now rome i think no one can honestly believe him ni don xe2 x80 x99t know if he was ever asked if he knew about maciel xe2 x80 x99s crimes nif he were to deny this would anybody believe him given that he occupied positions of responsibility as a member of the legionaries of christ nregarding cardinal sean o xe2 x80 x99malley i would simply say that his latest statements on the mccarrick case are disconcerting and have totally obscured his transparency and credibility n   nmy conscience requires me also to reveal facts that i have experienced personally concerning pope francis that have a dramatic significance which as bishop sharing the collegial responsibility of all the bishops for the universal church do not allow me to remain silent and that i state here ready to reaffirm them under oath by calling on god as my witness nin the last months of his pontificate pope benedict xvi had convened a meeting of all the apostolic nuncios in rome as paul vi and st john paul ii had done on several occasions nthe date set for the audience with the pope was friday june 21 2013 npope francis kept this commitment made by his predecessor nof course i also came to rome from washington nit was my first meeting with the new pope elected only three months prior after the resignation of pope benedict non the morning of thursday june 20 2013 i went to the domus sanctae marthae to join my colleagues who were staying there nas soon as i entered the hall i met cardinal mccarrick who wore the redtrimmed cassock ni greeted him respectfully as i had always done nhe immediately said to me in a tone somewhere between ambiguous and triumphant xe2 x80 x9cthe pope received me yesterday tomorrow i am going to china xe2 x80 x9d nat the time i knew nothing of his long friendship with cardinal bergoglio and of the important part he had played in his recent election as mccarrick himself would later reveal in a lecture at villanova university and in an interview with the national catholic reporter nnor had i ever thought of the fact that he had participated in the preliminary meetings of the recent conclave and of the role he had been able to have as a cardinal elector in the 2005 conclave ntherefore i did not immediately grasp the meaning of the encrypted message that mccarrick had communicated to me but that would become clear to me in the days immediately following nthe next day the audience with pope francis took place nafter his address which was partly read and partly delivered off the cuff the pope wished to greet all the nuncios one by one nin single file i remember that i was among the last nwhen it was my turn i just had time to say to him xe2 x80 x9ci am the nuncio to the united states xe2 x80 x9d he immediately assailed me with a tone of reproach using these words xe2 x80 x9cthe bishops in the united states must not be ideologized nthey must be shepherds xe2 x80 x9dof course i was not in a position to ask for explanations about the meaning of his words and the aggressive way in which he had upbraided me ni had in my hand a book in portuguese that cardinal o xe2 x80 x99malley had sent me for the pope a few days earlier telling me xe2 x80 x9cso he could go over his portuguese before going to rio for world youth day xe2 x80 x9d i handed it to him immediately and so freed myself from that extremely disconcerting and embarrassing situation nat the end of the audience the pope announced xe2 x80 x9cthose of you who are still in rome next sunday are invited to concelebrate with me at the domus sanctae marthae xe2 x80 x9d i naturally thought of staying on to clarify as soon as possible what the pope intended to tell me non sunday june 23 before the concelebration with the pope i asked monsignor ricca who as the person in charge of the house helped us put on the vestments if he could ask the pope if he could receive me sometime in the following week nhow could i have returned to washington without having clarified what the pope wanted of me nat the end of mass while the pope was greeting the few lay people present monsignor fabian pedacchio his argentine secretary came to me and said xe2 x80 x9cthe pope told me to ask if you are free now xe2 x80 x9d naturally i replied that i was at the pope xe2 x80 x99s disposal and that i thanked him for receiving me immediately nthe pope took me to the first floor in his apartment and said xe2 x80 x9cwe have 40 minutes before the angelus xe2 x80 x9d ni began the conversation asking the pope what he intended to say to me with the words he had addressed to me when i greeted him the previous friday nand the pope in a very different friendly almost affectionate tone said to me xe2 x80 x9cyes the bishops in the united states must not be ideologized they must not be rightwing like the archbishop of philadelphia the pope did not give me the name of the archbishop they must be shepherds and they must not be leftwing xe2 x80 x94 and he added raising both arms xe2 x80 x94 and when i say leftwing i mean homosexual xe2 x80 x9d of course the logic of the correlation between being leftwing and being homosexual escaped me but i added nothing else nimmediately after the pope asked me in a deceitful way xe2 x80 x9cwhat is cardinal mccarrick like xe2 x80 x9d i answered him with complete frankness and if you want with great naivet xc3 xa9 xe2 x80 x9choly father i don xe2 x80 x99t know if you know cardinal mccarrick but if you ask the congregation for bishops there is a dossier this thick about him nhe corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and pope benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance xe2 x80 x9d the pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face as if he had already known the matter for some time and he immediately changed the subject nbut then what was the pope xe2 x80 x99s purpose in asking me that question xe2 x80 x9cwhat is cardinal mccarrick like xe2 x80 x9d he clearly wanted to find out if i was an ally of mccarrick or not nback in washington everything became very clear to me thanks also to a new event that occurred only a few days after my meeting with pope francis nwhen the new bishop mark seitz took possession of the diocese of el paso on july 9 2013 i sent the first counsellor monsignor jeanfran xc3 xa7ois lantheaume while i went to dallas that same day for an international meeting on bioethics nwhen he got back monsignor lantheaume told me that in el paso he had met cardinal mccarrick who taking him aside told him almost the same words that the pope had said to me in rome xe2 x80 x9cthe bishops in the united states must not be ideologized they must not be rightwing they must be shepherds xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d i was astounded nit was therefore clear that the words of reproach that pope francis had addressed to me on june 21 2013 had been put into his mouth the day before by cardinal mccarrick nalso the pope xe2 x80 x99s mention xe2 x80 x9cnot like the archbishop of philadelphia xe2 x80 x9d could be traced to mccarrick because there had been a strong disagreement between the two of them about the admission to communion of proabortion politicians nin his communication to the bishops mccarrick had manipulated a letter of thencardinal ratzinger who prohibited giving them communion nindeed i also knew how certain cardinals such as mahony levada and wuerl were closely linked to mccarrick they had opposed the most recent appointments made by pope benedict for important posts such as philadelphia baltimore denver and san francisco nnot happy with the trap he had set for me on june 23 2013 when he asked me about mccarrick only a few months later in the audience he granted me on october 10 2013 pope francis set a second one for me this time concerning a second of his prot xc3 xa9g xc3 xa9s cardinal donald wuerl nhe asked me xe2 x80 x9cwhat is cardinal wuerl like is he good or bad xe2 x80 x9d i replied xe2 x80 x9choly father i will not tell you if he is good or bad but i will tell you two facts xe2 x80 x9d they are the ones i have already mentioned above which concern wuerl xe2 x80 x99s pastoral carelessness regarding the aberrant deviations at georgetown university and the invitation by the archdiocese of washington to young aspirants to the priesthood to a meeting with mccarrick nonce again the pope did not show any reaction nit was also clear that from the time of pope francis xe2 x80 x99s election mccarrick now free from all constraints had felt free to travel continuously to give lectures and interviews nin a team effort with cardinal rodriguez maradiaga he had become the kingmaker for appointments in the curia and the united states and the most listened to advisor in the vatican for relations with the obama administration nthis is how one explains that as members of the congregation for bishops the pope replaced cardinal burke with wuerl and immediately appointed cupich right after he was made a cardinal nwith these appointments the nunciature in washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops nin addition he appointed the brazilian ilson de jesus montanari xe2 x80 x94 the great friend of his private argentine secretary fabian pedacchio xe2 x80 x94 as secretary of the same congregation for bishops and secretary of the college of cardinals promoting him in one single leap from a simple official of that department to archbishop secretary nsomething unprecedented for such an important position nthe appointments of blase cupich to chicago and joseph w tobin to newark were orchestrated by mccarrick maradiaga and wuerl united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two ntheir names were not among those presented by the nunciature for chicago and newark nregarding cupich one cannot fail to note his ostentatious arrogance and the insolence with which he denies the evidence that is now obvious to all that 80 of the abuses found were committed against young adults by homosexuals who were in a relationship of authority over their victims nduring the speech he gave when he took possession of the chicago see at which i was present as a representative of the pope cupich quipped that one certainly should not expect the new archbishop to walk on water nperhaps it would be enough for him to be able to remain with his feet on the ground and not try to turn reality upsidedown blinded by his progay ideology as he stated in a recent interview with america magazine nextolling his particular expertise in the matter having been president of the committee on protection of children and young people of the usccb he asserted that the main problem in the crisis of sexual abuse by clergy is not homosexuality and that affirming this is only a way of diverting attention from the real problem which is clericalism nin support of this thesis cupich xe2 x80 x9coddly xe2 x80 x9d made reference to the results of research carried out at the height of the sexual abuse of minors crisis in the early 2000s while he xe2 x80 x9ccandidly xe2 x80 x9d ignored that the results of that investigation were totally denied by the subsequent independent reports by the john jay college of criminal justice in 2004 and 2011 which concluded that in cases of sexual abuse 81 of the victims were male nin fact father hans zollner sj vicerector of the pontifical gregorian university president of the centre for child protection and member of the pontifical commission for the protection of minors recently told the newspaper la stampa that xe2 x80 x9cin most cases it is a question of homosexual abuse xe2 x80 x9d nthe appointment of mcelroy in san diego was also orchestrated from above with an encrypted peremptory order to me as nuncio by cardinal parolin xe2 x80 x9creserve the see of san diego for mcelroy xe2 x80 x9d mcelroy was also well aware of mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s abuses as can be seen from a letter sent to him by richard sipe on july 28 2016 nthese characters are closely associated with individuals belonging in particular to the deviated wing of the society of jesus unfortunately today a majority which had already been a cause of serious concern to paul vi and subsequent pontiffs nwe need only consider father robert drinan sj who was elected four times to the house of representatives and was a staunch supporter of abortion or father vincent o xe2 x80 x99keefe sj one of the principal promoters of the land o xe2 x80 x99lakes statement of 1967 which seriously compromised the catholic identity of universities and colleges in the united states nit should be noted that mccarrick then president of the catholic university of puerto rico also participated in that inauspicious undertaking which was so harmful to the formation of the consciences of american youth closely associated as it was with the deviated wing of the jesuits nfather james martin sj acclaimed by the people mentioned above in particular cupich tobin farrell and mcelroy appointed consultor of the secretariat for communications wellknown activist who promotes the lgbt agenda chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in dublin for the world meeting of families is nothing but a sad recent example of that deviated wing of the society of jesus npope francis has repeatedly asked for total transparency in the church and for bishops and faithful to act with parrhesia nthe faithful throughout the world also demand this of him in an exemplary manner nhe must honestly state when he first learned about the crimes committed by mccarrick who abused his authority with seminarians and priests nin any case the pope learned about it from me on june 23 2013 and continued to cover for him nhe did not take into account the sanctions that pope benedict had imposed on him and made him his trusted counselor along with maradiaga nthe latter maradiaga is so confident of the pope xe2 x80 x99s protection that he can dismiss as xe2 x80 x9cgossip xe2 x80 x9d the heartfelt appeals of dozens of his seminarians who found the courage to write to him after one of them tried to commit suicide over homosexual abuse in the seminary nby now the faithful have well understood maradiaga xe2 x80 x99s strategy insult the victims to save himself lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power of mismanagement in the administration of church property and of financial disasters even against close friends as in the case of the ambassador of honduras alejandro valladares former dean of the diplomatic corps to the holy see nin the case of the former auxiliary bishop juan jos xc3 xa9 pineda after the article published in the italian weekly l xe2 x80 x99espresso last february maradiaga stated in the newspaper avvenire xe2 x80 x9cit was my auxiliary bishop pineda who asked for the visitation so as to xe2 x80 x98clear xe2 x80 x99 his name after being subjected to much slander xe2 x80 x9d now regarding pineda the only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted thus making any possible responsibility of his and maradiaga vanish into nowhere nin the name of the transparency so hailed by the pope the report that the visitator argentine bishop alcides casaretto delivered more than a year ago only and directly to the pope must be made public nfinally the recent appointment as substitute of archbishop edgar pe xc3 xb1a parra is also connected with honduras that is with maradiaga nfrom 2003 to 2007 pe xc3 xb1a parra worked as counsellor at the tegucigalpa nunciature nas delegate for pontifical representations i received worrisome information about him nin honduras a scandal as huge as the one in chile is about to be repeated nthe pope defends his man cardinal rodriguez maradiaga to the bitter end as he had done in chile with bishop juan de la cruz barros whom he himself had appointed bishop of osorno against the advice of the chilean bishops nfirst he insulted the abuse victims nthen only when he was forced by the media and a revolt by the chilean victims and faithful did he recognize his error and apologize while stating that he had been misinformed causing a disastrous situation for the church in chile but continuing to protect the two chilean cardinals errazuriz and ezzati neven in the tragic affair of mccarrick pope francis xe2 x80 x99s behavior was no different nhe knew from at least june 23 2013 that mccarrick was a serial predator nalthough he knew that he was a corrupt man he covered for him to the bitter end indeed he made mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s advice his own which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the church nit was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor again on the basis of media attention that he took action regarding mccarrick to save his image in the media nnow in the united states a chorus of voices is rising especially from the lay faithful and has recently been joined by several bishops and priests asking that all those who by their silence covered up mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s criminal behavior or who used him to advance their career or promote their intentions ambitions and power in the church should resign nbut this will not be enough to heal the situation of extremely grave immoral behavior by the clergy bishops and priests na time of conversion and penance must be proclaimed nthe virtue of chastity must be recovered in the clergy and in seminaries ncorruption in the misuse of the church xe2 x80 x99s resources and of the offerings of the faithful must be fought against nthe seriousness of homosexual behavior must be denounced nthe homosexual networks present in the church must be eradicated as janet smith professor of moral theology at the sacred heart major seminary in detroit recently wrote n xe2 x80 x9cthe problem of clergy abuse xe2 x80 x9d she wrote xe2 x80 x9ccannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops and even less so by bureaucratic directives nthe deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated xe2 x80 x9d these homosexual networks which are now widespread in many dioceses seminaries religious orders etc act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations and are strangling the entire church ni implore everyone especially bishops to speak up in order to defeat this conspiracy of silence that is so widespread and to report the cases of abuse they know about to the media and civil authorities nlet us heed the most powerful message that st john paul ii left us as an inheritancedo not be afraid ndo not be afraid nin his 2008 homily on the feast of the epiphany pope benedict reminded us that the father xe2 x80 x99s plan of salvation had been fully revealed and realized in the mystery of christ xe2 x80 x99s death and resurrection but it needs to be welcomed in human history which is always a history of fidelity on god xe2 x80 x99s part and unfortunately also of infidelity on the part of us men nthe church the depositary of the blessing of the new covenant signed in the blood of the lamb is holy but made up of sinners as saint ambrose wrote the church is xe2 x80 x9cimmaculata ex maculatis xe2 x80 x9d she is holy and spotless even though in her earthly journey she is made up of men stained with sin ni want to recall this indefectible truth of the church xe2 x80 x99s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former archbishop of washington theodore mccarrick by the grave disconcerting and sinful conduct of pope francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors and who are tempted to abandon the church disfigured by so many ignominies nat the angelus on sunday august 12 2018 pope francis said these words xe2 x80 x9ceveryone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do  nif we do not oppose evil we tacitly feed it nwe need to intervene where evil is spreading for evil spreads where daring christians who oppose evil with good are lacking xe2 x80 x9d if this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer how much graver is it for the church xe2 x80 x99s supreme pastor who in the case of mccarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt nhe followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by mccarrick nand how many other evil pastors is francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the church nfrancis is abdicating the mandate which christ gave to peter to confirm the brethren nindeed by his action he has divided them led them into error and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of christ xe2 x80 x99s flock nin this extremely dramatic moment for the universal church he must acknowledge his mistakes and in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance pope francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s abuses and resign along with all of them neven in dismay and sadness over the enormity of what is happening let us not lose hope nwe well know that the great majority of our pastors live their priestly vocation with fidelity and dedication nit is in moments of great trial that the lord xe2 x80 x99s grace is revealed in abundance and makes his limitless mercy available to all but it is granted only to those who are truly repentant and sincerely propose to amend their lives nthis is a favorable time for the church to confess her sins to convert and to do penance nlet us all pray for the church and for the pope let us remember how many times he has asked us to pray for him nlet us all renew faith in the church our mother xe2 x80 x9ci believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church xe2 x80 x9d nchrist will never abandon his church nhe generated her in his blood and continually revives her with his spirit nmary mother of the church pray for us nmary virgin and queen mother of the king of glory pray for us nrome august 22 2018 nqueenship of the blessed virgin mary nofficial

state xe2 x80 xa6requires the conquest of america britain russia france and italy xe2 x80 x93 rome and other infidel lands will be conquered allah willing xe2 x80 x9d naccording to the middle east media research institute memri khecharem also said xe2 x80 x9cafter the laws of allah were abandoned and the heretic regimes were imposed on the muslims the most important thing to do is to restore the rule of the muslims through the quran and the sunna in order to renew islamic life and to deliver the islamic message to the world nmy brothers the implication of this today should be the establishment of an islamic state over all the lands of the muslims xe2 x80 x9d n xef xbb xbf ntake our poll  story continues below nwill brett kavanaugh be confirmed to the supreme court nwill brett

xe2 x80 x9cthis will happen of course after the elimination of the filthy jewish entity and after liberation of the lands under direct colonization like kashmir and others xe2 x80 x9d nif said khecharem were a nonmuslim saying that muslims needed to destroy xe2 x80 x9cthe filthy jewish entity xe2 x80 x9d and conquer america britain russia france and italy he would be accused of xe2 x80 x9cislamophobia xe2 x80 x9d and xe2 x80 x9cbigotry xe2 x80 x9d but no one will take any particular notice of this nthey should however nkhecharem is not some deluded fanatic raving on a tunisian street corner nhe was speaking at hizb uttahrir xe2 x80 x99s international caliphate conference although hizb uttahrir is banned in many countries it still has an international presence and recently held a conference in chicago nnor is the desire to establish a global caliphate limited to hizb uttahrir alone nthe word khalifa means xe2 x80 x9csuccessor xe2 x80 x9d the caliph in sunni islamic theology is the successor of muhammad as the military political and spiritual leader of the muslims nas i show in my book the history of jihad from muhammad to isis  the great caliphates of history from the immediate postmuhammad period of the xe2 x80 x9crightly guided caliphs xe2 x80 x9d to the umayyads abbasids and ottomans as well as other islamic states all waged relentless jihad warfare against nonmuslims subjugating them under the rule of islamic law and denying them basic rights nthese weren xe2 x80 x99t the actions of a xe2 x80 x9ctiny minority of extremists xe2 x80 x9d abhorred by the vast majority of peaceful muslims for xe2 x80 x9chijacking xe2 x80 x9d their religion nthis was for fourteen centuries mainstream normative islam carried forth by the primary authorities in the islamic world at the time nthe history of jihad shows from the accounts of eyewitnesses and contemporary chroniclers through the ages that in every age and in every place where there were muslims some of them believed that they had a responsibility given to them by allah to wage war against and subjugate unbelievers under the rule of islamic law nand so it is today said khecharem has enunciated that responsibility more clearly and directly than most muslim spokesmen do these days but he is by no means the only one who believes that it exists nwhat is noteworthy also about the history of jihad is something that it does not contain nas the jihadis move against nonmuslim states without any letup pause period of coexistence period of tolerance reformation or reconsideration there never appears any force of muslims to oppose them nwhile it is undoubtedly true that not all muslims in any given age have ever waged jihad there has never been in islamic history an islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad and dedicated to stopping those who were waging it nso it is today nislamic groups in the west issue proforma condemnations after every jihad terror attack but are doing little or nothing to try to prevent the next one nthere is still no mosque or islamic school in the united states that teaches young muslims why they should reject the

297,archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 speaks the neocatholics panic n nin his elevenpage account affirmed under oath the archbishop marking a turning point in church history declares that senior vatican officials including former secretaries of state angelo sodano and tarcisio bertone as well as cardinal xc3 x93scar andr xc3 xa9s rodr xc3 xadguez maradiaga coordinator of pope bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9ccouncil of cardinals xe2 x80 x9d covered up mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s decades of sexual predation and that bergoglio himself continued the coverup nthis article was first written to address the neocatholic commentator massimo faggioli xe2 x80 x99s attempt  following the pennsylvania grand jury report and the fall of excardinal theodore mccarrick to minimize the homosexual crisis in the church and blunt the correlative rise of what he derides as xe2 x80 x9cneotraditionalism xe2 x80 x9d as my piece was about to go to press however ewtn xe2 x80 x99s national catholic register broke the explosive story on the written testimony of archbishop carlo maria vigan xc3 xb2  former apostolic nuncio to the united states 2011 to 2016 nfaggioli xe2 x80 x99s propaganda piece now becomes merely illustrative of the points to be made here in light of this astonishing and indeed providential development nregarding bergoglio vigan xc3 xb2 testifies that in 2013 he personally informed him about mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s history the dossier of the congregation for bishops on his sexual crimes against boys and young men and the disciplinary sanctions imposed upon him by benedict xvi forbidding residence in a seminary public appearances and masses nevidently already aware of these facts however bergoglio not only rehabilitated mccarrick but made him a xe2 x80 x9ctrusted counselor xe2 x80 x9d who advised the elevation of the prohomosexual prelates blase cupich joseph tobin and kevin farrell to the college of cardinals and the prominent episcopal sees they now discredit nall of this happened before bergoglio bowing to worldwide public pressure finally xe2 x80 x94only weeks ago xe2 x80 x94took decisive action against his xe2 x80 x9ctrusted counselor xe2 x80 x9d mccarrick had lobbied for bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s election along with maradiaga and the infamous cardinal danneels who covered up homosexual rape committed by a priest against his own nephewhas supported xe2 x80 x9csamesex marriage xe2 x80 x9d and advised the king of belgium to sign a law legalizing abortion in 1990 nas edward pentin notes xe2 x80 x9call 3 prelates have since been special advisors of francis or rehabilitated by him xe2 x80 x9d nvigan xc3 xb2 concludes his testimony by declaring that all of the prelates involved many others are implicated including bergoglio should resign their offices for the good of the church nas to bergoglio in particular he courageously states openly the truth that so many of his brethren know but fear to speak in public ni want to recall this indefectible truth of the church xe2 x80 x99s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former archbishop of washington theodore mccarrick by the grave disconcerting and sinful conduct of pope francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors and who are tempted to abandon the church disfigured by so many ignominies nat the angelus on sunday august 12 2018 pope francis said these words xe2 x80 x9ceveryone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do  nif we do not oppose evil we tacitly feed it nwe need to intervene where evil is spreading for evil spreads where daring christians who oppose evil with good are lacking xe2 x80 x9d emphasis in original if this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer how much graver is it for the church xe2 x80 x99s supreme pastor who in the case of mccarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt nhe followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by mccarrick nand how many other evil pastors is francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the church nmy emphasis francis is abdicating the mandate which christ gave to peter to confirm the brethren nindeed by his action he has divided them led them into error and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of christ xe2 x80 x99s flock nin this extremely dramatic moment for the universal church he must acknowledge his mistakes and in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance pope francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s abuses and resign along with all of them nemphasis in original nbefore he was papal nuncio in washington vigan xc3 xb2 headed the governorate of vatican city state after having served as nuncio in nigeria a delegate for the pontifical representatives of the secretary of state of the holy see and a member of the disciplinary commission of the roman curia nin those capacities he had access to documents and witnesses that corroborate his own firsthand testimony nwith vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s testimony the widespread homosexual infiltration of the postvatican ii hierarchy from the top on down now emerges mountainously into view never to be buried again neven before that testimony however the fall of mccarrick and the pennsylvania grand jury report had already presented a sisyphean task to neocatholic apologists for the decrepit novus ordo status quo and the illstarred council that launched its installation nyet there is little doubt they will continue the same polemic that for nearly sixty years has doggedly defended every one of the ruinous xe2 x80 x9creforms xe2 x80 x9d that have resulted in a debacle without equal in church history even considering the arian crisis of the 4th century nthose xe2 x80 x9creforms xe2 x80 x9d included abandonment of the vatican xe2 x80 x99s strict preconciliar instruction 1961 that xe2 x80 x9cadvancement to religious vows and ordination should be barred to those who are afflicted with evil tendencies to homosexuality or pederasty since for them the common life and the priestly ministry would constitute serious dangers xe2 x80 x9d today neocatholic commentators cowed by the demands of political correctness refuse to state the simple truth that homosexuality is a perversion that precludes ordination as does any other grave psychological disorder nkill the messenger ni suspect that not even vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s historic testimony will change the neocatholic position nquite the contrary i would expect the neocatholic commentariat either to ignore vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s witness explain away his revelations or failing that make every effort to smear the man nthe campaign to discredit archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 began instantaneously on the catholic left wing nonly hours after vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s sworn testimony appeared online the professional catholic dissident sean michael winters writing for national catholic reporter smeared the former apostolic nuncio to the united states who holds doctorates in both civil and canon law as xe2 x80 x9ca trafficker in conspiracy theories who mixes fact fiction and venom xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x9cmore than a little obsessed with homosexuality xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x94like oliver stone who xe2 x80 x9cwas obsessed with the grassy knoll xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x94 xe2 x80 x9ca disgruntled former employee xe2 x80 x9d and xe2 x80 x9calways a crackpot xe2 x80 x9d without addressing the merits winters dismissed archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9cwild claims xe2 x80 x9d about bishops who are xe2 x80 x9csubverting catholic doctrine on homosexuality xe2 x80 x9d and accused the archbishop along with unnamed other bishops and archbishops of xe2 x80 x9cspeaking about gay people with such hatred xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d nwinters issues the dire warning that xe2 x80 x9ca putsch is afoot and if the us bishops do not as a body stand up to defend the holy father in the next 24 hours we shall be slipping towards schism long before the bishops xe2 x80 x99 meeting in november nthe enemies of francis have declared war xe2 x80 x9d notice that for winters it is not the church or the integrity of her doctrine and discipline that must be defended against enemies but only bergoglio and the regime of novelty he is leading to its final extremity njohn allen xe2 x80 x99s instant analysis attempting to impeach vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s testimony is as one would expect from him a bit craftier nhis opinion is xe2 x80 x9ctake it seriously but with a large grain of salt xe2 x80 x9d which is just allen xe2 x80 x99s more nuanced way of saying xe2 x80 x9cdon xe2 x80 x99t believe it xe2 x80 x9d allen xe2 x80 x99s view is supported by such irrelevancies as the fact that vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s account implicates xe2 x80 x9cno fewer than 32 senior churchmen xe2 x80 x9d so what n that he xe2 x80 x9chas a history xe2 x80 x9d of xe2 x80 x9cinnuendo and conspiracy theories xe2 x80 x9d a gratuitous assertion unsupported by evidence of falsity that he allegedly quashed an investigation of archbishop john nienstedt and ordered evidence destroyed an allegation vigan xc3 xb2 has immediately and categorically denied with conclusive supporting documents but in any event a tuo quoque fallacy and that allen has xe2 x80 x9cthe impression that all this was orchestrated with a political agenda in mind xe2 x80 x9d the same xe2 x80 x9cconspiracy theory xe2 x80 x9d mentality he gratuitously attributes to vigan xc3 xb2 nmark shea easily the most insufferable of the neocatholic polemicists has quickly followed winters and allen in trying to cast doubt on vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s claims nignoring eleven pages of detail written and published under oath he suggests there has been no xe2 x80 x9cdocumentation nevidence nproof xe2 x80 x9d yes francis should resign if vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s allegations are true shea admits xe2 x80 x94a stunning concession coming from him nyet making no attempt to refute vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s account on the merits he tries to wave it all aside with his usual mode of argument xe2 x80 x94puerile mockery xe2 x80 x9cbut at present the eagerness of the greatest catholics of all time to believe and repeat everything their itching ears want to hear about this pope whose living guts they have hated from the moment of his election only tells in his favor not against it xe2 x80 x9d shea xe2 x80 x99s everexpanding opus of digital invective never seems to rise above this sort of crude ad hominem attack well if those people believe it it can xe2 x80 x99t be true nthe neocatholic propaganda mill will have a very difficult time smearing this witness however nspeaking to catholic news agency monsignor jeanfran xc3 xa7ois lantheaume who served as first counsellor of the nunciature in washington confirmed that xe2 x80 x9cvigan xc3 xb2 said the truth nthat xe2 x80 x99s all xe2 x80 x9d when he stated in his sworn account that nuncio pietro sambi conveyed to mccarrick at the nunciature in washington the sanctions that had been imposed on him by pope benedict xe2 x80 x94sanctions bergoglio ignored for five years until forced to act by a worldwide storm of outrage nfurthermore a series of prelates has vouched for vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s character and credibility n bishop joseph strickland of tyler texas has gone so far as to order all the priests in his diocese to read from the pulpit a statement that he finds vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s allegations credible n bishop thomas olmsted of phoenix arizona issued a statement affirming that he has known vigan xc3 xb2 for 39 years has xe2 x80 x9calways known and respected him as a man of truthfulness faith and integrity xe2 x80 x9d and that his testimony should xe2 x80 x9cbe taken seriously by all xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d n archbishop allen vigneron of detroit michigan issued a statement calling vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s account xe2 x80 x9canother daunting challenge to our confidence in the reliability of the church xe2 x80 x99s leadership during a summer of devastating news regarding clergy sexual abuse and infidelity xe2 x80 x9d the statement has since apparently been scrubbed from the diocesan website n bishop athanasius schneider declares xe2 x80 x9carchbishop vigan xc3 xb2 confirmed his statement by a sacred oath invoking the name of god nthere is therefore no reasonable and plausible cause to doubt the truth content of the document of archbishop carlo maria vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x9d n cardinal raymond burke xe2 x80 x99s statement declares xe2 x80 x9cthe declarations made by a prelate of the authority of archbishop carlo maria vigan xc3 xb2 must be totally taken to heart by those responsible in the church xe2 x80 x9d n and just two days ago archbishop salvatore cordileone of san francisco wrote a letter to his faithful which speaks to vigano  integrity and sincere love of the church nin another setback for the propaganda machine gearing up to impeach vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s testimony the catholic herald has just reported that cardinal wuerl must have known full well from vigan xc3 xb2 himself that mccarrick was under pope benedict xe2 x80 x99s papal sanctions on account of his sexual misconduct because as an archdiocesan spokesman now confirms at vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s request as then papal nuncio wuerl had to cancel a public appearance by mccarrick not long before bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s election nthe herald asks the obvious question xe2 x80 x9cif cardinal wuerl was unaware of the sanctions and unaware of the reason for them why did he ask no questions of the nuncio regarding the reason for his demand xe2 x80 x9d the question answers itself and vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s testimony on this critical point stands confirmed by wuerl xe2 x80 x99s own spokesman nbergoglio pleads the fifth nbergoglio himself however has already precluded any attempt to impeach vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s testimony nduring the return flight from dublin after the xe2 x80 x9cworld meeting of familes xe2 x80 x9d he was asked to comment on vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s allegations that he had informed bergoglio of mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s crimes in 2013 as well as the sanctions imposed by benedict nbergoglio declined to incriminate himself nread the statement carefully yourselves and make your own judgment ni am not going to say a word about this ni believe that the statement speaks for itself and you all have sufficient journalistic ability to draw conclusions nit is an act of trust nwhen a little time goes by and you have drawn conclusions perhaps i will speak about it but i would like your professional maturity to do this work nit will do you all good really nin other words as bergoglio cannot deny the allegations without lying he will say nothing at all about them in the hope they will go away xe2 x80 x94with the help of sycophants in the vatican press corps and shifty polemicists like shea who expects his readers to swallow his explanation that bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s refusal to say anything in his defense when asked point blank about the charges against him xe2 x80 x9cseems to me to obviously be the reply of somebody who believes the accusations are groundless xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d nseems to be nobviously nthe american xe2 x80 x9cgay xe2 x80 x9d church expansion nwhile events have overtaken faggioli xe2 x80 x99s piece it will remain useful here as a prime example of the neocatholic polemic nthat polemic seeks to shore up the collapsing novus ordo establishment lest it give way to the dreaded traditionalist revival nbut before i address faggioli xe2 x80 x99s latest defense of the indefensible some background is in order including a discussion of further key details of vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s testimony nfirst of all as i predicted 16 years ago because the vatican under john paul ii had no intention of enforcing the preconciliar ban on admission of homosexuals to the seminary xe2 x80 x9ca new bumper crop of homosexual ordinands is guaranteed xe2 x80 x94and with it a new harvest of scandal for the church xe2 x80 x9d that prediction came immediately after the xe2 x80 x9cpedophile summit xe2 x80 x9d of 2002 in rome which i attended as the remnant xe2 x80 x99s correspondent nin answer to my question then head of the usccb wilton gregory made an explosive admission reportedby the international press xe2 x80 x9cit is an ongoing struggle to make sure that the catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men xe2 x80 x9d the struggle to the extent there even was one obviously has been lost nsixteen years later the homosexual predator mccarrick has finally been exposed to the world stripped of his cardinal xe2 x80 x99s hat and deprived of any ministry but only after international media coverage of the vatican xe2 x80 x99s semisecret finding that mccarrick had raped a teenage altar boy 47 years ago nif not for that one case mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s sixty years of homosexual debauchery might well have gone unpunished in this world and he would have died still possessed of all the phony honors that had been heaped upon him throughout his career as a parasite in the body of christ including the favor shown to him by bergoglio nthe telling details of archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s testimony concerning bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s friendly relations with mccarrick before he finally had to cut him loose xe2 x80 x94details conveniently ignored by winters allen and shea xe2 x80 x94are utterly devastating to any defense of bergoglio nthis would explain why he will not a xe2 x80 x9csay a word about xe2 x80 x9d vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s charges against him nthe archbishop reveals as already noted that pope benedict imposed sanctions on mccarrick under which he xe2 x80 x9cwas to leave the seminary where he was living he was forbidden to celebrate mass in public to participate in public meetings to give lectures to travel with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance xe2 x80 x9d vigan xc3 xb2 further reveals that those sanctions were communicated to mccarrick by then apostolic nuncio to the united states pietro sambi but were also repeated by vigan xc3 xb2 himself when he succeeded sambi as nuncio ni repeated them to cardinal mccarrick at my first meeting with him at the nunciature nthe cardinal muttering in a barely comprehensible way admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house but he said this as if it had no importance nvigan xc3 xb2 testifies that on june 23 2013 he obtained a private audience with bergoglio after having encountered mccarrick at the pope xe2 x80 x99s residence three days earlier during which encounter mccarrick had told him with an air of triumph xe2 x80 x9cthe pope received me yesterday tomorrow i am going to china xe2 x80 x9d evidently to assist in negotiating bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s planned sellout of china xe2 x80 x99s underground catholics to the communist dictators of beijing nvigan xc3 xb2 wanted to know why mccarrick had apparently been relieved of the sanctions nduring the audience bergoglio queried xe2 x80 x9cwhat is cardinal mccarrick like xe2 x80 x9d and vigan xc3 xb2 replied with the truth bergoglio obviously did not want to hear ni answered him with complete frankness and if you want with great naivet xc3 xa9 xe2 x80 x9choly father i don xe2 x80 x99t know if you know cardinal mccarrick but if you ask the congregation for bishops there is a dossier this thick about him nhe corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and pope benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance xe2 x80 x9d the pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face as if he had already known the matter for some time and he immediately changed the subject nbut then what was the pope xe2 x80 x99s purpose in asking me that question xe2 x80 x9cwhat is cardinal mccarrick like xe2 x80 x9d he clearly wanted to find out if i was an ally of mccarrick or not xe2 x80 xa6 nit was also clear that from the time of pope francis xe2 x80 x99s election mccarrick now free from all constraints had felt free to travel continuously to give lectures and interviews xe2 x80 xa6 nhe bergoglio knew from at least june 23 2013 the date of the audience with vigan xc3 xb2 that mccarrick was a serial predator nalthough he knew that he was a corrupt man he covered for him to the bitter end indeed he made mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s advice his own which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the church nit was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor again on the basis of media attention that he took action to save his image in the media nall emphasis in original nbefore his long overdue fall mccarrick as bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9ctrusted counselor xe2 x80 x9d had been instrumental in cementing into place the homosexualfriendly status quo of the american episcopate that oppresses and defrauds the faithful nit was mccarrick noted marco tosatti who was behind the elevation of blase cupich to the key position of archbishop of chicago where cupich has since promoted the homosexual subversion of father james martin nand vigan xc3 xb2 now confirms tosatti xe2 x80 x99s allegation xe2 x80 x9cthe appointments of blase cupich to chicago and joseph w tobin to newark were orchestrated by mccarrick maradiaga and wuerl united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two ntheir names were not among those presented by the nunciature for chicago and newark xe2 x80 x9d that is the normal process was circumvented for these appointments nremnant readers may recall that i spotted cupich back in 2002 when he was the obscure bishop of rapid city south dakota as an example of what was coming in the novus ordo accelerated degeneration nas i wrote back then with the likes of cupich in view ncupich is the very model of a novus ordo bishop nhe is the very exemplar of the crisis we must still endure xe2 x80 xa6 nlet the thing die of its own excesses for as the xe2 x80 x9clittle synod xe2 x80 x9d the 2002 xe2 x80 x9cpedophile summit xe2 x80 x9d demonstrates the men who control this establishment will never restore it to anything resembling the vibrant church that a long line of militant uncompromising popes delivered into their hands at vatican ii nfor heaven xe2 x80 x99s sake the men who govern the church today require a vatican summit meeting to agonize over whether serial child molesters should be defrocked nfrom the vatican on down through deliberate decisions and criminal neglect the servitors of vatican ii have laid waste to the liturgy the perennial clarity of catholic teaching the church xe2 x80 x99s militant opposition to worldly thinking the traditional formation in seminaries the religious orders the missions the trust of the faithful in their own priests xe2 x80 x94in short the very life of the church xe2 x80 x94and dare to call it a renewal nwe must no longer subsidize the malpractice of the architects of ruin nnor must we join the neocatholics in their mindless applause when one of these incompetents attempts to repoint a brick or two in the crumbling fa xc3 xa7ade they have erected to obscure the church of old nas for william  xe2 x80 x9cnightynight baby xe2 x80 x9d tobin after mccarrick had arranged for him to become archbishop of newark tobin another episcopal booster of martin xe2 x80 x99s prohomosexual propaganda promptly sponsored a xe2 x80 x9cgay pilgrimage xe2 x80 x9d to his cathedral in newark nand it was mccarrick who obtained the cardinal xe2 x80 x99s hat for his roommate of six years kevin farrell whom he consecrated a bishop nfarrell yet another promoter of martin xe2 x80 x99s homosexual activism arranged for martin to xe2 x80 x9cwelcome xe2 x80 x98gay xe2 x80 x99 families xe2 x80 x9d at the xe2 x80 x9cworld meeting of families xe2 x80 x9d in dublin from which bergoglio has just returned nfinally there is the appointment of the xe2 x80 x9cprogay xe2 x80 x9d robert mcelroy as bishop of san diego concerning which vigan xc3 xb2 reveals xe2 x80 x9cthe appointment of mcelroy in san diego was also orchestrated from above with an encrypted peremptory order to me as nuncio by cardinal parolin xe2 x80 x98reserve the see of san diego for mcelroy xe2 x80 x99 mcelroy was also well aware of mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s abuses as can be seen from a letter sent to him by richard sipe on july 28 2016 xe2 x80 x9d like cupich tobin and farrell mcelroy is an avid promoter of martin xe2 x80 x99s homosexual subversion of the church calling opposition to martin symptomatic of a xe2 x80 x9ccancer of vilification that is seeping into the institutional life of the church xe2 x80 x9d nemboldened by the certainty that he will face no discipline whatsoever martin now backed by xe2 x80 x9ccupich tobin farrell and mcelroy xe2 x80 x9d as vigan xc3 xb2 testifies is urging all the xe2 x80 x9cgay priests xe2 x80 x9d to xe2 x80 x9ccome out xe2 x80 x9d including those ordained since the useless xe2 x80 x9cpedophile summit xe2 x80 x9d presided over by none other than mccarrick as the classic fox in charge of the hen house nbut bergoglio has also lent his own authority to martin xe2 x80 x99s effort to mainstream homosexuality in the church nas vigan xc3 xb2 notes it was bergoglio who made martin a xe2 x80 x9cconsultor of the secretariat for communications xe2 x80 x9d even though he is a xe2 x80 x9cwellknown activist who promotes the lgbt agenda chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in dublin for the world meeting of families xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9cfather xe2 x80 x9d martin now confidently declares sixteen years after the xe2 x80 x9cpedophile summit xe2 x80 x9d that xe2 x80 x9cthe idea of a purge of gay priests is both ridiculous and dangerous nany purge would empty parishes and religious orders of the thousands of priests and bishops who lead healthy lives of service and faithful lives of celibacy xe2 x80 x9d nmartin thus revels in smug certitude that the future of the universal church is in the hands of legions of intrinsically disordered homosexual bishops and priests and their homosexual successors who will perpetuate an existing worldwide homosexual network and that there is absolutely nothing we can or should do about it na worldwide network of corruption beginning at the top nnone of the foregoing is meant to suggest that the homosexual invasion of the catholic hierarchy is confined to american prelates and priests nthe spread of clerical sodomy has not respected national boundaries but rather extends throughout the church under the eyes of a vatican apparatus that is itself thoroughly infested with homosexuals nthis is thanks in large measure to bergoglio who made a flagrantly active homosexual monsignor battista ricca xe2 x80 x9cprelate of the gay lobby xe2 x80 x9d no less than head of his papal household nmoreover it was bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s right hand man cardinal maradiaga who sheltered his friend juan jos xc3 xa9 pineda auxiliary bishop of tegucigalpa from any discipline over his notorious homosexual liaisons with seminarians in that diocese nwhen an apostolic visitation compelled by mounting public pressure confirmed the charges against pineda he was forced to resign even as maradiaga dismissed the incontestable proofs against him as xe2 x80 x9cslander xe2 x80 x9d vigan xc3 xb2 notes that xe2 x80 x9cthe only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted thus making any possible responsibility of his and maradiaga vanish into nowhere xe2 x80 x9d ndespite the fall of his friend pineda maradiaga continues todefend and protect the homosexual corruption of his own seminary involving incontrovertible evidence of rampant sodomy among the seminarians he refuses to dismiss rejecting all the evidence as xe2 x80 x9cgossip xe2 x80 x9d concerning maradiaga who is also mired in financial corruption for which he offers no credible explanation vigan xc3 xb2 provides this withering assessment of the man and his relation to bergoglio nin a team effort with cardinal rodriguez maradiaga mccarrick had become the kingmaker for appointments in the curia and the united states and the most listened to advisor in the vatican for relations with the obama administration nthis is how one explains that as members of the congregation for bishops the pope replaced cardinal burke with wuerl and immediately appointed cupich right after he was made a cardinal nwith these appointments the nunciature in washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops xe2 x80 xa6 by now the faithful have well understood maradiaga xe2 x80 x99s strategy insult the victims to save himself lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power of mismanagement in the administration of church property and of financial disasters even against close friends as in the case of the ambassador of honduras alejandro valladares former dean of the diplomatic corps to the holy see xe2 x80 xa6 nthe pope defends his man cardinal rodriguez maradiaga to the bitter end as he had done in chile with bishop juan de la cruz barros whom he himself had appointed bishop of osorno against the advice of the chilean bishops nfirst he insulted the abuse victims nthen only when he was forced by the media and a revolt by the chilean victims and faithful did he recognize his error and apologize while stating that he had been misinformed causing a disastrous situation for the church in chile but continuing to protect the two chilean cardinals errazuriz and ezzati non the very day archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s testimony was made public sandro magister summed up the entire state of affairs in the church universal after decades of unrestricted homosexual migration into the hierarchy to which bergoglio has contributed mightily xe2 x80 x9cfrom the seminaries to the clergy to the bishops to the cardinals homosexuals are present at all levels by the thousand xe2 x80 x9d narchbishop vigan xc3 xb2 now provides his own decisive summary of the situation based on firsthand experience with a now endemic homosexual corruption of the church njanet smith professor of moral theology at the sacred heart major seminary in detroit recently wrote xe2 x80 x9cthe problem of clergy abuse cannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops and even less so by bureaucratic directives nthe deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated xe2 x80 x9d these homosexual networks which are now widespread in many dioceses seminaries religious orders etc act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations and are strangling the entire church nemphasis added ndefending the council by defending the homosexual status quo nat this moment the entire novus ordo regime of novelty is threatened with collapse on account of its homosexual corruption and voices throughout the catholic world are now echoing archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s call for bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s resignation including laura ingraham xe2 x80 x9ctoo little too late from pope francis in ireland ni stand with archbishop carlo vigano ntime for the laity to demand a new shepherd xe2 x80 x9d even michael voris in a highly amusing example of leading from behind has finally abandoned his absurd refusal to criticize this pontificate and now declares with a screaming headline xe2 x80 x9cpope francis must resign xe2 x80 x9d nnearly three years ago seeing what was certainly coming on the disastrous course bergoglio had already clearly established this newspaper published a petition which states xe2 x80 x9cwe your subjects respectfully petition your holiness to change course for the good of the church and the welfare of souls nfailing this would it not be better for your holiness to renounce the petrine office than to preside over what threatens to be a catastrophic compromise of the church xe2 x80 x99s integrity xe2 x80 x9d our petition was of course dismissed as xe2 x80 x9cridiculous xe2 x80 x9d by the neocatholic commentariat ntoday our ridiculous suggestion is the stuff of mainstream news nfrom the neocatholic perspective the events of recent days present a terrifying prospect the final collapse of the novus ordo establishment an end to the conciliar aggiornamento and a revival of integral tradition which growing numbers of young people are seeking nhence even before archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 had come forward commentators like faggioli were already sounding the neocatholic air raid siren nfaggioli fretted that xe2 x80 x9cthe abuse scandal and delegitimization of the episcopate has created a great power vacuum in the church xe2 x80 x9d that could be filled by the xe2 x80 x9cneotraditionalist catholicism of the younger generations of american catholics xe2 x80 x9d who xe2 x80 x9cattack american bishops and cardinals close to pope francis xe2 x80 x9d accordingly he rushed to the defense of bergoglio and his corrupt regime against xe2 x80 x9ca radicalization of religious conservatism in the neotraditionalism sense xe2 x80 x9d nfor faggioli not only would bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s resignation be unthinkable so also would a purge of the homosexual and prohomosexual prelates bergoglio and his vatican henchmen have systematically enabled nthe pope he argues is not xe2 x80 x9cthe ceo of the catholic church world and the bishops as its managers whom the pope can simply fire xe2 x80 x9d no bergoglio cannot xe2 x80 x9csimply fire xe2 x80 x9d bishops nexcept whenever he pleases as we have seen again and again with the conservative bishops and even cardinals burke and m xc3 xbcller he has sacked because their conservatism offended him or one of his friends prompting even crux to ask xe2 x80 x9cdoes pope francis have an enemies list xe2 x80 x9d then again francis even obtained the removal of his own xe2 x80 x9ctrusted counselor xe2 x80 x9d mccarrick from the college of cardinals albeit only when forced to act due to worldwide condemnation in the media nso according to faggioli the same pope who sacks conservative bishops and cardinals according to his pleasure and has just removed a cardinal from the college of cardinals in an unprecedented disciplinary act under fire from the media is somehow powerless to dismiss modernist bishops who have created an obscene xe2 x80 x9cgay culture xe2 x80 x9d in the church and replace them with orthodox normal heterosexual males nfrancis cannot xe2 x80 x9csimply fire xe2 x80 x9d even cardinal wuerl who covered up crimes of homosexual predation by the priests he transferred elsewhere while archbishop of pittsburgh and who authorized payment of 900000 in hush money to bury sexual abuse claims against a homosexual priest involved in the production of child pornography nwuerl says faggioli xe2 x80 x9cfaces a complex situation on the one hand wuerl was not afraid of clashing with the tribunal over the apostolic signatura in the vatican which wanted to readmit a priest from the pittsburgh diocese to ministry xe2 x80 xa6 while in other cases he seems to have collaborated in covering up some cases xe2 x80 xa6 it is a very difficult position also because wuerl became a symbol xe2 x80 xa6 beyond the specific accusations against him from which he could not publicly defend himself xe2 x80 x9d nin other words because his situation is xe2 x80 x9ccomplex xe2 x80 x9d wuerl unlike mccarrick should remain a cardinal and the archbishop of washington dc thus maintaining a key bulwark against the xe2 x80 x9cneotraditionalist xe2 x80 x9d threat nyet as the pennsylvania grand jury report documents wuerl assisted mccarrick in the coverup of his crimes and now brazenly lies about it nhere too vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s testimony sheds light on the darkness n xe2 x80 xa6 ni myself brought up the subject of mccarrick with cardinal wuerl on several occasions and i certainly didn xe2 x80 x99t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it ni also remember in particular the fact that i had to draw his attention to it because i realized that in an archdiocesan publication on the back cover in color there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with cardinal mccarrick ni immediately phoned cardinal wuerl who expressed his surprise to me telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it nif as he now continues to state he knew nothing of the abuses committed by mccarrick and the measures taken by pope benedict how can his answer be explained nhis recent statements that he knew nothing about it even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims are absolutely laughable nthe cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his chancellor monsignor antonicelli to lie as well ncardinal wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion nfollowing a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of georgetown university i brought it to the attention of its president dr john degioia sending him two subsequent letters nbefore forwarding them to the addressee so as to handle things properly i personally gave a copy of them to the cardinal with an accompanying letter i had written nthe cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it nhowever he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters contrary to what he customarily did ni subsequently learned that the event at georgetown had taken place for seven years nbut the cardinal knew nothing about it ncardinal wuerl well aware of the continuous abuses committed by cardinal mccarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by pope benedict transgressing the pope xe2 x80 x99s order also allowed him to reside at a seminary in washington dc nin doing so he put other seminarians at risk nemphasis in original nwhat really concerns faggioli and those who think like him is not wuerl and his xe2 x80 x9ccomplex situation xe2 x80 x9d which is not complex at all nrather what he views with alarm as an xe2 x80 x9cessential element xe2 x80 x9d of the context in which wuerl operates is that xe2 x80 x9cscandals are also the opportunity for the neotraditionalist catholicism of the younger generations of american catholics to attack american bishops and cardinals close to pope francis xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d better a thousand septuagenarian wuerls in their lavish sties of corruption financed by the faithful than a single young neotraditionalist prelate nbut what exactly is a neotraditionalist nquite simply an orthodox catholic who has had enough of the homosexualinfested regime of novelty imposed on the church by the old men of the council bergoglio merely being the latest the highest placed and one of the last nas faggioli puts it xe2 x80 x9cin the last fifteen years the american catholic church has been traversed by a radicalization of religious conservatism in the neotraditionalism sense especially in the younger generations of priests and intellectuals nthey interpret the current abuse crisis as fruit of the mistakes of the council itself and not only of the postcouncil xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d njust as faggioli fears many in the upandcoming generation of catholic clergy and laity recognize the obvious that the conciliar texts for all their prolix repetition of traditional teaching opened the way to ecclesial disaster nbecause in those texts xe2 x80 x94above all gaudium et spes dignitatis humanae unitatis redintegratio nostra aetate and sacrosanctum concilium xe2 x80 x94the council verbally prostrated itself before xe2 x80 x9cthe modern world xe2 x80 x9d and the practitioners of other religions while authorizing bugnini secretary of the liturgical preparatory commission that drafted what would become sacrosanctum concilium to begin demolition of the sacred liturgy that was the very foundation catholic of orthodoxy and orthopraxis nto quote paul vi then in the depths of his conciliar delirium at the council xe2 x80 x99s close nbut one must realize that this council which exposed itself to human judgment insisted very much more upon this pleasant side of man rather than on his unpleasant one nits attitude was very much and deliberately optimistic na wave of affection and admiration flowed from the council over the modern world of humanity xe2 x80 xa6 ninstead of depressing diagnoses encouraging remedies instead of direful prognostics messages of trust issued from the council to the presentday world nthe modern world xe2 x80 x99s values were not only respected but honored its efforts approved its aspirations purified and blessed nemphasis added nthus did paul describe the conciliar xe2 x80 x9copening to the world xe2 x80 x9d through which the world promptly invaded the church including large numbers of homosexuals who should never have been admitted to the seminary nin sum faggioli is representative of the thinking that requires defense of a homosexualized clergy if only for the reason that traditionminded catholics cannot be allowed to take their place xe2 x80 x9cthis neotraditionalist catholicism believes that sexual abuses are committed only by homosexual clergy xe2 x80 xa6 and that the crisis of abuse can be resolved by a kind of catholic jacobinism that should eliminate all bishops and priests minimally engaged in dialogue with modern culture and replaced by a young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical middle ages and the rejection of a churchworld relationship based on a principle of reality xe2 x80 x9d nrather than xe2 x80 x9cyoung clergy marked by personal sanctity xe2 x80 x9d the neocatholic mentality faggioli exemplifies prefers that homosexual priests and bishops be kept in place in order to continue the xe2 x80 x9cdialogue with modern culture xe2 x80 x9d it is not the integrity of the faith that matters but only perpetuation of the postconciliar regime of novelty nany abandonment of the regime must be viewed as ecclesiastical treason xe2 x80 x94 xe2 x80 x9ccatholic jacobinism xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x94if not criminal activity nfaggioli would probably be more inclined to civil or criminal prosecution of xe2 x80 x9ccatholic jacobins xe2 x80 x9d for xe2 x80 x9chate speech xe2 x80 x9d than novus ordo bishops for their complicity in covering up homosexual rapes n xe2 x80 x9chomosexuality in the clergy exists and is a matter that must be addressed xe2 x80 x9d faggioli fleetingly acknowledges toward the end of his piece xe2 x80 x9cbut the abuse crisis cannot be resolved by making homosexuals within the church the scapegoat of a scandal that has ancient roots well before vatican council ii xe2 x80 x9d and how does the church xe2 x80 x9caddress xe2 x80 x9d a massive infestation by homosexual priests and prelates without removing them from authority and ensuring that they cannot promote homosexual successors for generation after generation nfaggioli has no answer because what he is really arguing xe2 x80 x94the final beachhead of the neocatholic defense of their disintegrating regime xe2 x80 x94is that homosexuals in the hierarchy must remain in authority as an indispensable seawall against a xe2 x80 x9cneotraditionalist xe2 x80 x9d storm surge nfaggioli xe2 x80 x99s argument demonstrates that neocatholicism has never been about making the authentic faith more appealing to a xe2 x80 x9cmodern world xe2 x80 x9d founded precisely on a rejection of the church xe2 x80 x99s authority nit is not about the faith at all nrather it is an ideological movement dedicated to the facesaving defense of a catastrophic failure in ecclesial innovation that has corrupted the human element of the church in practically every department nfor people like faggioli indeed for the traditionhating pope they blindly defend the one thing to be feared is that more and more faithful will recognize the neocatholic polemic for what it is xe2 x80 x94a fraud xe2 x80 x94and begin demanding a return of everything the regime of novelty has stolen from the life of the church nthat is exactly what a growing number of catholics are now doing as even the secular press recognized less than three months before bergoglio began his tyrannical reign nin this respect what the neocatholics are defending at bottom is themselves xe2 x80 x94that is the reputations they have all staked on their defense of the indefensible against the traditionalists they have arrogantly mocked and marginalized for decades only to see to their horror that traditionalism is ever more vindicated as the scandals of the novus ordo mount under this reckless pope to an unsustainable indeed apocalyptic level na return to integral tradition is the threat that faggioli sees as coming particularly from the young nirony of ironies he is now reduced to defending what is old and tired and corrupt against a restoration led largely by a youthful vanguard of what is ever ancient but ever new nfor some it seems no price is too great xe2 x80 x94not even the good of the church xe2 x80 x94to avoid the personal ignominy of being seen on the wrong side of history nconclusion the fatima connection nlong before the arrival of bergoglio in rome the successive vatican secretaries of state angelo sodano and tarcisio bertone were instrumental in advancing the homosexual corruption of the novus ordo establishment nas to bertone and sodano vigan xc3 xb2 provides further vital testimony nnuncio sambi xe2 x80 x99s report on mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s sexual abuse with all the attachments was sent to cardinal tarcisio bertone as secretary of state nmy two abovementioned memos of december 6 2006 and may 25 2008 were also presumably handed over to him by the substitute nas already mentioned the cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals xe2 x80 x94 i cite only the wellknown case of vincenzo de mauro who was appointed archbishopbishop of vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians xe2 x80 x94 and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to pope benedict xe2 x80 xa6 ncardinal angelo sodano was secretary of state until september 2006 all information concerning mccarrick was communicated to him nin november 2000 nunzio montalvo sent him his report passing on to him the aforementioned letter from father boniface ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by mccarrick nit is known that sodano tried to cover up the father maciel scandal to the end nhe even removed the nuncio in mexico city justo mullor who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover maciel and in his place appointed sandri thennuncio to venezuela who was willing to collaborate in the coverup nsodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed that is that pope benedict had decided that the maciel case should be considered closed nbenedict reacted despite sodano xe2 x80 x99s strenuous defense and maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned nit is no coincidence that as i detail in my book on the third secret of fatima sodano and bertone have also taken the leading role in suppressing the integral secret and reducing the message of fatima in general to a generic prescription for personal piety stripped of its prophetic and admonitory content regarding the epochal malfeasance and corruption of the upper hierarchy to which they belong nconcerning my book archbishop pietro sambi vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s predecessor as nuncio in washington whom vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99 credits with diligently reporting mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s crimes to the vatican and conveying benedict xe2 x80 x99s sanctions to mccarrick made some very revealing comments during an interview with robert moynihan published posthumously six years ago in inside the vatican nwe were discussing the third secret of fatima the allegations that the vatican has not published the entire text of the third secret as revealed to sister lucia and the response of cardinal tarcisio bertone the vatican secretary of state in a book where bertone states that there is nothing more to be revealed nsambi said xe2 x80 x9cexcuse me xe2 x80 x9d he got up went out of the room and came back with a book n xe2 x80 x9chere xe2 x80 x9d he said n xe2 x80 x9cdo you know this book nyou should read it xe2 x80 x9d it was christopher ferrara  the secret still hidden n xe2 x80 x9cwait xe2 x80 x9d i said n xe2 x80 x9cyou are the pope xe2 x80 x99s representative in the us and you are urging me to read a book that questions what the secretary of state wrote xe2 x80 x9d sambi replied xe2 x80 x9call i am saying is that there are interesting things worth reading in this book nand in the end we are all after the truth aren xe2 x80 x99t we nthe truth is the important thing xe2 x80 x9d nthe truth is indeed the important thing nand the truth about our situation is revealed in that stillhidden part of the secret to whose contents pope benedict alluded during his pilgrimage to fatima in 2010 identifying elements that do not appear at all in the obscure vision published back in 2000 which sodano and bertone tried to pass of as the entirety of the secret at the same time they were covering up homosexual corruption in high places nas for the new things which we can find in this message today there is also the fact that attacks on the pope and the church come not only from without but the sufferings of the church come precisely from within the church from the sin existing within the church nthis too is something that we have always known but today we are seeing it in a really terrifying way that the greatest persecution of the church comes not from her enemies without but arises from sin within the church and that the church thus has a deep need to relearn penance to accept purification to learn forgiveness on the one hand but also the need for justice nemphasis added ni believe that archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s precious testimony is a sign that heaven itself is now responding to the xe2 x80 x9cneed for justice xe2 x80 x9d in the church nwhether or not justice involves the resignation of the most wayward pope in church history the inevitable season of justice will culminate in the triumph of the immaculate heart of mary and the church xe2 x80 x99s restoration nthis will be a final victory over the enemies within and their apologists such as faggioli who in typical neocatholic style imperiously scoffs at the notion of xe2 x80 x9ca young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical middle ages xe2 x80 x9d and busies himself defending an unsalvageable mass of corruption he dares to describe as xe2 x80 x9ca churchworld relationship based on a principle of reality xe2 x80 x9d ni can only conclude by making my own these closing words of archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 n,"['appeal_to_fear-prejudice', 'appeal_to_authority', 'black-and-white_fallacy', 'repetition',

298,9 steps to successfully counter jihad n npreorder jamie glazov  new book jihadist psychopath how he is charming seducing and devouring us here neditors xe2 x80 x99 note in light of the skyrocketing phenomenon of muslim migrants stabbing unbelievers in random stabbing sprees in europe as well as the calculated denial that leaders authorities and media are enforcing about it frontpage has deemed it important to bring attention to the crucial steps america and the west must take to robustly confront the unceasing onslaught by jihad and its leftist enablers nwe are therefore reprinting below frontpage editor jamie glazov xe2 x80 x99s july 12 2016 breitbart article 9 steps to successfully counter jihad nhaving written the article in the closing chapter of the disastrous obama administration the author recognizes and celebrates the lifesaving turnaround disposition that the trump administration has brought in to counter jihad nfrontpage is most confident that the suggested steps below will continue to be the overall focus of the new administration  which thankfully is now taking many of the crucial and constructive steps vis xc3 xa0vis our enemy nwe find the article more relevant and urgent than ever due to the 17th anniversary of 911 approaching tomorrow n n9 steps to successfully counter jihad nby jamie glazov nwhile the obama administration continues to allow the muslim brotherhood to direct american foreign policy and therefore to implement xe2 x80 x9cstrategies xe2 x80 x9d that render america defenseless in the face of jihad and stealth jihad there are some alternative strategies that have the potential to turn this catastrophic situation around completely in america xe2 x80 x99s favor nbelow are 9 concrete steps that if implemented by a future american administration would make a big difference in preserving our civilization and in defending americans from terrorism n1 nlabel the enemy and make a threat assessment nthe obama administration continues to refuse to label our enemy and therefore it continues to enable our defeat in the terror war nit is urgent that we name our enemy ie nislamic jihad and definitively identify what ideology inspires our enemy ie nislamic law n2 nscrap xe2 x80 x9ccountering violent extremism xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9ccountering violent extremism xe2 x80 x9d is the pathetic and destructive focus of the obama administration in allegedly fighting the terror war non the one hand this xe2 x80 x9cfocus xe2 x80 x9d is vague to the point of being meaningless and completely incapacitates us non the other hand this focus allows the administration to perpetuate the destructive fantasy that there are other types of xe2 x80 x9cextremists xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x94 who just happen to be the left xe2 x80 x99s political opponents xe2 x80 x94 that pose a great threat to the country nfor example as stephen coughlin has revealed the xe2 x80 x9cviolent extremists xe2 x80 x9d the administration is clearly worried about are the xe2 x80 x9crightwing islamophobes xe2 x80 x9d whom the administration obviously considers to be the real threat to american security nthe xe2 x80 x9ccountering violent extremism xe2 x80 x9d is trash and needs to be thrown in the garbage n3 nstop xe2 x80 x9cpartnering xe2 x80 x9d with muslim brotherhood front groups nthe government needs to stop cooperating with and listening to muslim brotherhood front groups such as cair and isna immediately nthe muslim brotherhood document the explanatory memorandum has made it clear that the brotherhood xe2 x80 x99s objective is to destroy our civilization from within by our own hands with the influence of these groups nmoreover as robert spencer advises there needs to be legislation that will bar all such groups and affiliated individuals from advising the government or receiving any grants from it n4 nimplement a concrete xe2 x80 x9ccounteringjihad xe2 x80 x9d strategy nafter discarding the xe2 x80 x9ccountering violent extremism xe2 x80 x9d absurdity a concrete counterjihad strategy must become an official policy nit must specifically register that jihadists are the enemies and that islamic law sharia is what specifically motivates them nmost importantly as sebastian gorka urges in defeating jihad the winnable war the government needs to lay down a vision an actual xe2 x80 x9cthreat doctrine analysis xe2 x80 x9d in a thorough document just like george kennan xe2 x80 x99s long telegram and nsc68 did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the cold war nit is absolutely mindboggling that nothing of this sort exists today in our terror war xe2 x80 x94 and it is a reflection of the left being in charge and of the destructive defeat that it is sowing n5 nlaunch our own counterpropaganda campaign nthe left and islamists engage in propaganda 247 nwhat does our propaganda war entail nzilch nsebastian gorka is crucially correct therefore when he recommends a national counterpropaganda campaign that involves a twopart approach the first being the bolstering of efforts to define our enemy steps 1 and 4 above and second the strengthening of our allies and partners in their own counterpropaganda efforts xe2 x80 x93 which must include our empowering of muslims who are trying to form an antijihadist version of islam nconsequently educational programs have to be set up everywhere from public schools to universities to workplaces in businesses and numerous other institutions nthese programs must crystallize what exactly islamic law is and how it inspires and sanctions violence against unbelievers nthis has to also involve as gorka urges xe2 x80 x9ca nationwide program of education that includes the armed services as well as federal state and local police forces and the intelligence community xe2 x80 x9d nthe education campaign must also focus on the second part of gorka xe2 x80 x99s counterpropaganda campaign which is to help strengthen muslims who seek to seize islam from the jihadists xe2 x80 x99 hands n6 naffirm sharia xe2 x80 x99s assault on the us constitution as seditious nonce the truth is accepted that jihadis are inspired and sanctioned by their islamic texts it must logically become required that mosques islamic schools and groups have to immediately curtail any teaching that motivates sedition violence and hatred of unbelievers ie nremember how cair advised muslims not to talk to the fbi nindeed once the government discerns and labels the elements of islamic law that threaten the american constitution any preaching and spreading of those elements in america must be labelled as seditious n7 nput pressure on mosques islamic groups and schools nauthorities have to start subjecting mosques and other islamic institutions to surveillance xe2 x80 x94 and discard the suicidal leftist notion that it is xe2 x80 x9cracist xe2 x80 x9d and islamophobic to do so nislamic institutions have to be made to buffer their lipservice against terror with actually doing something about it nas robert spencer counsels this has to involve introducing programs that teach against jihadists xe2 x80 x99 understanding of islam xe2 x80 x94 and these programs have to be regularly monitored by the government nthis will be a part of gorka xe2 x80 x99s suggested counterpropaganda campaign discussed in step 5 nspencer rightly stresses that the paradigm has to become that muslim communities have to win the xe2 x80 x9ctrust xe2 x80 x9d of intelligence and law enforcement agents rather than the other way around which is absurdly and tragically the case right now n8 nbring counterjihadists into the government ninstead of having muslim brotherhood sympathizers like mohamed elibiary serving on the us nhomeland security advisory council he xe2 x80 x9cresigned xe2 x80 x9d in sept 2014 under mysterious circumstances and muslim brotherhoodlinked individuals like huma abedin serving as the righthand woman of hillary clinton we need to bring in people who actually love america and want to protect it nwe all know who these noble and courageous individuals are xe2 x80 x93 and some of them are referenced in this article nthe government must also bring in brave muslim individuals who genuinely reject jihad and empower them in propagating their antijihadist vision for islam nps nyes there is an argument to be made that islam cannot be islam without jihad nbut the debate over this belongs in another forum nand whatever the answer it does not mean that the effort to empower muslims who want to make the antijihadist islamic vision possible should not be made n9 nridicule the enemy nridicule is a vicious and potent weapon nthere is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture xe2 x80 x99s sphere of comedy especially in hollywood and our media with regard to the myriad ingredients of sharia and jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches nbill maher for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives xe2 x80 x99 eyes has set a bold standard in this respect in his burka fashion show skit namerican comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in maher xe2 x80 x99s footsteps and americans need to encourage and equip them to do so xe2 x80 x93 and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and islamic forces nwe must never underestimate the crippling effect of comedy on the totalitarian mullahs of the world nindeed the contemptuous snickering and roaring laughter of people as they gaze at the pathetic rules and lives of sharia xe2 x80 x99s gatekeepers poses a danger to tyrants like no other njamie glazov holds a phd in history with a specialty in russian us and canadian foreign policy nhe is the editor of frontpagemagcom the author of the criticallyacclaimed united in hate the left xe2 x80 x99s romance with tyranny and terror and the host of the webtv show the glazov

and others at google were engaged in nonpartisan activities not designed to help any one candidate or another xe2 x80 x94only to undercut her own commentary in later passages in the emails by openly admitting the entire effort to boost latino turnout using google products with official company resources was to elect clinton over trump nthe critical miscalculation murillo wrote in a stunning admission in the email was that latino voters backed trump by higher margins than any experts had forecast in the leadup to the election ntrump xe2 x80 x99s 29 percent among hispanics nationally blew prognosticators away and he hit even higher numbers xe2 x80 x94about 31 percent xe2 x80 x94in the key battleground state of florida murillo admitted nmurillo wrote at the outset of the lengthy message nwe worked very hard nmany people did nwe pushed tp get out the latino vote with our features our partners and our voices nwe kept our google efforts nonpartisan and followed our company xe2 x80 x99s protocols for the elections strategy nwe emphasized our mission to give latinos access to information so that they can make an informed decision at the polls and we feel very grateful for all the

emails were first revealed on fox news on monday evening on tucker carlson tonight by anchor tucker carlson in a special report nbreitbart news also obtained them and has reached out to google with a number of questions about the emails ncarlson in his exclusive report on fox news monday night compared the revelations in the google emails to the probe of russian interference in the us election to special counsel robert mueller xe2 x80 x94raising the question about how much influence tech giants like google and facebook have on election outcomes in the united states ncarlson cited dr robert epstein a social scientist and an expert on google who has said in carlson xe2 x80 x99s words xe2 x80 x9cgoogle alone could determine the outcome of almost any election just by altering its search selections and we would never know it xe2 x80 x9d nepstein has published research detailing how google could influence the results of us elections nbreitbart news has exclusively published several of epstein xe2 x80 x99s reports including a recent one showing that google search manipulation can swing huge swaths of voters nin his report on monday night carlson then described the emails he obtained which breitbart news also obtained ncarlson said nthis wasn xe2 x80 x99t a getoutthevote effort or whatever they say nit wasn xe2 x80 x99t aimed at all potential voters nit wasn xe2 x80 x99t even aimed at a balanced crosssection of subgroups ngoogle didn xe2 x80 x99t try to get out the vote among say christian arabs in michigan or say persian jews in los angeles xe2 x80 x94they sometimes vote republican nit was aimed only at one group a group that google cynically assumed would vote exclusively for the democratic party nfurthermore this mobilization effort targeted not only the entire country but swing states vital to the hillary campaign nthis was not an exercise in civics this was political consulting nit was in effect an inkind contribution to the hillary clinton campaign xe2 x80 x9d ncarlson noted that in communication with google the company xe2 x80 x9cdid not deny that the email was real or that it showed a clear political preference xe2 x80 x9d n xe2 x80 x9ctheir only defense was that the activities they described were either nonpartisan or were not officially taken by the company xe2 x80 x9d carlson said monday night describing google xe2 x80 x99s official response to his requests for comment before challenging the company xe2 x80 x99s response xe2 x80 x9cbut of course they were both nplenty of people in google knew what was going on and we haven xe2 x80 x99t seen any evidence anyone at google disapproved of it and tried to rein it in xe2 x80 x9d nthe email from murillo continues by explaining just how expansive the efforts the company undertook to achieve its objective were nwe had our partners help spread the word about our features on social media including youtubers and influencers like dulce candy jorge narvaez jessie y joy barbara bermudo and pamela silva of univision jackie cruz aka la flaca from orange is the new black and more nwe promoted our partner the latino community foundation xe2 x80 x99s nonpartisan yovoyavotarytu i xe2 x80 x99m going to vote are you ncampaign and leveraged our social media influencer friends xe2 x80 x99 reach to hit over 11m impressions with that hashtag nwe hosted an event with over 200 people and a hangout with social media influencers about the power of the latino vote and the new research nielsen published about the latino electorate nthis reached 44m social media impressions and signaled to many that google and our partners value the latino community and our role in this election nwe brought the same research to the latism conference where people were beyond thrilled to see google xe2 x80 x99s support and acknowledgment of the latino community nif murillo had ended her email there this probably would not amount to the level of a national news story nbut she did not she went on for another several paragraphs on the first page and an extra three pages to admit the openly partisan intent of google xe2 x80 x99s actions including a remarkable inwriting confirmation that at least one of google xe2 x80 x99s actions amounted to a xe2 x80 x9csilent donation xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x94something that could raise federal election commission fec red flags if authorities decide to launch an official investigation into this matter now that these emails have been publicly revealed nit is in the next paragraph that murillo openly admits that google made a xe2 x80 x9csilent donation xe2 x80 x9d in her words paying for rides to polls via leftist organization voto latino nmurillo wrote in the next paragraph nwe also supported partners like voto latino to pay for rides to the polls in key states silent donation nwe even helped them create ad campaigns to promote the rides with support from hola folks who rallied and volunteered their time to help nwe supported voto latino to help them land an interview with senator meza of arizona key state for us to talk about the election and how to use google search to find information about how to vote nthey were a strong partner among many in this effort nthe next paragraph is where murillo begins to make her next major admission that the effort was not just to increase voter turnout generally but to elect hillary clinton over donald trump n xe2 x80 x9cultimately after all was said and done the latino community did come out to vote and completely surprised us xe2 x80 x9d murillo wrote n xe2 x80 x9cwe never anticipated that 29 of latinos would vote for trump nno one did nwe saw headlines like this about early voter turn out and thought that this was finally the year that the xe2 x80 x98sleeping giant xe2 x80 x99 had awoken xe2 x80 x9d non the next page the email continues with a headline from an article in the atlantic by james fallows xe2 x80 x9c2016 the year latinos saved america xe2 x80 x9d nunder that was a tweet from jon ralston of ralston reports in nevada saying among other things that xe2 x80 x9ctrump is dead xe2 x80 x9d because of latino turnout in early voting in the state ntrump did not end up winning nevada in the end but he did beat clinton in 30 and a half other states n xe2 x80 xa6 nat that point after the ralston tweet murillo openly admits the partisan motives of google xe2 x80 x99s electioneering efforts n xe2 x80 x9con personal note we really thought we had shown up to demonstrate our political power against a candidate who had vehemently offended our community by calling us rapists and drug dealers xe2 x80 x9d murillo wrote n xe2 x80 x9cwe read the headline and thought wow we did it xe2 x80 x9d nmurillo xe2 x80 x99s email continues by including another headline this time from the new yorker xe2 x80 x99s benjamin wallacewells xe2 x80 x9clatino voters show trump what it means to be american xe2 x80 x9d that piece was written on nov 7 2016 the day before the election nthen she begins writing again xe2 x80 x9cbut then reality set in nonly 71 of latinos voted for hillary and that wasn xe2 x80 x99t enough xe2 x80 x9d nthe third page of the email begins with another headline and image of a latina woman in a red make america great again hat and xe2 x80 x9clatinos for trump xe2 x80 x9d sign nthe story from ruben navarette jr published in the daily beast is headlined xe2 x80 x9cwhy the latino vote didn xe2 x80 x99t save america xe2 x80 x9d the subheadline xe2 x80 x9chispanic voters were supposed to be one of clinton xe2 x80 x99s blue firewalls xe2 x80 x94but one in three ended up splitting for trump xe2 x80 x9d is also included in murillo xe2 x80 x99s google email nfrom there murillo continues writing for another page and a half nthe voters we wanted to reach did end up having an influence in the end most notably in florida nlatino voters voted for trump more in florida than in other states 31 and fl was critical by popular vote and the electoral college nwe xe2 x80 x99ll keep an eye on any other results that can show us the influence that our efforts had on the election nwe know we gave this our best and are now figuring out what comes next nthanks again for all your help and support in this effort nin the next paragraph murillo again openly admits she was not xe2 x80 x9cobjective xe2 x80 x9d when it came to the election n xe2 x80 x9ci have tried to stay objective but i ask that you please give us some time to pause and reflect xe2 x80 x9d murillo wrote n xe2 x80 x9cthis is devastating for our democratic latino community nafter all these efforts and what we thought was positive momentum toward change the results are not what we expected at all nwe are afraid for our families and especially for the millions of immigrants who now don xe2 x80 x99t know what the future holds for them xe2 x80 x9d nafter that murillo says she cannot communicate with key organizers of the effort by google and its partners xe2 x80 x94a project known as hola xe2 x80 x94because she is afraid of secret protrump spies on the listservs created nshe also admits ongoing discussions among these people about meeting to give grieving hillary clinton supporters hugs after trump crushed her on election day nshe also says those involved in google xe2 x80 x99s getoutthevote efforts were openly seeking consolation after clinton lost and that she and another person cried after trump won xe2 x80 x93 for the first time they have cried due to an election result nmurillo wrote nwhat xe2 x80 x99s most difficult for us is we can xe2 x80 x99t even email the hola list to reach our community and discuss what this means for us because we know that apparently some may actually be trump supporters nthere is a thread right now among the core hola group where people are sharing how much they hurt how much they need support right now and that they are coordinating in different offices to meet up to just hold each other none in a remote office said xe2 x80 x98if you guys do any sort of meetings i xe2 x80 x99d love to join virtually ni think i xe2 x80 x99m currently the only latinx in my office nit xe2 x80 x99s kinda hard xe2 x80 x99 understatement nanother said xe2 x80 x98i xe2 x80 x99ve never cried after an election until last night xe2 x80 x99 same here nshe was not done there nin the next paragraph murillo wrote that this election result hurt her badly nshe also admits the election result was a xe2 x80 x9closs xe2 x80 x9d another indication that google xe2 x80 x99s efforts were clearly attempting to use company resources to elect democrat clinton over republican trump and influence the results of the election nshe also says that the company xe2 x80 x94and herself in particular xe2 x80 x94will redouble efforts in the future to get a different and more desired result in future elections n xe2 x80 x9ci xe2 x80 x99m in shock and it hurts more than i could have ever imagined but trying to stay optimistic and keep my head high xe2 x80 x9d murillo wrote n xe2 x80 x9closs is a part of life and i do think frustrations challenge us to work smarter and get creative nmy partners have sent notes and are saying the same thing xe2 x80 x94 time to keep working harder xe2 x80 x9d nat the top of the fourth page of the email murillo asks her colleagues at google to give out a xe2 x80 x9csmile xe2 x80 x9d to grieving leftist latinos who work at the company n xe2 x80 x9cif you see a latino googler in the office california ew york please give them a smile xe2 x80 x9d murillo wrote n xe2 x80 x9cthey are probably hurting right now nit xe2 x80 x99s tough to handle now that we know not all of us were against this so we may be even more divided than ever nat least in ca y though you can rest assured that the latinos of these blue states need your thoughts and prayers at least for them and their families xe2 x80 x9d nthen she continues by stating she is going on a planned vacation she thought she was taking to xe2 x80 x9ccelebrate xe2 x80 x9d a clinton win but after trump won she says her vacation xe2 x80 x9cwill be time to reflect on how to continue to support my community through these difficult times xe2 x80 x9d nmurillo in the next line reveals that she thought she was sharing her viewpoints on these matters in a tight circle that would not leak n xe2 x80 x9ci xe2 x80 x99m not sharing my personal opinions very broadly but wanted to share openly here in the circle of trust xe2 x80 x9d she wrote nthis email leaked to fox news and breitbart news and is now likely to become a centerpiece in the case that google is throwing its weight around to interfere in elections in the united states in a partisan manner against the duly elected president of the united states nthis email from murillo was not just from some rogue staffer inside google nher original email was forwarded on to other google executives by the aforementioned gevelber according to another email obtained

x80 x989 steps to successfully counter jihad xe2 x80 x99 glazov believed that the article was more relevant and urgent than ever due to the skyrocketing jihadist stabbings in europe xe2 x80 x94 and to the 17th anniversary of 911 that was approaching the next day nthe report said it appears xe2 x80 x9cthat daring to give suggestions on how our civilization can stop jihadist attacks and another 911

on behalf of muslim women and girls in his efforts to protect them from fgm honor killings and other shariah barbarities has gained him the anger and hatred of facebook xe2 x80 x99s guardians xe2 x80

304,facebook lifts frontpage editor jamie glazov xe2 x80 x99s 911 ban n neditors  note to best understand why facebook would ban jamie glazov on 911 in the first place preorder jamie  new book jihadist psychopath how he is charming seducing and devouring us here nthe book illustrates how the jihadist psychopath has with the help of the left successfully built his totalitarian plantation in the west  on which the political and cultural establishment is now enslaved and dutifully following his orders njamie outlines the frameworks of this tyrannical plantation and how those who are trapped on it and yearn for freedom can best escape nfrontpage editors are happy to announce our free speech victory facebook has lifted frontpage editor jamie glazov  30day ban on facebook apologizing and saying that the block was a xe2 x80 x9cmistake xe2 x80 x9d nwe have no doubt of course that no xe2 x80 x9cmistake xe2 x80 x9d had actually occurred in this matter and that the ban has only been lifted because of the publicity that we engaged in  and received nwhile it is a positive development that facebook has lifted the ban on jamie for now this story is crucial to amplify now more than ever seeing that facebook and all of leftistrun social media is at this moment clearly accelerating its totalitarian attack on the free speech of conservatives nsee jamie  video on this whole surreal affair here na brief recap of jamie  story on sept 11 the 17th anniversary of the 911 terror strike facebook  unholy alliance masters informed jamie that he was suspended from facebook for 30 days due to his posting of his article 9 steps to successfully counter jihad which facebook informed him violated their community standards nthis suggested of course that giving advice on how to prevent another 911 and all other jihadist attacks against america is now against facebook xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x98community standards xe2 x80 x99 nread the whole story here nfrontpage and jamie immediately publicized this tyrannical behavior of facebook nthen yesterday on sept 13 facebook notified jamie that it had made a mistake and that it was lifting his block nit goes without saying that this retraction and surrender by facebook occurred only because of the wide publicity that jamie  banning had received nand we are immensely grateful for all the massive support that was given to us across the internet including especially from breitbart pjmedia worldnetdaily and thomas lifson at american thinker nleading brave conservative figures such as michelle malkin and laura loomer also stood up for jamie tweeting about his ban  and to them we send our heartfelt appreciation njamie is of course no stranger to social media censorship  especially of the insane variety nthe counter jihad coalition  cjc facebook page which jamie helped run with cjc president steve amundson was removed a few years ago with absolutely no explanation nthe cjc is a human rights and pronational security group that is dedicated to protecting america and the west from jihad  and muslim and nonmuslim people from sharia oppression nthe question remains why would facebook remove such a page let alone in such a fascistic manner  and never explain why nin april earlier this year jamie was suspended from facebook for posting screenshots of a muslim  threat to him on the platform nthen in may his twitter account was temporarily suspended and he was forced to delete tweets he posted which directly quoted islamic religious texts nhis account was suspended for violating twitter xe2 x80 x99s rules relating to xe2 x80 x9chateful conduct xe2 x80 x9d it is hateful conduct apparently to reference what islamic texts themselves say nindeed frontpage  editor had simply referred to sahih bukhari xe2 x80 x99s texts discussing mohammed xe2 x80 x99s marriage to aisha when she was six years old 76288 and to qur anic suras that mandate the hijab for women 2431 3359 and sanction sexual slavery 43 3350 none thing we know for sure is that despite this lifting of jamie xe2 x80 x99s ban facebook and the leftist totalitarians in other social media venues and in the culture at large will continue their unrelenting effort to suffocate dissent and conservative voices non facebook many brave conservative truthtellers continue to be censored in myriad ways these individuals include anni cyrus bosch fawstin mark lutchman and of course diamond  silk nthe case of walkaway leader brandon straka is especially disturbing he was recently banned by facebook for the crime of announcing that he would be interviewed by alex jones nprager u has had its videos mysteriously disappear off of facebook and then only after vociferous protest reappear nfacebook is of course just one terrain of this leftist brownshirtstyle assault on free speech neveryone knows by now for instance what has happened in the most orwellian sense to alex jones and infowars on facebook youtube and twitter nleading scholar of islam and jihadwatchorg director robert spencer meanwhile is not just a target at facebook where his referrals are down 90 from what they once were he has been banned by patreon at the behest of mastercard  and mastercard has yet to respond to his lawyer xe2 x80 x99s letter ngofundme has also banned spencer because of a smear by the southern poverty law center splc hate machine nspeaking of mastercard the david horowitz freedom center just recently won a major battle with the credit card defeating wellfinanced leftwing groups that are trying to run the center out of business and suffocate free speech in america nthe freedom center emerged victorious but it is clear that leftist hate groups such as the splc and color of changeorg are preparing new attacks against the freedom center and other conservative groups and individuals 247 nto be sure the left  attacks on the david horowitz freedom center continue unabated just recently a hit piece in the washington post smeared a standup noble gentleman like florida gubernatorial candidate republican ron desantis libeling david horowitz in the process nthe article stated falsely and maliciously that horowitz  restoration weekend that desantis had attended was somehow xe2 x80 x9ca racially charged event xe2 x80 x9d  a vicious lie that frontpage has exposed and for which the washington post is still to apologize and issue a retraction nto learn why david horowitz is one of the central targets of the left make sure to watch this video nthus we clearly gauge that there is no disgusting and venomous level to which the left will not stoop in its destructive agenda nyes frontpage editor jamie glazov has had his ban lifted at facebook but this is clearly only a brief reprieve for him on that platform  and it is only obviously a very tiny space in the stalinist left  war on america and on everything on which it stands nat this dire moment we all need to amplify our voices in defense of free speech nand we need to adamantly defend all the truthtellers at the very moment they come under attack nwe also need to contact our representatives and to call for a congressional investigation into this pernicious assault by the fascist left on our liberties nthe battle for america  and for the west  is on neditors  postscript please make sure to follow jamie glazov on facebook as well as on twitter jamieglazov to strengthen his social media strength in the face of the left  vicious war on free speech nthank you n,"['appeal_to_fear-prejudice', 'repetition', 'loaded_language', 'doubt',

306,the lastminute character assassination of judge kavanaugh n nusing any despicable tactic at hand to derail judge brett kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s supreme court confirmation less than a week before the senate judiciary committee is scheduled to vote on whether to approve his nomination senate democrats have sunk to their lowest level of character assassination yet nthey have resorted to peddling an allegation of sexual misconduct against judge kavanaugh that supposedly occurred while the judge was in high school nthe accuser had refused to identify herself before and during the senate judiciary committee hearings nshe conveniently waited until this sunday to come forward via an ontherecord interview with the washington post nthe accuser xe2 x80 x99s name is christine blasey ford a registered democrat who is currently a california professor teaching clinical psychology njudge kavanaugh issued a statement on friday in which he said i categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation ni did not do this back in high school or at any time nsenator dianne feinstein dcalif the ranking democrat on the senate judiciary committee that heard judge kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s public testimony earlier this month during his supreme court confirmation hearing had received last july a copy of a letter written by the woman making the charge who we now know was ms ford neven though senator feinstein had the letter in hand she never brought up the charge during the public hearing nor during her own meeting with the judge ninstead senator feinstein sat on the letter until late last week when she issued a cryptic release stating that she had received the letter but did not want to give more details in deference to the woman xe2 x80 x99s wish to keep the matter confidential nsenator feinstein turned the letter over to the fbi nthe fbi placed the letter in its background file on judge kavanaugh but decided not to pursue any further investigation nsenator feinstein had initially resisted sharing the contents of the letter with her fellow democrat members of the senate judiciary committee or to go public with its existence because xe2 x80 x9cthe incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion xe2 x80 x9d and she had already xe2 x80 x9ctaken care of it xe2 x80 x9d according to a source quoted by the new yorker nnevertheless senator feinstein evidently bowed to pressure from her leftist colleagues to find a way to insert the allegation into the cesspool of public gossip at the eleventh hour nthe new yorker article written before ms ford publicly identified herself provided some details regarding her allegation nhowever now ms ford has decided to do what she called her xe2 x80 x9ccivic responsibility xe2 x80 x9d and tell her own story publicly nhow convenient coming just 4 days before the scheduled senate judiciary committee vote nthe whole sequence of events surrounding how this allegation has suddenly come to light reeks of a setup reminiscent of how anita hill surfaced in a lastminute attempt to derail justice clarence thomas  supreme court confirmation nchristine blasey ford claims according to the washington post article that xe2 x80 x9cone summer in the early 1980s kavanaugh and a friend xe2 x80 x94 both xe2 x80 x98stumbling drunk xe2 x80 x99 ford alleges xe2 x80 x94 corralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in montgomery county nwhile his friend watched she said kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her onepiece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it nwhen she tried to scream she said he put his hand over her mouth n xe2 x80 x98i thought he might inadvertently kill me xe2 x80 x99 said ford n xe2 x80 x98he was trying to attack me and remove my clothing xe2 x80 x99 xe2 x80 x9d ms ford said she was able to escape the room and go home without any apparent further incident after xe2 x80 x9ckavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s friend and classmate at georgetown preparatory school mark judge jumped on top of them sending all three tumbling xe2 x80 x9d nhere is where ms ford xe2 x80 x99s story becomes quite murky and begins to fall apart nalthough ms ford believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982 she xe2 x80 x9csaid she does not remember some key details of the incident xe2 x80 x9d according to the washington post article nfor example ms ford xe2 x80 x9csaid she does not remember how the gathering came together the night of the incident xe2 x80 x9d she also does not remember how she got home nyet she claims to be absolutely certain that kavanaugh whom she presumably knew only as an acquaintance and said she had not spoken to since the night the incident allegedly occurred was involved in the alleged incident nms ford admitted that she xe2 x80 x9ctold no one at the time what had happened to her xe2 x80 x9d in fact she said she recalled thinking xe2 x80 x9ci xe2 x80 x99m not ever telling anyone this nthis is nothing it didn xe2 x80 x99t happen and he didn xe2 x80 x99t rape me xe2 x80 x9d even if one explains this behavior as the natural reaction of a frightened teenager to a highly traumatic incident that does not explain why by her own admission she xe2 x80 x9ctold no one of the incident in any detail until 2012 when she was in couples therapy with her husband xe2 x80 x9d according to the washington post article nmost revealingly the article reported on a gaping hole in the therapist xe2 x80 x99s notes portions of which were provided by ms ford for the washington post xe2 x80 x99s review nthe therapist xe2 x80 x99s notes xe2 x80 x9cdo not mention kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students xe2 x80 x98from an elitist boys xe2 x80 x99 school xe2 x80 x99 who went on to become xe2 x80 x98highly respected and highranking members of society in washington xe2 x80 x99 xe2 x80 x9d nin other words the only written documentation ms ford has offered in support of her allegation about the incident she said took place while she was in high school xe2 x80 x93 a therapist xe2 x80 x99s notes of a couples therapy session occurring 30 years after the alleged incident xe2 x80 x93 did not mention judge kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s name njudge kavanaugh has had extensive background checks performed on him in the past for his various federal government positions including for his current position as a federal appellate court judge without the accusation ever having surfaced nms ford may believe her story to be true but the lack of any credible corroborating evidence her partial memory of details surrounding the alleged incident and the absence of any pattern of such sexual misconduct by judge kavanaugh undercut the reliability of her version of the incident nin a letter addressed to senate judiciary committee chairman charles grassley riowa and senator feinstein 65

minimum these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated xe2 x80 x9d senator schumer said nif a thorough investigation was considered to be so important why didn t senator feinstein

x9cmerely xe2 x80 x9d a judge on the dc ncircuit court of appeals nsince kavanaugh has denied the story however the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot nat the very least if the attack happened he should be disqualified for lying nyet unless all parties start telling the same story there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred nwe don xe2 x80 x99t need certainty however to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the supreme court ni have the same standard for brett kavanaugh as i did for roy moore for donald trump for bill clinton xe2 x80 x94 or for any other politician who xe2 x80 x99s accused of misconduct nis it more likely than not that the allegation is true ngiven the totality of the evidence i believe it is more likely than not that bill clinton committed rape and sexual harassment ni believe it is more likely than not that donald trump has committed sexual assault ni believe it is more likely than not that roy moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls nbut the evidence against kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men nso far at least it falls far short of the evidence against virtually any other politician or celebrity who has faced consequences during this metoo moment nhere xe2 x80 x99s why nfirst one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration ndid the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred nwith clinton trump moore and many other politicians and celebrities there was ample contemporaneous corroboration nhere there was not naccording to the washington post xe2 x80 x9cford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012 when she was in couples therapy with her husband xe2 x80 x9d nthat xe2 x80 x99s almost three decades of silence xe2 x80 x94 three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change nbut even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem nthey actually contradict her story on a key detail naccording to the post xe2 x80 x9cthe notes say four boys were involved a discrepancy that ford says was an error on the therapist xe2 x80 x99s part nford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room xe2 x80 x9d nor do the notes mention kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s name even though her husband says ford named kavanaugh in the sessions nthose are important discrepancies and if six years ago she told the therapist four men and says two men now that suggests that her memory of the event may be suspect nas a former trial lawyer i can tell you that while neither notes nor memories are infallible in a contest between contemporaneous notes and later verbal testimony about those notes the content of the written notes usually prevails njuries are extremely skeptical of witnesses who contradict written notes xe2 x80 x94 after all the notes are taken when the words are immediate and there isn xe2 x80 x99t the overwhelming pressure of a trial to conform your testimony to the desired outcome nat least the investigation seems somewhat manageable nif there were only four boys there who were the other two nlet xe2 x80 x99s hear from them nin fact investigators should interview everyone else at the party nyet given all the years that have passed would it be possible to find anyone who remembers being at that party nwould they remember any details at all nif someone saw kavanaugh stumbling drunk at the party that would obviously bolster ford xe2 x80 x99s account nif another attendee says xe2 x80 x9che was totally sober and with me the whole time xe2 x80 x9d that helps kavanaugh nbut the odds of getting details that precise are long indeed and there is always a chance that a motivated classmate might lie xe2 x80 x94 for either person xe2 x80 xa6 n,"['appeal_to_authority', 'black-and-white_fallacy', 'loaded_language',

archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s damning indictment of bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s rehabilitation of the monster once known as cardinal mccarrick for some five years before adverse worldwide press coverage forced to him to punish that serial homosexual rapist of whose crimes vigan xc3 xb2 had personally informed him back in 2013 xe2 x80 x94information of which bergoglio was clearly already aware at that time as vigan xc3 xb2 testifies ni never thought i xe2 x80 x99d see the day when a preening internetcreated neocatholic doyenne such as simcha fisher as notorious as mark shea for her crude and often unprintable invective against traditionalists would unload on pope bergoglio with the following headline xe2 x80 x9cdoes francis know he sounds like an abuser xe2 x80 x9d nthe scales have fallen from fisher xe2 x80 x99s eyes and now at last she sees bergoglio however grudgingly for what he is a powermad ecclesiastical tyrant na tyrant moreover who has ascended to the papacy in a manner reminiscent of the ascension of the corrupt benedict ix another xe2 x80 x9cdisgrace to the chair of peter xe2 x80 x9d following the machinations of a roman cabal as i discuss below nquoth fisher ni have a number of friends who have escaped abusive marriages nthey tell me that pope francis is sounding more and more like the men who abused them nhe xe2 x80 x99s sounding like the men who hid that abuse from the world who taught their victims to blame themselves who used spiritual pressure to persuade them and their families that it would actually be wrong sinful to defend themselves njust listen to him nafter responding to a question about vigano xe2 x80 x99s very serious accusations he said point blank xe2 x80 x9ci will not say a single word on this xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 xa6 for the rest of the week and more he kept up an unmistakable theme of calling for silence equating silence with holiness and painting himself as a christlike victim in his silence nthen he says it xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9cugly xe2 x80 x9d to accuse others of sinning nthen he suggests that healing and reconciliation will only come if we take a hard look at our own flaws xe2 x80 xa6 nto the victims of the church and to those who love them it sounds like he is saying xe2 x80 x9cwho do you think you are ni don xe2 x80 x99t have to explain myself to you nyou xe2 x80 x99re the guilty one nyou brought this on yourself nif you want to be loved then know your place ni xe2 x80 x99m the victim here not you nif you know what xe2 x80 x99s good for you keep your mouth shut xe2 x80 x9d this is how abusers talk nthey xe2 x80 x99re not content with power they have to keep their victims doubting and blaming themselves constantly so they don xe2 x80 x99t become a threat nwhether francis knows it or not this is how he sounds nwe can overlook the fig leaf xe2 x80 x9cwhether francis knows it or not xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d nfisher knows that francis knows it even if she still cannot bring herself to say explicitly what should now be apparent to the entire body of the faithful that bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s very presence on the chair of peter is a grave threat to the common good of the church and the integrity of the faith nclick below to subscribe to the remnant youtube channel nyet fisher maintains a sliver of space for deniability in order to maintain that indispensable distinction between her and those loathsome traditionalists xe2 x80 x9ci don xe2 x80 x99t have any ideological reason to want to bring him down ni have defended him as long as i could up until the chile debacle nand so i am working as hard as i can not to assume the worst not to believe that this man who promised so much fresh air is really so intent on slamming doors shut before we find out even worse things hidden inside nbut he is not making it easy ni am not saying he is an abuser nbut he sounds like one xe2 x80 x9d nthat is fisher was not concerned about bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s relentless assault on traditional catholic teaching and practice xe2 x80 x94to her opposition to francis on that account is just xe2 x80 x9cideology xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x94but only his role in covering up sexual abuse by bishops and priests nbut why is fisher still xe2 x80 x9cworking hard not to assume the worst xe2 x80 x9d when there is no longer anything to assume as the evermounting evidence of malintent has been in plain view for years nindeed why else did archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 risk everything in order to expose this pope even to the extent of revealing matters supposedly within the scope of xe2 x80 x9cthe pontifical secret xe2 x80 x9d non orders of the vatican secretary of state the vatican secret police are reportedly scouring the globe in search of vigan xc3 xb2 who has gone into hiding xe2 x80 x9cin order to prevent more unpredictable damage to the image of pope francis and the holy see on the world stage but also to xe2 x80 x98prepare the terrain xe2 x80 x99 for the former apostolic nuncioturnedwhistleblower to be prosecuted xe2 x80 x9d under canon law nthe dictator pope must destroy his most potent critic thus far neverything depends on it nbut it may already be too late to save a regime whose only defense is not truth but raw power nat last count some 29 bishops have publicly declared vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s allegations against bergoglio credible and worthy of investigation nnow even the distinguished canonist edward peters who is no less than a referendary of the apostolic signatura appointed by pope benedict xvi declares that if vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s allegations are true then bergoglio must go nof what was said above concerning resignation from church office in general what would not apply to a pope of all office holders if he as alleged by vigan xc3 xb2 from the first months of his papacy knowingly protected and favored a cardinal who was pick a disgusting verbing seminarians nby what possible stretch of the imagination would such an occupant be suited for the chair of peter ndoes the historical fact that some pretty bad popes held on to office despite committing various offenses justify other popes acting badly in shirking even the minimal gesture of resigning nvigan xc3 xb2 is unquestionably in a position to know and claims to know whether his central allegation that francis xe2 x80 x99 was covering for mccarrick big time for years is correct nbelieving as he does that his claims are correct vigan xc3 xb2 in calling for francis xe2 x80 x99 resignation has done nothing more or less than exercise his right under canon law xe2 x80 x9cto manifest to the sacred pastors his opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the church and to make his opinion known to the rest of the christian faithful xe2 x80 xa6 xe2 x80 x9d 1983 cic 212 xc2 xa7 3 ni have not called for francis xe2 x80 x99 resignation because i do not know with the degree of certitude that a lawyer seeks whether vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s key allegations against francis are substantially true most assuredly however if i reach the conclusion that they are true i would say without hesitation that francis should resign nbergoglio will not of course resign nhe will cling to power with his last breath in order to carry out the many other acts of ecclesial subversion he clearly has in mind nthe only remedies for the plague of bergoglio are his natural death or deposition nyes deposition ncanon212 has linked to an interesting and timely piece on the role of the synod of sutri near rome in 1046 which dealt with the problem of three rival claimants to the papacy each installed by a roman faction first the execrable benedict ix mentioned above nsecond the interloper sylvester iii installed in the chair of peter after benedict had been driven from rome nthird the wellintentioned but dimwitted gregory vi whose election was tainted by a seemingly simoniacal negotiation with benedict who had returned to rome in 1045 and ousted sylvester according to which benedict would receive a generous pension if he resigned the papacy which benedict did only to rescind his resignation nthe synod was convoked by henry iii the german king and soontobecrowned holy roman emperor a pious and austere christian and an exponent of the cluniac spirit of reform nthe synod declared that benedict ix who had refused to appear was deposed notwithstanding his attempt to undo his resignation nas for sylvester the synod declared that he be xe2 x80 x9cstripped of his sacerdotal rank and shut up in a monastery xe2 x80 x9d gregory was also declared deposed either by the act of the synod itself or by gregory xe2 x80 x99s own voluntary resignation in view of the synod nat henry iii xe2 x80 x99s designation the german bishop of bamberg became clement ii but he died after only a year whereupon benedict reasserted his claim to the papacy for the third time in 1047 only to be driven from rome again by imperial troops in 1048 ndamasus ii another german bishop designated by henry reigned for a mere three weeks before dying whereupon pope st leo ix succeeded to the papacy reigning until 1054 nleo as john rao observes was the first in a line of popes who xe2 x80 x9ctook charge of the movement of innovative christian restoration xe2 x80 x9d which included a breaking of the dominance of roman nobility over papal elections nrao black legends 147148 nas the cited article on the synod of sutri notes although the scurrilous benedict ix objected to his deposition by the synod xe2 x80 x9cthe church has always accepted his deposition as valid nthe king of germany then appointed clement ii as pope who promptly crowned the king holy roman emperor nbenedict ix after the death of clement claimed the papacy again nthe church to this day recognizes clement ii as a true pope xe2 x80 x9d nmoreover benedict ix himself is recognized as a true pope xe2 x80 x94a valid but deposed pope xe2 x80 x94during three separate periods listed as three distinct pontificates in the canon of popes nthis was possible owing to the lack of any set canonical form for papal elections a pope could gain or regain the office by various machinations nindeed even the vatican xe2 x80 x99s own website states that benedict was pope from 10471048 the very year of his third ascension to the office from which he was finally driven by force nonly with the ascension of pope nicholas ii in 1059 was it established that henceforth the cardinalbishops would elect the pope with the other cardinals having the right to confirm or veto the nominee nby 1100 what we now know as the college of cardinals embracing all the cardinals of different titles had the exclusive right to elect a pope and the members of the college xe2 x80 x9chave held it ever since xe2 x80 x9d eric john the popes 181 nthese lessons of history should suffice to dispel the pious fable never a teaching of the magisterium that every pope is chosen by the holy ghost to lead the church nthis theological error which bergoglio has exploited to the hilt is a key element in the related error of papalotry which elevates the person of the pope above the office he occupies and makes of him the leader of a personality cult everyone is commanded to xe2 x80 x9clove xe2 x80 x9d in the superficially emotional sense and obey no matter what he says or does rather than a custodian and defender of the deposit of faith whose lovability personality and opinions are utterly irrelevant to the exercise and scope of his office nas pope benedict has observed when it comes to the election of a pope xe2 x80 x9cthe spirit xe2 x80 x99s role should be understood in a much more elastic sense not that he sic dictates the candidate for whom one must vote xe2 x80 xa6 nthere are too many contrary instances of popes the holy spirit obviously would not have picked xe2 x80 x9d bergoglio is undeniably one of them nso what can be done to defend the church against bergoglio nthat the mode of papal election by cardinals has persisted for nearly a thousand years has led to the general impression that it pertains to the irreformable divine constitution of the church but it certainly does not nas to matters of purely ecclesiastical law such as this one the church has always allowed for departures from traditional practice in cases of emergency or grave necessity nand just as a synod was employed to address three rival claimants to the papal throne in 1046 declaring at least two of them deposed so today might it be possible for reformminded cardinals and bishops comprising an imperfect council to undo the incalculable damage caused by the cabal that lobbied for bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s election before the last conclave xe2 x80 x94a cabal that included none other than mccarrick whom bergoglio rewarded by rehabilitating that monster despite the massive evidence of his unspeakable crimes nwhat would be the grounds for a declaration of deposition at such a gathering of prelates none could readily point to the evidence that a faction that included bergoglio himself had agreed upon his election before the conclave and that all those involved including bergoglio were thereby excommunicated latae sententiae in accordance with article 81 of john paul ii xe2 x80 x99s universi dominici gregis which provides nthe cardinal electors shall further abstain from any form of pact agreement promise or other commitment of any kind which could oblige them to give or deny their vote to a person or persons nif this were in fact done even under oath i decree that such a commitment shall be null and void and that no one shall be bound to observe it and i hereby impose the penalty of excommunication latae sententiae upon those who violate this prohibition nto quote cajetan on this point citations taken from the linked article by robert siscoe deposition by an imperfect council is appropriate xe2 x80 x9cwhen one or more popes suffer uncertainty with regard to their election as seems to have arisen in the schism of urban vi and others nthen lest the church be perplexed those members of the church who are available have the power to judge which is the true pope if it can be known and if it cannot be known it has the power to provide that the electors agree on one or another of them xe2 x80 x9d ni am not saying that such a case has been proven nrather what i am saying is that this hypothetical imperfect council could determine that it has been proven and act accordingly and that the church would judge any resulting deposition of bergoglio in the same manner it judges the deposition of benedict ix nanother ground for deposition xe2 x80 x94as determined by the imperfect council not any of us xe2 x80 x94would be that bergoglio has deposed himself by promulgating heresy fracturing the church xe2 x80 x99s universal discipline respecting marriage and the eucharist and undermining the teaching of even his own immediate predecessors on matters of fundamental morality upheld by the magisterium for two millennia nsurely the church cannot be without any remedy for a pope who relentlessly attacks her very foundations nto quote cajetan again xe2 x80 x9cindeed the church has the right to separate herself from an heretical pope according to divine law nconsequently it has the right by the same divine law to use all means of themselves necessary for such separation and those that juridically correspond to the crime are of themselves necessary xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x94meaning the resort to an imperfect council nif a synod was able to declare the deposition of a pope in 1046 why not an imperfect council today xe2 x80 x94or for that matter another synod nit will be argued that such a deposition would provoke massive schisms in the church nbut that would not be the first time that defense of the church xe2 x80 x99s common good has done so as the great western schism demonstrates nand are we not in the midst of schisms already provoked by none other than bergoglio himself whose insane drive to shatter the church xe2 x80 x99s bimillennial discipline has produced the totally unprecedented situation in which what is still considered mortally sinful in one diocese is an imperative of xe2 x80 x9cmercy xe2 x80 x9d in another nin any case this much is certain barring bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s conversion and reversal of course the church cannot abide this pontificate any longer none way or another the church will have to repel an attacker at her very summit neither the human element of the church will act according to the means which seem possible however extraordinary or heaven itself will intervene in a manner that might well involve a divine chastisement due to the negligence of timeserving pastors who left their sheep completely undefended against the wolves who preyed upon them including the wolf the cardinals improvidently elected pope nsome four months before archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 xe2 x80 x99s testimony cardinal willem jacobus eijk the archbishop of utrecht netherlands perhaps the most liberal territory in the entire church protested that bergoglio xe2 x80 x99s blatant nod to intercommunion with protestants in germany means that xe2 x80 x9cthe bishops and above all the successor of peter fail to maintain and transmit faithfully and in unity the deposit of faith contained in sacred tradition and sacred scripture xe2 x80 x9d and that the situation reminds him of article 675 of the catechism of the catholic church which refers to the church xe2 x80 x99s xe2 x80 x9cfinal trial xe2 x80 x9d before the second coming xe2 x80 x9cthat will shake the faith of many believers xe2 x80 xa6 a xe2 x80 x98mystery of iniquity xe2 x80 x99 in the form of a religious deception offering men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of apostasy from the truth nwhat can the church do when confronted by a pope who as a prominent cardinal declares to the whole world xe2 x80 x9cfails to maintain and transmit faithfully xe2 x80 xa6 the deposit of faith contained in sacred tradition and sacred scripture xe2 x80 x9d and is leading xe2 x80 x9can apostasy from the truth xe2 x80 x9d nit seems absurd to argue that she can do nothing but exhort the faithful to pray and do penance while a papal malefactor treated as if were an absolute dictator is allowed to continue wreaking havoc upon faith and morals to the detriment of countless souls without the least impediment for so long as he shall live nno bergoglio must go nthe successors of the apostles the only ones in a position to end his rampage must demand his resignation and should he refuse as expected act in this unprecedented emergency to declare his removal from the office he has criminally abused and whose very credibility he threatens to destroy nmay god give them the grace to do what must be done and what history will vindicate as a rescue of the church during the height of the worst crisis in her history

x9cfoggy xe2 x80 x9d at the time nthe new yorker article also noted that the magazine xe2 x80 x9chas not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that kavanaugh was present at the party xe2 x80 x9d nmeanwhile the everpresent michael avenatti attorney of porn star stormy daniels tweeted that he had information from anonymous sources that judge kavanaugh and his friend had targeted women with drugs and alcohol at parties to facilitate gang rape nhaters of judge kavanaugh are turning the process of senate confirmation of a supreme court nominee into something worse than a travesty nhis opponents in the senate have transformed their xe2 x80 x9cadvise and consent xe2 x80 x9d function into a campaign of noholds barred character assassination n nwhile judge kavanaugh weathers these latest accusations which he adamantly denies his real test will be on thursday assuming that christine blasey ford will follow through on her agreement to testify at an open hearing of the senate judiciary committee nher attorneys stalled for a week before making the announcement that ms ford would testify despite certain xe2 x80 x9cunresolved xe2 x80 x9d issues namong the issues ms ford xe2 x80 x99s attorneys have raised was the refusal of the committee to subpoena one of the purported witnesses mark judge who ms ford reportedly claims was involved in the alleged incident as well as xe2 x80 x9cwho on the majority side will be asking the questions whether senators or staff attorneys na week has already gone by since ms ford went public with her story in an interview with the washington post while ms ford and her attorneys stalled for time nthey raised one procedural issue after another while claiming that the committee majority was xe2 x80 x9cbullying xe2 x80 x9d ms ford nsenate judiciary committee chairman charles grassley ri has bent over backwards to accommodate ms ford xe2 x80 x99s preferred scheduling for her appearance nhe extended the deadline several times for her to come to a decision on whether to testify at all nhe had offered various options for her to testify publicly or privately or to be interviewed by committee staff in her home state of california whichever setting would make her more comfortable nhowever in senator grassley xe2 x80 x99s email thanking ms ford for finally agreeing to a time certain for her testimony senator grassley correctly reminded her attorneys that xe2 x80 x9cthe committee determines which witnesses to call how many witnesses to call and what order to call them and who will question them nthese are nonnegotiable xe2 x80 x9d nwhile the negotiations with ms ford xe2 x80 x99s attorneys for her testimony were underway democrats were sitting on the latest allegations ready to pounce as soon as ms ford xe2 x80 x99s accusation was about to be heard nsome democrats are already using the ramirez episode to push anew for a fresh fbi investigation and to postpone thursday xe2 x80 x99s scheduled hearing nideally if the democrats cannot apply enough pressure to force a withdrawal of judge kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s nomination through their relentless campaign of character assassination they want to push any senate votes until after the midterm elections at the earliest nthen they will claim that the newly elected senators should be involved in the confirmation decision nin the meantime judge kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s adversaries in the senate the mainstream media and progressive circles continue to bludgeon judge kavanaugh in the court of public opinion nall of their stratagems are an obvious attempt to buy time in order to persuade any wavering senators that judge kavanaugh is too tainted by sexual assault charges xe2 x80 x93 whether proven or not  to sit on the supreme court nproof does not matter to those wanting to bring judge kavanaugh down at any cost nregarding ms ford xe2 x80 x99s accusation they know that the proof so far is nonexistent aside from ms ford xe2 x80 x99s own assertions contained in her confidential letter given to senator dianne feinstein the ranking member of the judiciary committee last july and in her washington post interview nwhile a redacted version of ms ford xe2 x80 x99s letter has been published senator feinstein has refused to date to give even senator grassley a copy of the completely unredacted version nthe fbi has already conducted 6 background checks no federal crime is alleged and there is no forensic evidence to investigate after 30 years at a site that ms ford cannot even identify nwhat we do know so far tends to undercut the credibility of ms ford xe2 x80 x99s accusation nms ford cannot corroborate her decadesold charge of sexual assault against judge kavanaugh nwhatever corroboration ms ford was hoping for from xe2 x80 x9cwitnesses xe2 x80 x9d she claimed were at the alleged party is nonexistent nthe individuals she reportedly named in her unredacted confidential letter given to senator feinstein have either denied being at such a party or do not recollect what ms ford has alleged nmoreover by her own admission to the washington post ms ford xe2 x80 x9csaid she does not remember some key details of the incident xe2 x80 x9d she does not remember for example where it happened how the party came together in the first place or how she got home after the alleged incident nshe believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982 but reportedly could not be more precise on the day or even the month of the party nafraid that ms ford xe2 x80 x99s sexual assault allegation could be readily challenged and anxious to establish some sort of pattern of sexual misconduct beyond this single alleged incident the kavanaugh haters have latched onto ms ramirez xe2 x80 x99s story nthe new york times published an oped column last week by a psychiatrist richard a friedman who cited neurological science to conclude that ms ford xe2 x80 x99s claim that she has xe2 x80 x9ca vivid memory of an attack that took place when she was 15 xe2 x80 x9d is xe2 x80 x9ccredible xe2 x80 x9d the reason he wrote is that xe2 x80 x9cmemories formed under the influence of intense emotion xe2 x80 x94 such as the feelings that accompany a sexual assault xe2 x80 x94 are indelible in the way that memories of a routine day are not xe2 x80 x9d the only problem with dr friedman xe2 x80 x99s thesis is that ms ford has apparently forgotten such key details surrounding the alleged sexual assault as when and where it happened and how she got home nmoreover when ms ford finally told someone about the incident in any detail some 30 years later in 2012 during a couples therapy session with her husband she did not name judge kavanaugh specifically according to the therapist xe2 x80 x99s notes that ms ford had provided to the washington post in connection with her interview nthe washington post reported that the therapist xe2 x80 x99s notes it reviewed xe2 x80 x9cdo not mention kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students xe2 x80 x98from an elitist boys xe2 x80 x99 school xe2 x80 x99 who went on to become xe2 x80 x98highly respected and highranking members of society in washington xe2 x80 x99 xe2 x80 x9d nms ramirez xe2 x80 x99s story is even less credible nit took an attorney and six days of very belated reflection to help revive her memory of an incident she claimed happened while she herself was very drunk nsenator mazie hirono dhawaii one of judge kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s fiercest critics who told men to xe2 x80 x9cshut up xe2 x80 x9d regarding ms ford xe2 x80 x99s allegations said she doubts judge kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s credibility because of xe2 x80 x9chow he approaches his cases xe2 x80 x9d aside from mischaracterizing the constitutional textualist reasoning underlying judge kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s opinions she is saying that she does not believe judge kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s denial of the sexual misconduct allegations lodged against him because of the opinions he wrote that she does not like nsuch circular xe2 x80 x9creasoning xe2 x80 x9d would be amusing if it were not so emblematic of what one writer called xe2 x80 x9ckavanaugh derangement syndrome nsenator kirsten gillibrand dny is also suffering from the same syndrome nshe said thursday regarding ms ford i believe her because she is telling the truth and you know it by her story nms ford xe2 x80 x99s supporters are exploiting the xe2 x80 x9cme too xe2 x80 x9d movement to declare judge kavanaugh guilty simply because ms ford is a woman who has made what they call without any corroborating evidence to date a xe2 x80 x9ccredible xe2 x80 x9d charge nthe same would presumably be the case for ms ramirez nthey argue that since the senate judiciary committee is not a criminal judicial trial but rather a legislative hearing for confirmation of a supreme court nominee the normal burden of proof shouldered by the accuser should not apply njudge kavanaugh should have to prove that he is not guilty they are in effect insisting nthis is another case of kavanaugh derangement syndrome nlet xe2 x80 x99s assume for the sake of argument that the normal burden on the prosecution in a criminal case  to prove the accused xe2 x80 x99s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt  is not applicable regarding the charge against judge kavanaugh since he is not a defendant in a criminal trial nhowever that should not flip the burden of proof onto judge kavanaugh altogether njudge kavanaugh is being subjected to charges of a criminal nature that could not only deprive him of a seat on the supreme court for which he is otherwise eminently qualified nms ford xe2 x80 x99s unsubstantiated accusation can completely destroy judge kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s life by causing irreparable damage to his reputation for integrity and good character and to his career which he has built up during decades of public service nhis family xe2 x80 x99s lives have been completely upended nplacing the burden on judge kavanaugh to prove that he was not involved in an uncorroborated incident from years ago about which even his accuser does not recall key details turns the fundamental constitutional principle of due process upside down nms ford should have the burden to prove her accusations by at least a preponderance of all the evidence presented nthis charade must come to an end nno more extensions for ms ford to come forward and testify nif ms ford does not follow through with her agreement to testify in an open senate judiciary committee hearing this thursday and do so upon the conditions set by the committee she should go home while the committee proceeds to an immediate vote on judge kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s nomination nif ms ford and judge kavanaugh do testify the senators deciding on whether to confirm judge kavanaugh as well as the american public following the testimony must remember one cardinal rule nin a nation guided by fairness and law a person is innocent until proven guilty nsadly many of judge kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s haters have thrown that rule aside nif judge kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s nomination is pulled as a result of the smears and character assassination president trump should immediately nominate someone on his short list such as amy coney barrett and the senate republican majority should then push through the new nominee

democrats nsenator dianne feinstein sat for months on ford xe2 x80 x99s letter and then xe2 x80 x93 xe2 x80 x93just as the dems did in 1991with anita hill xe2 x80 x99s charges of sexual harassment against clarence thomas xe2 x80 x99s during his hearings xe2 x80 x93 xe2 x80 x93released it only when kavanaugh appeared to be heading for confirmation nfeinstein still hasn xe2 x80 x99t given the

ramirez xe2 x80 x99s account of a drunken party filled with obscene drinking games where he exposed himself to ramirez ngiven that the democrats had made public in advance their intention to derail the hearings and confirmation by any means possible the timing of both sexual assault charges reeks of premeditated contrivance intended to delay confirmation as long as possible nbut in the face of this naked ploy to bork kavanaugh and derail the confirmation process for partisan advantage the republicans seem to be reverting to their customary preemptive cringe nall the dems have to do is squeal xe2 x80 x9csexism xe2 x80 x9d and republicans start negotiating and offering concessions nof course after each concession comes another demand nfirst the dems demanded that ford a longtime democrat activist xe2 x80 x9cbe heard xe2 x80 x9d so last week the chairman of judiciary committee chuck grassley granted another deadline extension for ford to decide whether to testify before the

x80 x9d is another delaying tactic nford has finally agreed to testify set for thursday for now nbut it xe2 x80 x99s unclear whether grassley has granted ford any of her preposterous conditions for

same concession nothing material will be gained nher accusation will not be proved true or false nwe will learn nothing about kavanaugh that makes him any less eminently qualified for the supreme court nothing that can add to the thousands of pages of documents already presented to the committee or the hundreds of hours of the judge xe2 x80 x99s testimony before rabid partisans and

sourced even for the new york times xe2 x80 x93 xe2 x80 x93 are desperately attempting to obstruct and delay the process until after the midterm elections when they hope they will retake the senate and thus stop any more constitutionalist judges from being confirmed to the court for the rest of trump xe2 x80 x99s term nthe democrats have stooped so low with these smears because they know the stakes nthe courts and especially the supreme court have been critical to the progressives xe2 x80 x99 program since woodrow wilson nthe biggest obstacle to the progressive dream of government controlled and managed by a technocratic oligarchy has been the constitution nits divided and balanced powers were designed precisely to rein in overreaching ambition and concentrations of power nhence the constitutional order must be subverted by the supreme court and its unaccountable justices enjoying lifelong tenure nbut if kavanaugh is confirmed there will be five reliably constitutionalist justices on the bench who are unlikely to tolerate judicial usurpation of congress xe2 x80 x99s lawmaking powers nthat xe2 x80 x99s why this current nomination is a hill the dems are willing to beclown themselves on ngiven how obviously partisan and hypocritical this ploy is xe2 x80 x93 xe2 x80 x93doesn xe2 x80 x99t keith ellison xe2 x80 x99s accuser deserve to be heard and believed too n xe2 x80 x93 xe2 x80 x93why has grassley so far allowed himself to be played by the dems nbecause republicans fear the backlash from all those women voters who presumably agree with the fundamentalist feminists and insist that every accusation of sexual assault no matter how much it xe2 x80 x99s unsupported by corroborating evidence or even plausibility must be believed nthis contention itself is an expression of the radical feminist narrative of innate male feral sexuality that makes them sexual predators nthe irony is that today xe2 x80 x99s feminists have been willing to sacrifice the earlier narrative of female power and agency that had been stifled by traditional views of the sexes and their capabilities ninstead now women are victorian hothouse flowers too delicate to make their way through their lives without the paternal federal government protecting them with its coercive power nwomen have exchanged one form of dependence and one double standard for another nthe dems are using ford and ramirez as part of the democrats xe2 x80 x99 transparently dishonest delaying tactics because they know that most republicans have accepted this duplicitous feminist narrative and fear challenging it nespecially after the recent spate of sexual assault charges xe2 x80 x93 xe2 x80 x93many of them true some false others contested xe2 x80 x93 xe2 x80 x93

321,vigan xc3 xb2 doubles down accuses francis of losing sight of christ n narchbishop vigan xc3 xb2 has released a new powerful statement necessitated by the peculiar reaction of pope francis to the aug 22 testimony nmany thanks to our friends at lifesitenews especially diane montagna for the following translation and release of the followup testimony from arguably the most courageous prelate in the church today xe2 x80 x94archbishop carlo maria vigan xc3 xb2 nthe former apostolic nuncio to the united states has as they say doubled down nfar from backingaway and making excuses for his early actions as we xe2 x80 x99ve all become so accustomed to seeing in these rare cases where a hierarch breaks ranks archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 is digging in with a 4page bombshell that restates his initial accusations of abuse coverup against francis and other powerful members of the hierarchy and even concludes with a suggestion that francis is beginning to act as a xe2 x80 x9csubstitute of our lord xe2 x80 x9d nread the archbishop xe2 x80 x99s words for yourselves and note well the ring of truth that resonates in every sentence nthis is clearly the testimony of an honest man who has only the good of the church in his heart xe2 x80 x94a modernday athanasius standing against something so much worse than liberius nfriends let us pray for archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 nhe is standing alone now and not only against the most dangerous pontificate in history but also the forces of hell itself xe2 x80 x94forces which will do all in their power to silence this voice crying in the wilderness nmake no mistake about this archbishop vigan xc3 xb2 is fighting for the very survival of the human element of the catholic church nhe is standing against corrupt men in high places who cannot be trusted to do what is best for souls for the catholic faithful or indeed for holy mother church herself nthe enemy is not only at the gates but has now made their way to the thrones of power and the seats of the apostles ngod help us nit goes without saying that we here at the remnant not only stand with vigan xc3 xb2 but we thank god for him every day we pray the rosary for him every day and wish him every blessing and heavenly consolation as he undergoes this passion for the sake of the master he serves so well ngod bless you your excellency and mary keep you nwe are with you nmjm n ntit narchbishop of ulpiana napostolic nuncio nscio cui credidi n2 tim 112 nbefore starting my writing i would first of all like to give thanks and glory to god the father for every situation and trial that he has prepared and will prepare for me during my life nas a priest and bishop of the holy church spouse of christ i am called like every baptized person to bear witness to the truth nby the gift of the spirit who sustains me with joy on the path that i am called to travel i intend to do so until the end of my days nour only lord has addressed also to me the invitation xe2 x80 x9cfollow me xe2 x80 x9d and i intend to follow him with the help of his grace until the end of my days n xe2 x80 x9cas long as i have life i will sing to the lord ni will sing praise to my god while i have being nmay my song be pleasing to him nfor i rejoice in the lord xe2 x80 x9d npsalm 1033334 n nit has been a month since i offered my testimony solely for the good of the church regarding what occurred at the audience with pope francis on june 23 2013 and regarding certain matters i was given to know in the assignments entrusted to me at the secretariat of state and in washington in relation to those who bear responsibility for covering up the crimes committed by the former archbishop of that capital nmy decision to reveal those grave facts was for me the most painful and serious decision that i have ever made in my life ni made it after long reflection and prayer during months of profound suffering and anguish during a crescendo of continual news of terrible events with thousands of innocent victims destroyed and the vocations and lives of young priests and religious disturbed nthe silence of the pastors who could have provided a remedy and prevented new victims became increasingly indefensible a devastating crime for the church nwell aware of the enormous consequences that my testimony could have because what i was about to reveal involved the successor of peter himself i nonetheless chose to speak in order to protect the church and i declare with a clear conscience before god that my testimony is true nchrist died for the church and peter servus servorum dei is the first one called to serve the spouse of christ ncertainly some of the facts that i was to reveal were covered by the pontifical secret that i had promised to observe and that i had faithfully observed from the beginning of my service to the holy see nbut the purpose of any secret including the pontifical secret is to protect the church from her enemies not to cover up and become complicit in crimes committed by some of her members ni was a witness not by my choice of shocking facts and as the catechism of the catholic church states par n2491 the seal of secrecy is not binding when very grave harm can be avoided only by divulging the truth nonly the seal of confession could have justified my silence nneither the pope nor any of the cardinals in rome have denied the facts i asserted in my testimony n xe2 x80 x9cqui tacet consentit xe2 x80 x9d surely applies here for if they deny my testimony they have only to say so and provide documentation to support that denial nhow can one avoid concluding that the reason they do not provide the documentation is that they know it confirms my testimony nthe center of my testimony was that since at least june 23 2013 the pope knew from me how perverse and evil mccarrick was in his intentions and actions and instead of taking the measures that every good pastor would have taken the pope made mccarrick one of his principal agents in governing the church in regard to the united states the curia and even china as we are seeing these days with great concern and anxiety for that martyr church nnow the pope xe2 x80 x99s reply to my testimony was xe2 x80 x9ci will not say a word xe2 x80 x9d but then contradicting himself he has compared his silence to that of jesus in nazareth and before pilate and compared me to the great accuser satan who sows scandal and division in the church xe2 x80 x94 though without ever uttering my name nif he had said xe2 x80 x9cvigan xc3 xb2 lied xe2 x80 x9d he would have challenged my credibility while trying to affirm his own nin so doing he would have intensified the demand of the people of god and the world for the documentation needed to determine who has told the truth ninstead he put in place a subtle slander against me xe2 x80 x94 slander being an offense he has often compared to the gravity of murder nindeed he did it repeatedly in the context of the celebration of the most holy sacrament the eucharist where he runs no risk of being challenged by journalists nwhen he did speak to journalists he asked them to exercise their professional maturity and draw their own conclusions nbut how can journalists discover and know the truth if those directly involved with a matter refuse to answer any questions or to release any documents nthe pope xe2 x80 x99s unwillingness to respond to my charges and his deafness to the appeals by the faithful for accountability are hardly consistent with his calls for transparency and bridge building nmoreover the pope xe2 x80 x99s coverup of mccarrick was clearly not an isolated mistake nmany more instances have recently been documented in the press showing that pope francis has defended homosexual clergy who committed serious sexual abuses against minors or adults nthese include his role in the case of fr njulio grassi in buenos aires his reinstatement of fr nmauro inzoli after pope benedict had removed him from ministry until he went to prison at which point pope francis laicized him and his halting of the investigation of sex abuse allegations against cardinal cormac murphy o xe2 x80 x99connor nin the meantime a delegation of the usccb headed by its president cardinal dinardo went to rome asking for a vatican investigation into mccarrick ncardinal dinardo and the other prelates should tell the church in america and in the world did the pope refuse to carry out a vatican investigation into mccarrick xe2 x80 x99s crimes and of those responsible for covering them up nthe faithful deserve to know ni would like to make a special appeal to cardinal ouellet because as nuncio i always worked in great harmony with him and i have always had great esteem and affection towards him nhe will remember when at the end of my mission in washington he received me at his apartment in rome in the evening for a long conversation nat the beginning of pope francis xe2 x80 x99 pontificate he had maintained his dignity as he had shown with courage when he was archbishop of qu xc3 xa9bec nlater however when his work as prefect of the congregation for bishops was being undermined because recommendations for episcopal appointments were being passed directly to pope francis by two homosexual xe2 x80 x9cfriends xe2 x80 x9d of his dicastery bypassing the cardinal he gave up nhis long article in l xe2 x80 x99osservatore romano in which he came out in favor of the more controversial aspects of amoris laetitia represents his surrender nyour eminence before i left for washington you were the one who told me of pope benedict xe2 x80 x99s sanctions on mccarrick nyou have at your complete disposal key documents incriminating mccarrick and many in the curia for their coverups nyour eminence i urge you to bear witness to the truth n nfinally i wish to encourage you dear faithful my brothers and sisters in christ never be despondent nmake your own the act of faith and complete confidence in christ jesus our savior of saint paul in his second letter to timothy scio cui credidi which i choose as my episcopal motto nthis is a time of repentance of conversion of prayers of grace to prepare the church the bride of the lamb ready to fight and win with mary the battle against the old dragon n,"['appeal_to_fear-prejudice', 'loaded_language', 'doubt', 'flag-waving',

2010 he dissented from the dc circuit xe2 x80 x99s decision not to rehear a case in which a threejudge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealer xe2 x80 x99s fourth amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching a gps device to his car without a warrant nkavanaugh claimed that putting a gps tracking device on a person xe2 x80 x99s car without first obtaining a warrant was just fine because it didn xe2 x80 x99t constitute a xe2 x80 x9csearch xe2 x80 x9d as defined by the fourth amendment nto kavanaugh bypassing the courts and tracking an

property or track someone xe2 x80 x99s cell phone nluckily he was the only judge on the panel to think this nin june the supreme court ruled specifically on this case noting that collecting such information actually does constitute a search and therefore requires a warrant nbut it gets worse nin 2015 kavanaugh issued a statement strongly defending the nsa xe2 x80 x99s phone metadata collection program arguing that it is xe2 x80 x9centirely consistent with the fourth amendment xe2 x80 x9d to kavanaugh sweeping programs that collect information from innocent citizens xe2 x80 x99 phones are not in conflict with having the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure nseriously naccording to kavanaugh the fourth amendment allows for searches xe2 x80 x9cwithout

before any hearing occurred nafraid of their own shadows committee republicans didn xe2 x80 x99t relish the prospect of their allmale team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sexcrimes prosecutor rachel mitchell of maricopa county arizona to examine ford nopinions differ widely on how mitchell performed nshe tiptoed around the alleged sexual assault itself instead focusing on processrelated questions presumably in an effort to show undecided senators how ford and her handlers have been unfairly manipulating the process nin much of her testimony ford came across as presentable and seemingly credible though vague and sometimes evasive her ridiculous overall story notwithstanding nford did well enough that during the break between her testimony and kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s commentators on fox news such as brit hume and andrew napolitano were openly musing about the nominee withdrawing opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later nit xe2 x80 x99s not that mitchell did a bad job creating an inventory of the irregularities in the process and of the odd behavior of ford and her lawyers nshe could do little else nshe had many restrictions placed upon her and was only allowed to question ford for minutes at a time before surrendering the floor to the next committee democrat nas commentator sean davis tweeted n xe2

her best friendhas denied it xe2 x80 x9d nnonetheless mitchell xe2 x80 x99s questioning came across at times as perfunctory leading many observers to conclude that republicans threw away a valuable opportunity by using her as a standin nshe failed to lay a glove on a witness whose implausible internally contradictory story cried out for vigorous crossexamination nin the end the toodeferential easygoing mitchell failed to provide much if anything in the way of evidence against ford or in favor of kavanaugh nwhether her work will bring over fencesitting senators to kavanaugh xe2 x80 x99s side remains to be seen nlike other democrats sen mazie hirono of hawaii tried to help ford lobbing her softballs nafter saying she thought she knew what mitchell was trying to get at in her questions

351,assange never met manafort nluke harding and the guardian publish still more blatant mi6 lies n nthe right wing ecuadorean government of president moreno continues to churn out its production line of fake documents regarding julian assange and channel them straight to mi6 mouthpiece luke harding of the guardian namazingly more ecuadorean government documents have just been discovered for the guardian this time spy agency reports detailing visits of paul manafort and unspecified xe2 x80 x9crussians xe2 x80 x9d to the embassy nby a wonderful coincidence of timing this is the day after mueller announced that manafort xe2 x80 x99s plea deal was over nthe problem with this latest fabrication is that moreno had already released the visitor logs to the mueller inquiry nneither manafort nor these xe2 x80 x9crussians xe2 x80 x9d are in the visitor logs nthis is impossible nthe visitor logs were not kept by wikileaks but by the very strict ecuadorean security nnobody was ever admitted without being entered in the logs nthe procedure was very thorough nto go in you had to submit your passport no other type of document was accepted na copy of your passport was taken and the passport details entered into the log nyour passport along with your mobile phone and any other electronic equipment was retained until you left along with your bag and coat ni feature in the logs every time i visited nthere were no exceptions nfor an exception to be made for manafort and the xe2 x80 x9crussians xe2 x80 x9d would have had to be a decision of the government of ecuador not of wikileaks and that would be so exceptional the reason for it would surely have been noted in the now leaked supposed ecuadorean xe2 x80 x9cintelligence report xe2 x80 x9d of the visits nwhat possible motive would the ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by paul manafort nfurthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency xe2 x80 x93 who were in charge of the security xe2 x80 x93 would not know the identity of these alleged xe2 x80 x9crussians xe2 x80 x9d npreviously harding and the guardian have published documents faked by the moreno government regarding a diplomatic appointment to russia for assange of which he had no knowledge nnow they follow this up with more documents aimed to provide fictitious evidence to bolster mueller xe2 x80 x99s pathetically failed attempt to substantiate the story that russia deprived hillary of the presidency nmy friend william binney probably the world xe2 x80 x99s greatest expert on electronic surveillance former technical director of the nsa has stated that it is impossible the dnc servers were hacked the technical evidence shows it was a download to a directly connected memory stick ni knew the us security services were conducting a fake investigation the moment it became clear that the fbi did not even themselves look at the dnc servers instead accepting a report from the clinton linked dnc xe2 x80 x9csecurity consultants xe2 x80 x9d crowdstrike ni would love to believe that the fact julian has never met manafort is bound to be established nbut i fear that state control of propaganda may be such that this massive xe2 x80 x9cbig lie xe2 x80 x9d will come to enter public consciousness in the same way as the nonexistent russian hack of the dnc servers nassange never met manafort nthe dnc emails were downloaded by an insider nassange never even considered fleeing to russia nthose are the facts and i am in a position to give you a personal assurance of them ni can also assure you that luke harding the guardian washington post and new york times have been publishing a stream of deliberate lies in collusion with the security services ni am not a fan of donald trump nbut to see the partisans of the defeated candidate and a particularly obnoxious defeated candidate manipulate the security services and the media to create an entirely false public perception in order to attempt to overturn the result of the us presidential election is the most astonishing thing i have witnessed in my lifetime nplainly the government of ecuador is releasing lies about assange to curry favour with the security establishment of the usa and uk and to damage assange xe2 x80 x99s support prior to expelling him from the embassy nhe will then be extradited from london to the usa on charges of espionage nassange is not a whistleblower or a spy xe2 x80 x93 he is the greatest publisher of his age and has done more to bring the crimes of governments to light than the mainstream media will ever be motivated to achieve nthat supposedly great newspaper titles like the guardian new york times and washington post are involved in the spreading of lies to damage assange and are seeking his imprisonment for publishing state secrets is clear evidence that the idea of the xe2 x80 x9cliberal media xe2 x80 x9d no longer exists in the new plutocratic age nthe press are not on the side of the

longstanding allegations that assange conspired with trump and trump xe2 x80 x99s supposed backers in the kremlin to damage hillary clinton during the 2016 presidential race nthe guardian xe2 x80 x99s latest story provides a supposedly stronger foundation for an existing narrative that assange and wikileaks knowingly published emails hacked by russia from the democratic party xe2 x80 x99s servers nin truth there is no public evidence that the emails were hacked or that russia was involved ncentral actors have suggested instead that the emails were leaked from within the democratic party nnonetheless this unverified allegation has been aggressively exploited by the democratic leadership because it shifts attention away both from its failure to mount an effective electoral challenge to trump and from the damaging contents of the emails nthese show that party bureaucrats sought to rig the primaries to make sure clinton xe2 x80 x99s challenger for the democratic nomination bernie sanders lost nto underscore the intended effect of the guardian xe2 x80 x99s new claims harding even throws in a casual and unsubstantiated reference to xe2 x80 x9crussians xe2 x80 x9d joining manafort in supposedly meeting assange nmanafort has denied the guardian xe2 x80 x99s claims while assange has threatened to sue the guardian for libel n xe2 x80 x98responsible for trump xe2 x80 x99 nthe emotional impact of the guardian story is to suggest that assange is responsible for four years or more of trump rule nbut more significantly it bolsters the otherwise risible claim that assange is not a publisher xe2 x80 x93 and thereby entitled to the protections of a free press as enjoyed by the guardian or the new york times xe2 x80 x93 but the head of an organisation engaged in espionage for a foreign power nthe intention is to deeply discredit assange and by extension the wikileaks organisation in the eyes of rightthinking liberals nthat in turn will make it much easier to silence assange and the vital cause he represents the use of new media to hold to account the old corporate media and political elites through the imposition of far greater transparency nthe guardian story will prepare public opinion for the moment when ecuador xe2 x80 x99s rightwing government under president lenin moreno forces assange out of the embassy having already withdrawn most of his rights to use digital media nit will soften opposition when the uk moves to arrest assange on selfserving bail violation charges and extradites him to the us nand it will pave the way for the us legal system to lock assange up for a very long time nfor the best part of a decade any claims by assange xe2 x80 x99s supporters that avoiding this fate was the reason assange originally sought asylum in the embassy was ridiculed by corporate journalists not least at the guardian neven when a united nations panel of experts in international law ruled in 2016 that assange was being arbitrarily xe2 x80 x93 and unlawfully xe2 x80 x93 detained by the uk guardian writers led efforts to discredit the un report nsee here and here nnow assange and his supporters have been proved right once again nan administrative error this month revealed that the us justice department had secretly filed criminal charges against assange nheavy surveillance nthe problem for the guardian which should have been obvious to its editors from the outset is that any visits by manafort would be easily verifiable without relying on unnamed xe2 x80 x9csources xe2 x80 x9d nglenn greenwald is far from alone in noting that london is possibly the most surveilled city in the world with cctv cameras everywhere nthe environs of the ecuadorian embassy are monitored especially heavily with continuous filming by the uk and ecuadorian authorities and most likely by the us and other actors with an interest in assange xe2 x80 x99s fate nthe idea that manafort or xe2 x80 x9crussians xe2 x80 x9d could have wandered into the embassy to meet assange even once without their trail entry and meeting being intimately scrutinised and recorded is simply preposterous naccording to greenwald xe2 x80 x9cif paul manafort xe2 x80 xa6 visited assange at the embassy there would be ample amounts of video and other photographic proof demonstrating that this happened nthe guardian provides none of that xe2 x80 x9d nformer british ambassador craig murray also points out the extensive security checks insisted on by the embassy to which any visitor to assange must submit nany visits by manafort would have been logged nin fact the guardian obtained the embassy xe2 x80 x99s logs in may and has never made any mention of either manafort or xe2 x80 x9crussians xe2 x80 x9d being identified in them nit did not refer to the logs in its latest story nmurray nthe problem with this latest fabrication is that ecuador xe2 x80 x99s president moreno had already released the visitor logs to the mueller inquiry nneither manafort nor these xe2 x80 x9crussians xe2 x80 x9d are in the visitor logs xe2 x80 xa6 what possible motive would the ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by paul manafort nfurthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency xe2 x80 x93 who were in charge of the security xe2 x80 x93 would not know the identity of these alleged xe2 x80 x9crussians xe2 x80 x9d nno factchecking nit is worth noting it should be vitally important for a serious publication like the guardian to ensure its claims are unassailably true xe2 x80 x93 both because assange xe2 x80 x99s personal fate rests on their veracity and because even more importantly a fundamental right the freedom of the press is at stake ngiven this one would have expected the guardian xe2 x80 x99s editors to have insisted on the most stringent checks imaginable before going to press with harding xe2 x80 x99s story nat a very minimum they should have sought out a response from assange and manafort before publication nneither precaution was taken ni worked for the guardian for a number of years and know well the layers of checks that any highly sensitive story has to go through before publication nin that lengthy process a variety of commissioning editors lawyers backbench editors and the editor herself kath viner would normally insist on cuts to anything that could not be rigorously defended and corroborated nand yet this piece seems to have been casually waved through given a green light even though its profound shortcomings were evident to a range of wellplaced analysts and journalists from the outset nthat at the very least hints that the guardian thought they had xe2 x80 x9cinsurance xe2 x80 x9d on this story nand the only people who could have promised that kind of insurance are the security and intelligence services xe2 x80 x93 presumably of britain the united states and  or ecuador nit appears the guardian has simply taken this story provided by spooks at face value neven if it later turns out that manafort did visit assange the guardian clearly had no compelling evidence for its claims when it published them nthat is profoundly irresponsible journalism xe2 x80 x93 fake news xe2 x80 x93 that should be of the gravest concern to readers na pattern not an aberration ndespite all this even analysts critical of the guardian xe2 x80 x99s behaviour have shown a glaring failure to understand that its latest coverage represents not an aberration by the paper but decisively fits with a pattern nglenn greenwald who once had an influential column in the guardian until an apparent though unacknowledged falling out with his employer over the edward snowden revelations wrote a series of baffling observations about the guardian xe2 x80 x99s latest story nfirst he suggested it was simply evidence of the guardian xe2 x80 x99s longstanding and welldocumented hostility towards assange n xe2 x80 x9cthe guardian an otherwise solid and reliable paper has such a pervasive and unprofessionally personal hatred for julian assange that it has frequently dispensed with all journalistic standards in order to malign him xe2 x80 x9d nit was also apparently evidence of the paper xe2 x80 x99s clickbait tendencies n xe2 x80 x9cthey guardian editors knew that publishing this story would cause partisan warriors to excitedly spread the story and that cable news outlets would hyperventilate over it and that they xe2 x80 x99d reap the rewards regardless of whether the story turned out to be true or false xe2 x80 x9d nand finally in a bizarre tweet greenwald opined xe2 x80 x9ci hope the story maligning assange turns out true xe2 x80 x9d xe2 x80 x93 apparently because maintenance of the guardian xe2 x80 x99s reputation is more important than assange xe2 x80 x99s fate and the right of journalists to dig up embarrassing secrets without fear of being imprisoned ni think the guardian is an important paper with great journalists ni hope the story turns out true nbut the skepticism over this story is very widespread including among assange most devoted haters because it so sketchy nif manafort went there there video nlet see it n xe2 x80 x94 glenn greenwald ggreenwald november 28 2018 ndeeper malaise nwhat this misses is that the guardian xe2 x80 x99s attacks on assange are not exceptional or motivated solely by personal animosity nthey are entirely predictable and systematic nrather than being the reason for the guardian violating basic journalistic standards and ethics the paper xe2 x80 x99s hatred of assange is a symptom of a deeper malaise in the guardian and the wider corporate media neven aside from its decadelong campaign against assange the guardian is far from xe2 x80 x9csolid and reliable xe2 x80 x9d as greenwald claims nit has been at the forefront of the relentless and unhinged attacks on labour leader jeremy corbyn for prioritising the rights of palestinians over israel xe2 x80 x99s right to continue its belligerent occupation nover the past three years the guardian has injected credibility into the israel lobby xe2 x80 x99s desperate efforts to tar corbyn as an antisemite nsee here here and here nsimilarly the guardian worked tirelessly to promote clinton and undermine sanders in the 2016 democratic nomination process xe2 x80 x93 another reason the paper has been so assiduous in promoting the idea that assange aided by russia was determined to promote trump over clinton for the presidency nthe guardian xe2 x80 x99s coverage of latin america especially of populist leftwing governments that have rebelled against traditional and oppressive us hegemony in the region has long grated with analysts and experts nits especial venom has been reserved for leftwing figures like venezuela xe2 x80 x99s hugo chavez democratically elected but official enemies of the us rather than the region xe2 x80 x99s rightwing authoritarians beloved of washington nthe guardian has been vocal in the socalled xe2 x80 x9cfake news xe2 x80 x9d hysteria decrying the influence of social media the only place where leftwing dissidents have managed to find a small foothold to promote their politics and counter the corporate media narrative nthe guardian has painted social media chiefly as a platform overrun by russian trolls arguing that this should justify evertighter restrictions that have so far curbed critical voices of the dissident left more than the right nheroes of the neoliberal order nequally the guardian has made clear who its true heroes are ncertainly not corbyn or assange who threaten to disrupt the entrenched neoliberal order that is hurtling us towards climate breakdown and economic collapse nits pages however are readily available to the latest effort to prop up the status quo from tony blair the man who led britain on false pretences into the largest crime against humanity in living memory xe2 x80 x93 the attack on iraq nthat xe2 x80 x9chumanitarian intervention xe2 x80 x9d cost the lives of many hundreds of thousands of iraqis and created a vacuum that destabilised much of the middle east sucked in islamic jihadists like alqaeda and isis and contributed to the migrant crisis in europe that has fuelled the resurgence of the farright nnone of that is discussed in the guardian or considered grounds for disqualifying blair as an arbiter of what is good for britain and the world xe2 x80 x99s future nthe guardian also has an especial soft spot for blogger elliot higgins who aided by the guardian has shot to unlikely prominence as a selfstyled xe2 x80 x9cweapons expert xe2 x80 x9d nlike luke harding higgins invariably seems ready to echo whatever the british and american security services need verifying xe2 x80 x9cindependently xe2 x80 x9d nhiggins and his wellstaffed website bellingcat have taken on for themselves the role of arbiters of truth on many foreign affairs issues taking a prominent role in advocating for narratives that promote us and nato hegemony while demonising russia especially in highly contested arenas such as syria nthat clear partisanship should be no surprise given that higgins now enjoys an xe2 x80 x9cacademic xe2 x80 x9d position at and funding from the atlantic council a highlevel washingtonbased thinktank founded to drum up support for nato and justify its imperialist agenda nimprobably the guardian has adopted higgins as the posterboy for a supposed citizen journalism it has sought to undermine as xe2 x80 x9cfake news xe2 x80 x9d whenever it occurs on social media without the endorsement of statebacked organisations nthe truth is that the guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking assange or in its much longerrunning campaign to vilify him nwith this story it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake xe2 x80 x93 it simply regurgitates an eliteserving western narrative nits job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing neoliberal order whether they are a platform like wikileaks promoting whistleblowing against a corrupt western elite or a politician like jeremy corbyn seeking to break apart the status quo on the rapacious financial industries or israelpalestine or a radical leader like hugo chavez who threatened to overturn a damaging and exploitative us dominance of xe2 x80 x9camerica xe2 x80 x99s backyard xe2 x80 x9d or social media dissidents who have started to chip away at the elitefriendly narratives of corporate media including the guardian nthe guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying assange without a shred of evidence nit did what it is designed to do nupdate excellent background from investigative journalist gareth porter published shortly

369,this guardian fake news story proves that the media can t be trusted n nnovember 29 2018 nthis guardian fake news story proves that the media can t be trusted nin 2015 the british guardian appointed katherine viner as editor in chief nunder her lead the paper took a new direction nwhile it earlier made attempts to balance its shoddier side with some interesting reporting it is now solidly main stream in the worst sense nit promotes neoliberalism and a delves into cranky identity grievances stories nit also became an main outlet for manipulative propaganda peddled by the british secret services nits recent fake news story about paul manafort wikileaks and julian assange aptly demonstrates this nthe documentation of it is a bit lengthy but provides that it was a willful fake non november 27 the guardian prepared to publish a story which asserted that paula manafort trump  former campaign manager had met julian assange the publisher of wikileaks in the ecuadorian embassy in london on at least three occasions nsome two hours before the story went public it contacted manafort and assange  lawyers to get their comments nassange  wikileaks responded through its public twitter account which has 54 million followers non of those followers is katherine viner nwikileaks wikileaks  1306 utc  27 nov 2018 scoop in letter today to assange  lawyers guardian  luke harding winner of private eye  plagiarist of the year falsely claims jailed former trump campaign manager paul manafort had secret meetings with assange in 2013 2015 and 2016 in story guardian are planning to run nit attached the email the guardian  luke harding had send n90 minutes later the guardian piece went life nit led the front page and also appeared in print nthe first version read nmanafort held secret talks with assange in ecuadorian embassy donald trump xe2 x80 x99s former campaign manager paul manafort held secret talks with julian assange inside the ecuadorian embassy in london and visited around the time he joined trump xe2 x80 x99s campaign the guardian has been told nsources have said manafort went to see assange in 2013 2015 and in spring 2016 xe2 x80 x93 during the period when he was made a key figure in trump xe2 x80 x99s push for the white house nit is unclear why manafort wanted to see assange and what was discussed nbut the last meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest robert mueller the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the trump campaign and russia na wellplaced source has told the guardian that manafort went to see assange around march 2016 nmonths later wikileaks released a stash of democratic emails stolen by russian intelligence officers nmanafort 69 denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is xe2 x80 x9c100 false xe2 x80 x9d nhis lawyers declined to answer the guardian xe2 x80 x99s questions about the visits nthe piece did not include the public denial wikileaks issued to its 54 million followers one and a half hour before it was published nthe guardian piece came at a critical moment ncurrently the uk and ecuador conspire to deliver julian assange to us authorities non monday special counsel robert mueller said manafort lied to investigators violating his recent plea deal nthe new sensational claim was immediately picked up by prominent reporters and major main stream outlets nthey distributed is as a factual account nit is likely that millions of people took note of its claim nbut several people who had followed the russiagate fairytale and the mueller investigation were immediately suspicious of the guardian claim nthe story was weakly sourced and included some details that seemed unlikely to be true nglenn greenwald noted that the ecuadorian embassy is under heavy cctv surveillance nthere are several guards and visitors have to provide their identity to enter it nevery visit is logged nif manafort had really visited assange it would have long been known nin sum the guardian published a story today that it knew would explode into all sorts of viral benefits for the paper and its reporters even though there are gaping holes and highly sketchy aspects to the story nmoreover the main author of the story luke harding is known to be a notorious fraud a russophobe intelligence asset with a personal grievance towards assange and wikileaks na year ago an important moon of alabama piece  from snowden to russiagate  the cia and the media  mentioned harding nthe people who promote the russian influence nonsense are political operatives or hacks ntake for example luke harding of the guardian who just published a book titled collusion secret meetings dirty money and how russia helped donald trump win nhe was taken apart in a real news interview vid about the book nthe interviewer pointed out that there is absolutely no evidence in the book to support its claims nwhen asked for any proof for his assertion harding defensively says that he is just storytelling  in other words it is fiction nharding earlier wrote a book about edward snowden which was a similar sham njulian assange called it a hack job in the purest sense of the term nharding is also known as plagiarizer nwhen he worked in moscow he copied stories and passages from the now defunct exile run by matt taibbi and mark ames nthe guardian had to publish an apology nthe new guardian story looked like another weak attempt to connect the alleged russian malfeasance with assange and the wikileaks publishing of the dnc emails nassange and other involved people deny that such a relation existed nthere is no public evidence that support such claims nshortly after the guardian  fake news story went public paul manafort issued an unequivocal denial n xe2 x80 x9ci have never met julian assange or anyone connected to him xe2 x80 x9d the statement said n xe2 x80 x9ci have never been contacted by anyone connected to wikileaks either directly or indirectly ni have never reached out to assange or wikileaks on any matter nwe are considering all legal options against the guardian who proceeded with this story even after being notified by my representatives that it was false xe2 x80 x9d nat 1605 utc the guardian silently edited the story ncaveats here in italic and underlined were added to the headline and within several paragraphs nno editorial note was attached to inform the readers of the changes nmanafort held secret talks with assange in ecuadorian embassy sources say  nit is unclear why manafort would have wanted to see assange and what was discussed nbut the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest robert mueller the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the trump campaign and russia n nwhy manafort might have sought out assange in 2013 is unclear n nmanafort 69 denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is xe2 x80 x9c100 false xe2 x80 x9d nhis lawyers initially declined to answer the guardian xe2 x80 x99s questions about the visits none paragraph was added to included wikileaks  denial nin a series of tweets wikileaks said assange and manafort had not met nassange described the story as a hoax nat 1630 utc under fire from other media and journalists the guardian issued a statement nthis story relied on a number of sources nwe put these allegations to both paul manafort and julian assange  representatives prior to publication nneither responded to deny the visits taking place nwe have since updated the story to reflect their denials nthis defensive guardian claim is like its story evidently completely false nwikileaks publicly denied the guardian  claims 90 minutes before the story was first published nmanafort asserts that his lawyers had notified the guardian that the story was false before the guardian proceeded with the story  nat 2105 utc a third version was published which included manafort  denial nhalf an hour later julian assange instructed his lawyers to sue the guardian for libel nwikileaks opened a fund to support the lawsuit na day after the guardian smear piece the washington times reported that manafort  passports entered into evidence by the mueller prosecution show that he did not visit london in any of the years the guardian claimed he was there to visit assange nthe story was completely false and the guardian knew it was nit disregarded and left out the denials the subjects of the story had issued before it was published n nthe guardian has become a main outlet for british government disinformation operations aimed at defaming russia nit smeared assange and snowden as russian collaborators nit uncritically peddled the russiagate story and the nonsensical skripal claims which are both obviously concocted by british intelligence services nthat seems to have become its main purpose nas disobediant media notes emphasis in the original nwhile most readers with functional critical thinking capacity may readily dismiss the guardian xe2 x80 x99s smear on its face the fact that the guardian published this piece and that luke harding is still operating with even the tiniest modicum of respect as a journalist despite his history of deceit tells us something bonechilling about journalism nit is no accident that luke harding is still employed in fact it is because of harding xe2 x80 x99s consistent loyalty to establishment specifically the uk intelligence apparatus over the truth that determines his xe2 x80 x9csuccess xe2 x80 x9d amongst legacy press outlets nharding is not a defacement or a departure from the norm but the personification of it njonathan cook a former guardian writer makes a similar point nthe truth is that the guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking assange or in its much longerrunning campaign to vilify him nwith this story it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake xe2 x80 x93 it simply regurgitates an eliteserving western narrative nits job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing neoliberal order  nthe guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying assange without a shred of evidence nit did what it is designed to do nwe have previously shown that the guardian even uses fascist propaganda tropes to smear the russian people nit is openly publishing goebbels  cartoons and rhetoric against europes biggest state nthere is no longer any line that it does not dare to cross nunfortunately other western  media are not much better nwithin hours of being published the guardian piece was debunked as fake news nthat did not hinder other outlets to add to its smear npolitico allowed a former cia officer writing under a pen name to suggest  without any evidence  that the guardian has been duped  not by its mi56 and ecuadorian spy sources but by russian disinformation nrather than being the bombshell smoking gun that directly connects the trump campaign to wikileaks perhaps the report is something else entirely a disinformation campaign nis it possible someone planted this story as a means to discredit the journalists n nharding is likely a major target for anyone wrapped up in russia xe2 x80 x99s intelligence operation against the west xe2 x80 x99s democratic institutions n nif this latest story about manafort and assange is false xe2 x80 x94that is if for example the sources lied to harding and collyns or if the sources themselves were lied to and thus thought they were being truthful in their statements to the journalists or if the ecuadorian intelligence document is a fake the most logical explanation is that it is an attempt to make harding look bad nthe is zero evidence in the politico screed that supports its suggestions and claims nit is fake news about a fake news story nit also included the false claim that glenn greenwald worked with wikileaks on the snowden papers nthat claim was later removed nwe have seen a similar pattern in the skripal affair nwhen western  intelligence get caught in spreading disinformation they accuse russia of being the source of the fake nunfortunately no western main stream media can any longer be trusted to publish the truth nthe guardian is only one of many which peddle smears and disinformation about the enemies  of the ruling western interests  nit is on all of us to debunk them and to educate the public about their scheme n nthis is a moon of alabama fundraiser week nno one pays me to write these blog posts nif you
