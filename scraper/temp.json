The 20-year-old year later explained he had taken the step because of what he described as \u201cunacceptable\u201d behavior from Ukrainian rivals, whom he accused of \u201cgreatly escalating\u201d the atmosphere at the competition. \u00a0Kuliak later told RT that he displayed the \u2018Z\u2019 sign \u2013 which has been added to Russian military vehicles and equipment during the operation in Ukraine \u2013 because the symbol is \u201cfor victory and for peace,\u201d and that he would not hesitate to make the gesture again.The Gymnastics Ethics Foundation (GEF)\u00a0has opened a disciplinary case against Kuliak, with Russian head coach Valentina Rodionenko fearing at least a one-year ban for the star. Facing that prospect, Kuliak has reiterated that, in his mind, he was not in the wrong. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cIn general, I consider the decision to [potentially] suspend me unfair,\u201d said the gymnast, according to Life.ru.\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything illegal, I didn\u2019t break any rules, and now they want to ban me. In all this you can see the attitude towards our country.\u201dRussian head coach Rodionenko likewise said any ban would be unjust, explaining that she and fellow trainer Igor Kalabushkin could also be sanctioned, and accusing the Ukrainian delegation in Doha of inciting antagonism.\u201cThe international federation made this decision under pressure from the Ukrainians, and some of them even advocated our lifelong disqualification,\u201d Rodionenko told TASS.\u201cLawyers are working with us now who hope they\u2019ll save us, but personally I doubt this outcome of the case. The decision should be made at the end of March.\u201dThe veteran trainer said Kuliak could be stripped of the bronze medal he won as well as any prize money, with both herself and Kalabushkin potentially being fined. \u00a0\u201cUkrainian athletes in Doha violated all the rules of the competition, they went to the platform wrapped in their national flag, refused to participate in award ceremonies if our girls took part in them,\u201d she added. \u00a0\u201cI want to say that I\u2019ve never experienced such humiliation in my entire coaching career. I didn\u2019t experience anything like that even after our boycott of the Olympic Games in the USA in 1984.\u201cIn Qatar, they didn\u2019t humiliate us, they humiliated our country\u2026 I approached the FIG representative and asked why the Ukrainians behaved like that, to which he replied that he could do nothing about it.\u201dThe International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) announced on March 6 that it had charged the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation with opening proceedings against Kuliak, accusing him of \u201cshocking behavior.\u201dThe FIG previously said it would follow International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommendations and ban all Russian and Belarusian athletes from its events, starting from March 7 and \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d \u00a0"},{"uuid":"026d11d8-98cb-4700-8fed-277eec712ba1","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/sport\/552445-evgeny-rylov-speedo-sponsorship-luzhniki\/","title":"Olympic champion stripped of Speedo deal after Moscow concert appearance","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623987de203027108a62e851.jpg","subtitle":"Evgeny Rylov appeared at the event in Moscow last week","content":"Swimwear company Speedo has terminated its sponsorship deal with double Olympic champion Evgeny Rylov after the star attended a Moscow concert marking the reunification of Crimea with Russia.Rylov, who won gold in the 100m and 200m backstroke events at the Tokyo Games, appeared at the mass meeting at Luzhniki Stadium on Friday which was held under the banner \u2018For a World without Nazism\u2019.Officials estimated that more than 100,000 people gathered\u00a0inside the stadium and the surrounding area, as Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the crowd while a host of music stars performed.The concert was similar to events which have been held in recent years to mark the reunification with Crimea, including at Luzhniki, although sections of the Western media described this year\u2019s meeting as a \u201cpro-war rally\u201d as it comes amid Russia\u2019s military operation in Ukraine. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rylov, 25, was among the prominent Russian athletes in attendance and appeared in national team gear emblazoned with the letter \u2018Z\u2019 \u2013 a symbol which has been attached to Russian military hardware during the Ukraine conflict, and which has come to be used as a show of support for Russian forces.In light of his appearance at the event, swimwear company Speedo said that it would no longer be sponsoring Rylov.\u201cFollowing his attendance at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow at the weekend, Speedo can confirm that it has terminated the sponsorship of Evgeny Rylov with immediate effect,\u201d the company said in a statement to Inside The Games.Elsewhere, world swimming governing body FINA said it was \u201cinvestigating\u201d Rylov\u2019s appearance at Luzhniki. \u00a0\u201cFINA is deeply disappointed to note the reports regarding Evgeny Rylov\u2019s appearance at the Luzhniki Stadium during Friday\u2019s rally,\u201d a spokesman said.\u00a0Unlike some federations, FINA has not issued a blanket ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes and is allowing them to compete as neutrals.Other notable Russian sporting figures to attend the Luzhniki concert included rhythmic gymnastics stars Dina and Arina Averina,\u00a0ice dancers Nikita Katsalapov and Victoria Sinitsina, and cross-country skier Alexander Bolshunov, who won three gold medals at the Beijing Winter Games last month.In a statement to Russia\u2019s Match TV, skiing federation the FIS said it was not currently planning personal sanctions against Bolshunov.Swim star Rylov emerged as one of Russia\u2019s biggest heroes at last summer\u2019s Tokyo Summer Olympics, winning three medals in total.He made broader headlines when US rival and defending Olympic champion Ryan Murphy \u2013 whom Rylov beat to gold in both the 100m and 200m events \u2013 suggested that the race was \u201cprobably not clean\u201d due to the participation of Russians and past allegations of doping.Murphy subsequently clarified that he was not directing the claims at anyone in particular.\u201cHe wrote me a private message on Instagram, said sorry for the misunderstanding that happened at the press conference...

","content":"\"The NYT piece on Hunter Biden's laptop comes as Joe Biden's presidency is mired in messes of his own making\", says Wall Street analyst and investigative journalist Charles Ortel. \"Decisions early on to attack fossil fuel production while spending trillions more dollars on fantasy programmes have fuelled historically high inflation rates that threaten a vast majority of Americans who have little savings, mounting debts, and live paycheck to paycheck. Abroad, American errors in foreign policies have been compounded by the arrogant, insolent incompetence of Biden, Harris, and their Cabinet who botched the withdrawal from Afghanistan, opened up our now violent southern border and incite mayhem at many flashpoints, especially in Ukraine now and perhaps soon over Taiwan\". It seems the NYT has finally had enough and now will be amenable to housecleaning well before the looming midterm elections this November, according to the Wall Street analyst. The NYT's latest article about Hunter, titled \"Hunter Biden Paid Tax Bill, But Broad Federal Investigation Continues\", was penned by Katie Benner, Kenneth P. Vogel, and Michael S. Schmidt. On 31 January 2022, Politico revealed that the NYT had sued the State Department under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to obtain emails that were sent or received by officials at the US Embassy in Romania between 2015 and 2019 mentioning Hunter Biden. The lawsuit stems from a 2019 report by the newspaper concerning Hunter's dealings with a Romanian real estate tycoon facing corruption charges, who \"hired\" the then-vice president's son in 2015. According to Politico, the NYT's inquiry into Hunter was spearheaded by investigative journalist Kenneth P. Vogel, who had been at odds with Team Biden throughout 2020. It did not prevent the NYT from attacking the New York Post's inquiry into Hunter's laptop shortly before the 2020 presidential election. At that time, the US legacy media denounced the New York Post story as \"Russian disinformation\". Yet, judging from the January 2022 FOIA, the NYT's 16 March piece is just one of a potential series of reports concerning the president's son. The Wall Street analyst does not rule out that the NYT reporting could be part of an internal political struggle within the Democratic Party. According to him, the NYT harbours ardent supporters of Bernie Sanders and of Hillary Clinton who are seen by some Democrats as more effective than Joe Biden. Furthermore, both Republican and Democratic insiders have been recently speculating about Hillary Clinton possibly running in the 2024 elections, even though she has denied this so far. American observers refer to the revival of the Clinton Global Initiative, which used to be active when the Clintons' participated in politics. The Wall Street analyst believes that Americans who think for themselves are \"thirsty for profound change in a system that encourages criminal behaviour in the political overclass who seem sure they are above all laws\". \"Let us hope the focus finally widens beyond Hunter and Joe Biden to the Clinton and Bush families, among others, that somehow have become much richer in the guise of public 'service' and in false-front philanthropy\", Ortel notes. Meanwhile, Fox News has drawn attention to the NYT's Hunter Biden story being completely ignored by the established media in the country, including CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and NBC. \"It was once routine that damning reports about the president published by The New York Times would lead nearly every news programme\", Fox News wrote on 18 March. \"That is no longer the case, at least under President Biden\u2026 Since Wednesday evening, the Times' report has received zero attention on the five major networks\".

Therefore, everything must be done to expedite the obtaining of the necessary permits,\" Jean-Francois Carenco, the chairman of the Energy Regulatory Commission, told the media. Carenco added that the goal is to have additional LNG receiving capacity brought on line within a year. According to the media, the project for the construction of a floating terminal in the port of Le Havre is being prepared by the French Ministry of Environmental Transformation, energy companies TotalEnergies, GRTGaz, and port structures connecting Le Havre, Rouen and Paris, has not yet been finalized. The floating terminal can import 50 terawatt hours (TWh) of gas per year or 3.9 million tonnes of LNG. It will be able to receive liquefied gas from the United States, Qatar or Africa. Natural gas prices were surging on the European market late last year, spurred by growing energy demand amid an economic recovery after months of lockdowns, as well as a limited supply. This has prompted the EU authorities to reinforce efforts toward ensuring the bloc's energy security, the need for which has become even more pressing during the conflict with Russia, the EU's main energy supplier, over the latter's military operation in Ukraine. Amid crippling global energy shortages, prices spiked further on Wednesday with gas futures topping $1,400 after Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed national energy giant Gazprom to change existing gas contracts into rubles. On 24 February, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Kiev forces. In response to Russia's operation, Western countries have rolled out a comprehensive sanctions campaign against Moscow.

It has left many communities and people feeling isolated and looking inward. I believe this has exacerbated the polarization and extremist behavior we are seeing across society today.\u201dWestern nations responded to the Ukraine crisis by launching an \u201ceconomic war\u201d against Moscow, including the unprecedented step of barring the Russian central bank from deploying its foreign currency reserves, Fink noted. Capital markets, financial institutions and other businesses have gone beyond the sanctions imposed by their governments, cutting off their Russian ties and operations.\u201cRussia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and its subsequent decoupling from the global economy is going to prompt companies and governments worldwide to re-evaluate their dependencies and re-analyze their manufacturing and assembly footprints \u2013 something that Covid had already spurred many to start doing,\u201d Fink said. As a result, he added, companies will move more operations to their home countries or to neighboring nations, leading to higher costs and prices.The Russia-Ukraine conflict has \u201cupended the world order\u201d that has been in place since the Cold War ended and will require BlackRock to adjust to \u201clong-term structural changes,\u201d such as deglobalization and higher inflation, Fink said. He added that central banks will have to either accept increased inflation \u2013 even beyond the 40-year high that was set last month in the US \u2013 or reduced economic activity and employment.New York-based BlackRock handles $10 trillion in assets, making it the world\u2019s largest\u00a0money manager, so Fink\u2019s views are closely watched by investors. In fact, the billionaire wields so much financial clout that his thoughts can be self-fulfilling, to some degree. Among other implications, he said he sees the Ukraine crisis accelerating the development of digital currencies and speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.\u201cThe ramifications of this war are not limited to Eastern Europe,\u201d Fink said. \u201cThey are layered on top of a pandemic that has already had profound effects on political, economic and social trends. The impact will reverberate for decades to come in ways we can\u2019t yet predict.\u201dAlthough Fink and Russian leaders don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on the Ukraine conflict \u2013 the money manager blames Moscow for causing the crisis \u2013 they agree that the world order is changing. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that sanctions against Moscow mark the end of an era, portending an end to the West\u2019s \u201cglobal dominance\u201d both politically and economically. Ex-President Dmitry Medvedev echoed those comments this week, saying, \u201cThe unipolar world has come to an end.\u201d"},{"uuid":"01335236-0482-4e21-a832-f71bdc9b7188","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220322\/twitter-ablaze-as-swedish-dairy-manufacturer-pulls-back-fermented-milk-over-russian-associations-1094075063.html","title":"Twitter Ablaze as Swedish Dairy Manufacturer Pulls Back Fermented Milk Over 'Russian Associations'","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/102311\/76\/1023117660_0:0:3072:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_7b1a425630d80f8735e5394944cf9dd2.jpg?source-sid=rian_photo","subtitle":"Kefir, an innocuous fermented milk drink similar to thin yogurt associated with Russia, has fallen prey to the outbreak of anti-Russian sentiment following Moscow's military operation in Ukraine.","content":"The sour milk product kefir will be removed from Swedish stores for a while, as local manufacturer Arla deemed its packaging featuring trademark onion domes reminiscent of the world-known Saint Basil's Cathedral unsuitable and inappropriate in the current circumstances, citing Russia's special operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine, which the West portrays as an \u201cinvasion\u201d.

Both countries have, so far, abstained from condemning and sanctioning Russia for its actions, maintaining trade relations with the country despite pressure from the West.While the two nations have called on Russia to cease hostilities and look for a diplomatic solution, India continues to buy Russian oil and is currently discussing means to switch to a rupee-rouble trade mechanism, allowing the two sides to avoid trading in the euro or the dollar.\u00a0China has repeatedly denounced unilateral sanctions on Moscow, protesting against Russia\u2019s exclusion from the G20.The relations between China and India began to deteriorate after a clash in the Ladakh region on their Himalayan border in June 2020, where at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed.\"Few would have anticipated ... the turn that India\u2019s relations with China have taken in the last two years,\" Indian Foreign Minister said on Thursday, stressing the importance of coordination on defense and foreign policies matters between the two countries. It is likely that India will push for complete disengagement of troops from the region during the Friday talks.The Chinese foreign minister visited Pakistan and Afghanistan earlier this week, and is set to continue his tour across South Asia by traveling to Nepal. In Pakistan, Wang Yi said\u00a0that \u201cChina shares the same hope\u201d as its Islamic colleagues regarding the status of Indian Kashmir province, who advocate for the province\u2019s \"inalienable right to self-determination\". The remark drew anger from some Indian officials ahead of his visit, as the Muslim majority region, controlled by both India and Pakistan, is considered a disputed territory, where India has been fighting armed rebels for decades."},{"uuid":"02f26b0e-c67b-4655-8944-2439177f4662","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552875-kiev-blasts-red-cross\/","title":"Ukraine accuses Red Cross of 'working for enemy'","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6242bd8920302732015ebe88.jpg","subtitle":"Deputy prime minister accuses international aid organization of helping Russia","content":"Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister has accused the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) of \u201cworking for the enemy\u201d after it allegedly assisted in the evacuation of residents from the city of Mariupol to Russia. She implied that the international aid organization was more interested in Russian money than in supporting the Ukrainian cause.The barrage of accusations came from Iryna Vereshchuk, who is Ukraine\u2019s highest-ranking parliamentarian with responsibility for humanitarian affairs. She reiterated Kiev\u2019s claims that Moscow was forcefully abducting Ukrainians from Mariupol, the port city that has seen some of the worst fighting since the month-long Russian attack on Ukraine began. The ICRC had helped with those evacuations, she has alleged.\u201cUkraine never agreed to a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol to Russia. That\u2019s obvious. They are occupiers. They are enemies. Not peacemakers. The Red Cross had no right to help evacuate people there,\u201d she said in an interview with Ukraine\u2019s Strana news outlet.The ICRC has denied it has ever participated in forced evacuations, either in Ukraine or anywhere else in the world, and stressed that, as a neutral humanitarian organization, its aim was to provide relief, rather than to take one side or the other in a conflict.We never help organize or carry out forced evacuations. This is true in Ukraine. This is true for everywhere we work around the world. We would not support any operation that goes against people\u2019s will.It said it had assisted with westward evacuations from the city of Sumy, but added that its ability to help people in Ukraine was being impacted by the continued failure of the combatants to guarantee the safe passage of humanitarian convoys.Vereshchuk has alleged that, contrary to its mission, the ICRC was \u201cde facto working on the side of the enemy\u201d and that it had been financially motivated to do so. \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t stink,\u201d she remarked, using the words the Roman emperor Vespasian said to his son to explain why taxing even urine was a good policy.\u201cThat is not my suspicion \u2013 I know it for sure. Nobody hid the fact that the Red Cross received donations from Russia,\u201d Vereshchuk added.The ICRC receives funding through voluntary donations, with over 80% of them coming from donor states that are party to the Geneva Conventions. The organization says it \u201conly accepts funds from those who respect the ICRC\u2019s independence and impartiality of action.\u201d\u00a0Critics argue it is a key foreign policy institution of its host country, Switzerland, which can hardly be considered as taking Russia\u2019s side in the Ukraine crisis.Vereshchuk has declared that the ICRC has \u201cdiscredited itself\u201d in the eyes of Kiev to the point of requiring institutional change. The agency had proved to be \u201ctoothless\u201d and \u201cimpotent\u201d in Ukraine, she said. She made it clear that her criticism did not extend to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, however, which, she admitted, had \u201cstarted receiving hate\u201d amid Kiev\u2019s attacks on the ICRC.The Ukrainian government had earlier demanded that the ICRC not open an office in Rostov-on-Don, the largest Russian city on Ukraine\u2019s eastern border, in response to an influx of refugees. Kiev claimed such a move would \u201clegitimize\u201d Russian \u201cabductions\u201d of Ukrainians \u2013 that is, evacuations to which Kiev had not given its permission.Moscow has denied having forced Ukrainians to flee from hostilities to its territory, and has accused Kiev of trying to use its own civilians as a human shield.The ICRC has reiterated that its priority is \u201cto reach victims of armed conflict, wherever they are, in order to assist them.\u201d"},{"uuid":"03537838-3ce4-48fd-83db-25d52fbb1ea1","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220323\/the-white-house-is-willing-to-discuss-nuclear-weapons-1094099014.html","title":"The White House is Willing to Discuss Nuclear Weapons","image":null,"subtitle":"On today\u2019s episode of The Backstory, host Rachel Blevins discussed current events including a 6.9 Earthquake that struck the coast of Taiwan, and 250 Truckers protesting high gas prices in Hamburg, Germany.","content":"GUEST Michael Maloof - Former Senior Security Policy Analyst | Biden Mentions Chemical Weapons, President Biden's Desperation, and Democrats Owning Russiagate David Tawil - Founder of ProChain Capital | EU Reliant on Russian Oil, Crypto Mining in Russia, and Germany's Energy Crisis In the first hour, Rachel spoke with Michael Maloof about urban warfare, false flags, and Russia's military operation ending soon.

The Government Information Cell (GIC) is operated between the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office, the first such unit since the end of the Cold War. The social media platform mentioned in the article has refuted reports that it showed British government ads.\u00a0\u00a0The unit\u2019s \u201ccrucial audiences\u201d are in Russia and Ukraine, the article highlights. After Moscow blocked Twitter and Facebook, the Telegraph reports, the GIC has turned to advertising agencies to \u201ctarget\u201d Russian users on sites such as VK, the country\u2019s most popular domestic social media platform. The tech firm's press service has already refuted the claim, telling Russian news site RBC that \u201call ads go through verification and have to follow VK\u2019s and Russia\u2019s law.\u201d The website rules in any case prohibit political ads.The tactic is described as reaching the devices of people \u201cwho would never have thought to seek out the view of the British Government.\u201d Some 35 full-time staff were reportedly pulled from numerous departments, including the Foreign Office, Home Office, Ministry of Defence, Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, and the Cabinet Office.\u00a0Britain\u2019s Foreign Secretary Liz Truss revealed the unit\u2019s creation in late February, days before Moscow attacked its neighbor. Back then she outlined in an interview with the Mail that the unit\u2019s task is to expose and fight \u201cfalse information.\u201d Details of how the unit is countering supposed\u00a0\u201cKremlin disinformation\u201d were given in the Telegraph\u2019s report.The unit identifies so-called \u201cRussian disinformation,\u201d\u00a0brands it as false and then creates \u201cnew content\u201d to be spread online. It also apparently distributes reports to NATO and EU members, along with Australia and New Zealand. The unit further coordinates with embassies abroad to translate content around the world.\u00a0The article gave an example of the sort of content the unit disseminates. One of the videos from late February involves Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressing Russians in their own language\u00a0saying that \u201cI do not believe this war is in your name.\u201d The unit claims that more than eight million people viewed this video, according to the Telegraph. VK\u2019s audience is nearly 79.3 million as of October 2021.An unnamed person dubbed an \u201cally of Ms Truss\u201d \u00a0told the newspaper that the Foreign Secretary believed that \u201cditching our Cold War anti-propaganda capability was a mistake,\u201d and that this unit is a restoration of that.In 1948 during the Cold War-era Foreign Office had a covert unit called the Information Research Department (IRD) created to spread anti-Soviet and anti-communist views. It was disbanded in 1977 by then-Foreign Secretary David Owen. The IRD is thought to have operated alongside MI6 and the BBC\u2019s World Service. Among other controversial dimensions, according to declassified documents, the British propaganda campaign incited the mass slaughter of communists in Indonesia in the 1960s. The unit was also involved in undermining the Irish Republican Army\u00a0during the war\u00a0in Northern Ireland and in countering the \u2018Black Power\u2019 movement in the Caribbean."},{"uuid":"03e03f0a-9d5b-4ea0-b41c-01ca5092fc54","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552752-ukraine-uk-west-sanctions\/","title":"West will 'pay a price' for Russia clampdown \u2013 ex-army chief","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623f09bb2030274a5c4d8dd8.jpg","subtitle":"The West\u2019s populations must be ready for years of \u201chardship,\u201d a UK general has said","content":"Western nations should prepare their peoples for a long-term drop in living standards if their standoff with Russia continues, the Britain\u2019s former Assistant Chief of Defence Staff, Jonathan Shaw, has said.\u201cWe in the West have the wrong mentality\u201d about the conflict in Ukraine, he said. Once one of the British Army\u2019s most senior officers, Shaw was speaking on talk radio station LBC on Saturday.\u201cWe are obsessed with humanitarian concerns and individual suffering, and that makes good TV, but the reality is this is far more serious than that,\u201d the Major-General, whose 30-year career spanned the Falklands and Kosovo to commanding the UK forces in Iraq in 2006, warned.The West has imposed draconian sanctions on Russia after it attacked Ukraine a month ago. This includes the US and Canada giving up their need for supplies of Russian hydrocarbon fuels, and the EU and UK announcing plans to join them in the near future.The restrictions and retaliatory steps by Moscow have already seen energy and food prices spiking in many Western nations. There were reports of British food-bank users refusing free potatoes because they couldn\u2019t afford to boil them. But Shaw predicted that this is only the beginning.\u201cWe\u2019ve now decided that as far as Russia\u2019s concerned we\u2019re going to play geopolitics ahead of economics and we\u2019ve to pay a price for that,\u201d he explained.And, according to the Major-General, governments in the UK and elsewhere aren\u2019t doing enough to ready their citizenry \u201cfor that sort of hardship and that attitude.\u201d \u201cWe need to be psychologically preparing our people for a long-term degradation of standard of living and a long-term confrontation with Russia,\u201d he argued.\u201cOur quality of life back home absolutely depends on them \u2013 cheap fuel, cheap access, doing deals with Saudi Arabia, and things like that,\u201d Shaw pointed out.Russia sent troops to Ukraine in late February following a seven-year standoff over Kiev\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the breakaway Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO.

Along with this, vaccine administration for the uninsured will also end in a few weeks.\u00a0Since the Covid-19 pandemic is far from over and has been particularly bad in the United States already, the results of this will be disastrous.\u00a0On March 15, the White House released a fact sheet warning about the implications of this funding deficit.\u00a0Among the key issues were the fact that it would be harder to identify emerging variants, scaling back of planned purchases of preventative treatments, and damage to global vaccination and treatment efforts.\u00a0As one of the few developed countries in the world that does not have universal health care, this essentially means that coverage for Covid-19, during an ongoing pandemic that has killed nearly 1 million Americans already, will be rationed based on wealth.\u00a0Starting March 28, hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices won\u2019t be reimbursed by the federal government for testing or treating uninsured patients for Covid-19. This means patients will be turned away if they don\u2019t have the money in most cases unless providers decide to treat them for free or at a discount. In early April, the same will apply to those seeking vaccination.\u00a0Some states will retain an emergency Medicaid option that would allow free Covid-19 testing and treatment for the uninsured. However, the problem is that less than half of US states opted into the program \u2013 and most of the states not signed on happen to also mostly be poorer ones.\u00a0Prior to this funding disaster, the federal government had essentially been declaring victory on the pandemic. The CDC lifted its mask and other guidelines and also changed its definition of what high transmission means, which now reflects the degree to which Covid-19 outbreaks are straining hospital systems \u2013 not actual community transmission.\u00a0Likewise, the administration had been saying that the situation on the ground was changing because Covid-19 was no longer as deadly given the myriad treatment options and available vaccinations. Lack of access to these treatments immediately changes this calculus, making low household income another \u2018at risk\u2019 factor for the coronavirus.\u00a0This is, of course, an outcome Americans are famously used to. According to one highly cited study by the National Library of Medicine from 2008 during that era\u2019s health care policy debate, about 26,000 Americans die every year from lack of health insurance. Another one in 2009 by the American Journal of Public Health found that this figure was about 45,000.\u00a0Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA, often called ObamaCare) may have reduced these preventable deaths, but federal aid being pulled during the worst public health emergency in a century will see this number increase. There is zero doubt.\u00a0So why isn\u2019t anyone doing anything about this? As tends to be the case, the answer is Congress. On March 2, the White House asked Congress for another $22.5 billion\u00a0in funding for testing, vaccines, and treatments \u2013 but it has failed to pass anything on this issue even though there have been a few attempts. It seems Congress is happy to just pretend the pandemic is over and get on with life.\u00a0What\u2019s also ironic about the White House\u2019s funding request is that it also included a funding request for aid to Ukraine. The deadlocked Senate, which is split 50-50 for both parties and can\u2019t even agree to reduce childhood poverty, the next week passed a $1.5 trillion government funding package that included \u00a0$13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine \u2013 but nixed a reduced $15 billion in Covid-19 relief for Americans.\u00a0Note that this aid to Ukraine is split into \u2018humanitarian\u2019 and \u2018lethal\u2019. In addition to some $3 billion of this being spent on direct funding to the US military\u2019s European Command, it will see an additional $3 billion allocated toward providing weapons to Ukraine and other US allies in Europe.\u00a0Arms lobbyists and their underlings in Congress and the Pentagon are scrambling now to unlock more funds for the military-industrial complex to pump out weapons to Europe, as Politico reported on March 22, including guaranteed contracts and a potential invocation of the Defense Production Act.\u00a0Likewise, the Pentagon is expected to roll out its budget proposal in the coming days which will list a few priorities,\u00a0including hypersonic missiles, to reach parity with Russia after\u00a0Russia\u2019s self-reported usage of its Kinzhal hypersonic missile system in Ukraine. The cost to research, develop, test, and then fast-track this weapon system would be immense but is already being teed up in Congress.\u00a0This funding dilemma says a lot about Washington. Nearly 1,000 Americans are still dying from Covid-19 every day and the country\u2019s combined death toll is nearing 1 million \u2013 but Congress doesn\u2019t want to fund treatment and testing anymore. But when it comes to funneling weapons to Ukraine and developing weapon delivery systems for its great power rivalry with Russia, well, Congress has it covered and then some.\u00a0"},{"uuid":"051f4228-7478-404b-8fcb-d3ff90cfbb6e","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220320\/japan-wants-india-to-cooperate-further-on-ukraine-crisis-announces-42-billion-in-investments-1094023043.html","title":"Japan Wants India to 'Cooperate Further' on Ukraine Crisis, Announces $42 Billion in Investments","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/105263\/21\/1052632174_0:0:3076:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_7114b9234439345044cbecbd5a3f33b0.jpg?source-sid=rian_photo","subtitle":"Japan has imposed economic sanctions against more than 70 Russian individuals, banks, and other entities over Moscow's military operation in Ukraine.

Ono further said that both nations would \"jointly support\" Ukraine and its neighbouring nations in tackling the \"humanitarian crisis\" caused by the fighting in Ukraine. \"They emphasised that the contemporary global order has been built on the UN Charter, international law, and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of states\", the joint statement added. The joint announcement comes against the backdrop of firing incidents at the Zaporozhye nuclear facility in Ukraine, with the Russian Defence Ministry this month accusing Ukrainian fighters of creating a provocation at the installation. The Russian Defence Ministry has also accused Ukrainian \"neo-Nazi battalions\" of planning to blow up a nuclear reactor near Kharkov and blame Moscow for it. \"The fact that humanitarian assistance is an element that both our countries believe in, and we are all also engaged in that\", Shringla told reporters. During their joint appearance at Delhi's Hyderabad House after the meeting, Modi didn't make any direct reference to Ukraine in his press statement. Kishida, on the other hand, mentioned the security crisis there. A significant outcome of the meeting was Japan's pledge to enhance its investments in India over the next five years. During his press briefing, Shringla said that the investment was a \"sign of the level of cooperation in the economic domain that the two countries enjoy\". Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Zelensky\u2019s earlier statement accusing  Russia's forces of targeting Uman - a site visited by pilgrims from Israel - is a \"cynical lie,\" Konashenkov said. The synagogue in Uman, according to the Russian MoD, is being used by the Kiev nationalist regime for military purposes, so that any attack on it could be used to provoke a conflict, making Russia the target of political pressure from Jewish religious organizations, added the general. On 20 March, Ukraine's  President Volodymyr Zelensky, addressing the Israeli Knesset via Zoom, accused Russia of allegedly launching missile strikes at the city of Uman, Cherkasy region.  For further dramatic effect, Zelensky had stated that Russian forces were purportedly targeting a place \u201cwhere tens of thousands of Israelis come each year to visit the grave of Rabbi Nachman.\u201d The Ukrainian leader also said that Israel \"will have to live\" with its decisions to withhold military aid from Kiev. Israel has refrained from joining Western sanctions against Russia and not agreed to provide Kiev with military equipment. According to evidence presented by the Russian Defense Ministry on Wednesday, weapons and ammunition stored in the synagogue building in Uman had been loaded by the nationalists into dump trucks and then disguised as bags of construction debris.  Furthermore, photographic evidence showed that nationalist units and foreign mercenaries from the western regions of Ukraine were being transported on vehicles disguised as school buses, with the sign \"Children\" painted on them, said the MoD.

British and French officials have distanced themselves from Biden's controversial statements, with French President Emmanuel Macron warning the US against the use of inflammatory language in an already tense situation. This wasn't the only aggressively hostile remark concerning Vladimir Putin and Russia muttered by the American commander-in-chief: earlier he called his Russian counterpart a \"war criminal\" and a \"butcher.\" The Kremlin made it clear that the US president's claims are \"absolutely inadmissible and inexcusable.\" However, Rasmussen does not rule out that it was not just a \"gaffe\": \"There may be a desire to test the reaction within Europe; to send a signal or threat to Russia; to influence the Russian public,\" he suggests. \"When I heard such outlandish remarks it brought back memories of the \u201cAssad must Go\u201d campaign in Syria. Yes, the US foreign policy team was much the same.\" The Biden administration is not pushing forward with any diplomatic solution and is not trying to de-escalate the situation, the observers point out. Instead, Washington is not only resorting to aggressive rhetoric but is also flooding Ukraine with weapons, according to them. While delivering his speech in Warsaw last Saturday the US president vowed to send more lethal arms to Ukraine, stressing that \"this battle will not be won in days, or months either.\" Moscow appears to be fully aware of the plans and desires of Joe Biden and his team, according to Rasmussen. Before launching the special operation to de-militarise and de-Nazify Ukraine under Article 51 of the UN Charter, the Russian leadership asked the West in mid-December 2021 to provide legal guarantees of NATO's non-expansion eastward and Ukraine's non-admission to NATO, among other issues. However, the US, NATO and the EU rejected Moscow's key proposals. Right now the US foreign policy team is \"panicking and extremely frustrated,\" Rasmussen says. According to the scholar, extensive censorship in Europe and in the US is caused by the fact that Western governments do not control the situation. He believes that their policies, including the bans on Russian energy, have been hasty and ill-thought-out amid galloping post-COVID inflation and soaring prices. The EU has become the biggest loser as a consequence of this policy, according to the observers. Having backed themselves into a corner, Western governments \"may do something even worse such as a 'false flag' or intervention,\" he warns. \"Such actions would rapidly see an escalation of the conflict and easily could pull Europe in completely,\" remarks the scholar. Biden is clearly trying to use Russia as a bogeyman to divert the American public's attention from snowballing domestic problems, according to Rasmussen. \"Yet, while President Putin\u2019s approval ratings are rising, President Biden\u2019s seems to be continuing to fall,\" the scholar remarks. Biden's approval rating has plummeted to 40%, as the latest Reuters poll has found. At the same time, according to the latest NBC News survey, 7 in 10 Americans expressed low confidence in President Joe Biden\u2019s ability to deal with Russia's special operation in Ukraine. Moreover, many US residents are starting to feel the pain of the sanctions against Russia, says Rick Sterling. What's more, this situation will only get worse since \"Russia is a vital component not just for markets but in the global supply chain impacting almost every element that touches our lives,\" according to Rasmussen. \"The Washington elite in their [effort] to protect borders halfway around the world and a democracy that they themselves destroyed in a coup in 2014 seem to have missed assessing the impact of their insane actions,\" he says. \"Let\u2019s hope they do not continue us down such a dangerous path. Unfortunately, my eternal optimism is fading.\" "},{"uuid":"0630cb82-e5ef-4f8b-ab35-f1ba52a6a936","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/sport\/552998-uk-sanctions-russian-athletes-medvedev-chelsea\/","title":"UK wants athletes to sign form promising Putin does not back them","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/62448e902030276af822f9c5.jpg","subtitle":"The country's Sports Minister also wants stars to sign a written promise that they will not publicly support Russia, Belarus or Vladimir Putin and are 'genuinely neutral'","content":"Nigel Huddleston, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's top sports chief, has revealed plans to ask athletes to sign a form promising that they will not make supportive comments about Russia or Belarus and are not \"receiving money\" from Russian President Vladimir Putin.The UK Sports Minister said he had a \"good meeting\" with sporting governing bodies about \"sanctions and bans\" for individual athletes following plans the Conservative politician initially outlined earlier this month in response to the start of the attack on Ukraine on February 24.When he was specifically asked about Daniil Medvedev \u2013 arguably Russia's most prominent active athlete, who is vying with Novak Djokovic to be world number one \u2013 Huddleston said at the time that the government had entered\u00a0talks with the organizers of London Grand Slam tournament Wimbledon over entry requirements for Russian players.\"We\u00a0did make the request to governing bodies relating to individual sports people that if [Russians or Belarussians] wish to participate in a UK sport, they are independent and neutral \u2013 and genuinely so,\" he\u00a0said in his update.\u201cWe wish to get the assurance, in a written declaration, that they are not receiving money from Putin, Russia or Belarus [and] that they will not be making supportive comments of Putin, Russia or Belarus.\"If people are saying they are neutral athletes, we want the assurance that they are genuinely neutral and therefore there isn\u2019t any connection with Putin.\u201cWe are requesting governing bodies or individual events seek that assurance in advance if they are going to allow neutrals to play.\"The International Tennis Federation (ITF) is one of a dwindling number of major sporting organizations not to have followed the International Olympic Committee's advice to exile Russian and Belaurisan athletes.Tennis players from the two nations\u00a0have continued to compete as neutrals in the wake of the conflict but have been ordered to appear without national symbols.Reigning US Open champion Medvedev has removed the Russian flag from his social media accounts and said he would accept any decisions imposed by sporting federations or other authorities while calling for peace.Notable events on the British sporting calendar could follow the lead of Motorsport UK, the organizers of the Formula One Grand Prix at Silverstone.The body said it would not allow competitors from the countries to participate.

Under the contract for 2020-24, Gazprom ships 40 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year through the Ukrainian transit infrastructure. Last year, the transit amounted to 41.66 billion cubic meters. According to earlier reports, Gazprom pays Ukraine roughly $2 billion per year for its transit services.According to Vitrenko, Russian companies that are not subject to restrictions can use their accounts in the West despite the sanctions, can receive money from oil and gas sales, and pay Ukraine for transit. The Naftogaz CEO called on Europe and its allies to put Moscow\u2019s revenues for energy flows in an escrow account until the Russian troops withdraw.The EU has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia to try to cut off the cash flow to the government and force it to abandon its military operation in Ukraine. The bloc also pledged to reduce its dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year and to wean itself off completely before 2030.Since the start of Russia\u2019s military operation in Ukraine, gas flows to Europe soared to the highest level since December, according to Bloomberg. Ukraine\u2019s gas transit network operator reported a 20% daily increase in capacity bookings during the period, and Gazprom confirmed that supplies increased due to more orders from European customers. In the first two weeks of March, Gazprom\u2019s deliveries to Europe were at the highest level since last August.The increase in imports from Russia \u2013 which is the second largest producer of natural gas globally \u2013 reflects the lack of options Europe has in the short-term to meet natural gas demand, JPMorgan Chase said in a report last week.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"},{"uuid":"05721398-4483-4c2d-94f8-acaad039d19a","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552585-ukraine-nazi-germany-post\/","title":"Ukraine compares its struggles to Nazi Germany","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623b85ae85f5404780152321.jpg","subtitle":"The Ukrainian parliament has equated its present situation  with those of the war-time Third Reich","content":"Ukraine\u2019s parliament on Wednesday appealed again to the West to impose a \u201cno-fly zone\u201d over the country. However, the institution raised eyebrows online by comparing the devastation suffered by its cities to that endured\u00a0by Nazi Germany during Allied bombing raids, in World War Two.The bizarre choice of comparison is the latest Nazi-related statement to come out of Kiev.The image posted to Twitter by the account of the\u00a0\u2018Verkhovna Rada\u2019 (Parliament) portrays a bombed out building in Hamburg in 1943 alongside similar damage to the Ukrainian city of Kharkov in 2022.The text above the image reads \u201cWhen the Sky is Open,\u201d and a message in English demands that the West \u201c#CloseTheSky over Ukraine.\u201d\u201cClose The Sky\u201d is a reference to the possibility of a NATO-imposed \u2018no-fly zone\u2019 over Ukraine, a step Kiev has demanded but leaders in Washington and Brussels have thus far refused to take. It would involve NATO committing to shooting down Russian aircraft over Ukraine, a step that would bring the bloc\u00a0into open combat with Russia and, in the words of US President Joe Biden, lead to \u201ca third world war.\u201dBizarrely, the image shared by the parliament asks the same allies that bombed Hamburg in 1943 to fight on Ukraine\u2019s behalf today. The Rada did not explain why it chose to compare Kharkov with Hamburg, especially considering the fact that Kharkov itself was bombed by Germany during the Second World War, which would have made for a comparison that wouldn\u2019t involve comparing Ukraine with Nazi Germany.The analogy drew some puzzled comments online. \u201cYou aren't supposed to compare yourselves to Nazis in public,\u201d one commenter joked. \u201cMan, they really don\u2019t know what optics are,\u201d another quipped.Russian President Vladimir Putin has long accused Ukrainian elites\u00a0of harboring sympathies for Nazi Germany, and in a speech announcing the start of Russia\u2019s military offensive on Ukraine last month, he said that one of Russia\u2019s goals was to \u201cdenazify\u201d the country.Aside from integrating the neo-Nazi \u2018Azov\u2019 batallion into its military, Kiev authorities\u00a0have launched efforts to portray its people as racially distinct from Russians, whom local politicians have openly referred to as \u201corcs.\u201dNazi collaborator Stepan Bandera is considered a hero to Ukrainian nationalists, and just last week a television host in Ukraine, Fahruddin Sharafmal, caused controversy when he approvingly quoted Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in calling for the murder of Russians and their children."},{"uuid":"0787665a-7a09-440f-ae1c-918e34ad0b31","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552496-ukraine-hungary-russia-criticism\/","title":"Ukraine accuses Hungary of having designs on its land","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623a10c82030274e21320f14.jpg","subtitle":"Deputy PM alleges that \u201ccheap Russian gas\u201d and a thirst for territory could be behind Budapest\u2019s \u201cpro-Russian\u201d rhetoric","content":"Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk has questioned, what she has described as, Hungary\u2019s \u201cpro-Russian\u201d rhetoric, suggesting that the desire for \u201ccheap Russian gas\u201d or even a potential land grab could be behind Budapest\u2019s policy over the conflict between Moscow and Kiev.In a lengthy Facebook post, the official claimed that \u201cnot even all Russian satellites from the former Soviet Union behave the way Hungary\u2019s authorities do.\u201d She said that Hungary does not support sanctions against Russia, refuses to provide Ukraine with weapons, and even \u201cdoes not allow weapons from other countries to pass via their territory.\u201d\u201cIn fact, they say \u2018no\u2019 to everything.

Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

He also urged the Jewish state to take action, impose sanctions on Russia, and provide his country with advanced equipment and technology.","content":"On Sunday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a speech to Israeli MPs after addressing lawmakers in the US, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Initially, the plan was that Zelensky would address Israeli politicians from the stage of the Knesset in Jerusalem. But the idea was eventually scrapped with the excuse that the plenum was on a scheduled break. Instead, he was offered to speak to lawmakers via Zoom, while the parliamentarians were given the option to not attend his address. Some seized on the opportunity and skipped the event. But the majority listened in, along with more than a thousand ordinary Israelis who gathered on Tel Aviv's Habima Square to watch the address live. In his speech, the Ukrainian president was trying to speak to the hearts of the masses. He compared the actions of the Russians currently carrying out a special military operation in Ukraine to those of the Nazis. Zelensky claimed that Moscow was carrying out a \"final solution\" against the Ukrainians and urged Israel to help his people, just as the Ukrainians \"came to the rescue\" of the Jews some 80 years ago. By \"helping out\", Zelensky referred to a number of measures. He demanded that Israel provide Ukraine with its Iron Dome missile defence system. He called for severe sanctions to be introduced on Russia and urged for more Ukrainian refugees to be taken in. Zelensky\u2019s criticism was probably meant to evoke guilt among Israelis, but once the speech was over, it turned out that his remarks had quite an opposite effect. Israeli experts, politicians, and journalists have taken to social media platforms to vent their dissatisfaction with the speech, which slammed Israel on all possible fronts. Some said his Holocaust analogy was \"outrageous\". Others treated his criticism as sheer \"ungratefulness\", especially given the efforts Israel has been making to help the Ukrainian people. Since the Russian military operation kicked off on 24 February, Israel has absorbed more than 5,000 Ukrainian refugees, with many others still on their way. The country has also exerted efforts to mediate between Moscow and Kiev. It has poured in millions of dollars into setting up a makeshift hospital in the west of Ukraine, while Israeli NGOs have collected money, food, clothes, and medicine to assist the country. Ordinary Israelis did not appreciate Zelensky's criticism either, and too took to social media platforms to express their anger with the Ukrainian leader. However, comments about the Holocaust were far from the only issue that stirred anti-Zelensky sentiments, with many twitterians slamming the Ukrainian head of state for demanding that Israel neglect its national interests and take sides. Over the years, Israel and Russia have established stable trade relations and tight cooperation on a number of issues. Moscow, which protects the air space in Syria, clinched a deal with Tel Aviv on military coordination in Syria to prevent accidents following the 2018 downing of a Russian Il-20 plane off the Syrian coast during Israeli airstrikes on Latakia. Russia also helps mediate between Israel and the Palestinians, especially in the Gaza Strip Israel would not want to risk jeopardising those ties. It is also not ready to provide the Ukrainians with the equipment they are seeking to obtain. The harsh criticism of Zelensky appears to have done the trick. During the night, the Ukrainian president released a message where he thanked Israel for all its efforts. But as Russia's military operation continues, and Israel stays firm on maintaining its relative neutrality, another serving of harsh remarks might be just a matter of time.

The official pointed the finger at Poroshenko\u2019s decision to write NATO aspirations into the country\u2019s constitution.The clause, outlining Kiev\u2019s pathway to becoming a full-fledged member of the EU and US-led NATO alliance, was added into Ukraine's constitution in February 2019 and shortly before presidential elections. While the move was a pure PR stunt for the former president, it turned out to have long-lasting consequences, Arestovich told local media.\u201cWhen Poroshenko introduced this, it was his personal pre-election PR technology. He knew beforehand that NATO would never accept us. Not the least share of the blame for what is happening now in Ukraine lies with those who adopted and promoted this constitutional provision,\u201d he said, implying that those Ukrainian MPs who supported the clause share the blame for it as well. The constitutional change received overwhelming support back then with 334 out of 450 MPs voting for it.Under Poroshenko, the desire to join NATO was also incorporated into the country\u2019s military doctrine in 2015. That document also formally established Russia as a \u201cmilitary adversary\u201d of Kiev.Ukraine\u2019s NATO aspirations, however, actually date well before the February 2019 constitutional reform. The country was cozying up to the US-led bloc since the late 1990s, sending a \u201cpeacekeeping unit\u201d to Iraq in 2002, adopting legislation allowing military access of NATO forces onto its soil in 2004, and so on.The bloc itself formally recognized Ukraine\u2019s aspirations in 2008, when the alliance announced in the Bucharest Summit Declaration that it welcomed \u201cUkraine\u2019s and Georgia\u2019s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO.\u201d The summit participants agreed that eventually these countries would \u201cbecome members of NATO.\u201dMoscow attacked the neighboring state following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

So far, Beijing has only expressed support for ongoing talks between diplomats from Kiev and Moscow.","content":"The Biden administration unveiled new sanctions against Chinese officials on Monday, restricting the visas of those the White House claims are \"involved in repressive acts against members of ethnic and religious minority groups and religious and spiritual practitioners\" in China's western Xinjiang Autonomous Region \"and outside of China's borders, including within the United States.\" The minister did not elaborate on the precise nature of the allegations regarding the targeting of Uyghurs in the United States. However, since the Taliban* took over from the US-backed Afghan government in August 2021, Beijing has pressured Kabul to end its support for the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a terrorist group responsible for numerous attacks in China. Until 2020, the US also considered the ETIM a terrorist group, noting its ties to the Taliban and al-Qaeda**, but removed it from the list after claiming it no longer existed. Other Uyghur separatist groups, including the World Uyghur Congress and Uyghur Human Rights Project, have enjoyed extensive largesse from US groups like the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a group created in the 1980s to serve as a front for the CIA so as to disguise the flow of funds to groups useful to US foreign policy, as past heads of the NED have admitted. Beijing denies that a genocide is taking place in Xinjiang. The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) also denies accusations that it forcibly sterilizes Uyghur women or restricts Uyghur culture and the practice of Islam, suggesting instead  that its rehabilitation and training programs for former extremists are voluntary and in line with guidelines contained within the United Nations Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. The CCP additionally asserts that the Uyghur population has been voluntarily enrolled in vocational training centers a part of a deradicalization program aimed at eliminating support for groups like the ETIM. The new sanctions come as the Biden administration is trying to woo Beijing into breaking its alignment with Moscow, after the Kremlin initiated its special military operation Ukraine last month. US President Joe Biden told Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call on Friday that China would face sanctions if it sent military aid to Russia during the Ukraine special military operation. *The Taliban - a group under United Nations sanction for terrorist activities **Al-Qaeda - a terrorist group banned in Russia and many other countries "},{"uuid":"095ed91e-31ff-43aa-9e7f-c512ef0c7e3a","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220326\/scholars-us-dod-big-tech--big-media-will-try-to-mute-hunter-bidens-ukraine-bioweapon-labs-story-1094219489.html","title":"Scholars: US DOD, Big Tech & Big Media Will Try to Mute Hunter Biden's Ukraine Bioweapon Labs Story","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/102449\/95\/1024499564_0:0:2048:1375_1440x900_80_0_1_750cd5fb17040eb6937364abeb20a6b4.jpg?source-sid=afp","subtitle":"The Russian Ministry of Defence on 24 March presented new evidence that Ukraine was involved in bioweapons research, revealing that President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, funded the Pentagon's military biological programme in Ukraine via the investment fund Rosemont Seneca. Will the US media and justice machine step in to investigate the matter?","content":"\"US presidents seem to get away with a lot, as long as the so-called Military-Industrial-Counter-Intelligence-Media-Academia-Think Tank complex (MICIMATT) is behind them\", says Retired US Air Force Lt. Col. Karen Kwiatkowski, a former analyst for the US Department of Defence. \"The FBI Hunter Biden laptop cover-up lasted for over two years. If the Ukrainian biolabs are destroyed or cleaned up without incident, I expect this story will be memory-holed for longer than that\". The fact that the US was developing components of biological weapons in Ukraine has been largely ignored by international watchdogs, while Washington vehemently denied any involvement whatsoever in the programme, branding it a \"Russian conspiracy theory\". However, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland on 8 March told US senators that \"bioresearch facilities\" in Ukraine actually exist, while a 2010 BioPrepWatch article preserved in web archives and the US Armed Forces' Counterproliferation Centre confirmed that America had maintained bioresearch cooperation with Kiev since 2005. The Russian Ministry of Defence has held a number of presentations revealing the depth of the US bioweapons programme in Ukraine run by the Pentagon's Defence Threat Reduction Agency. At least 31 laboratories across 14 settlements are suspected of being involved in US-funded military biological activities. The Rosemont Seneca investment fund, co-founded by Hunter Biden, participated in the funding of Ukrainian biolabs in cooperation with Metabiota, a subcontractor to the Pentagon's principal contactor Black &amp; Veatch, according to the Russian MoD. Metabiota and Black &amp; Veatch are known as major supplies of equipment for Pentagon biolaboratories around the world, the MoD specifies. According to Kwiatkowski, major mainstream sources are likely to suppress the story as major US defence contractors are heavily investing in American mainstream media. The former Pentagon analyst notes that judging from surveys, 90% of US mainstream media personalities, reporters, and publishers are politically Democrats, which makes it almost impossible that they would attack the Democratic administration and key politicians. \"I think it will be suppressed and access to many overseas new organisations is already being blocked by Google, Facebook, and Twitter\", she says. Yet, the Daily Mail \u2013 a media outlet belonging to Australian-born US media mogul Rupert Murdoch \u2013 reported on 25 March that the Russian MoD's findings are \"at least partially true\". According to the media outlet, the emails from Hunter's laptop \"show he helped secure millions of dollars of funding\" for Metabiota, a Department of Defence contractor which worked in Ukraine, specialising in research on pandemic-causing diseases \"that could be used as bioweapons\". Per the media outlet, Hunter Biden and his business partners invested $500,000 in Metabiota through their firm Rosemont Seneca and raised several million dollars in funding for the company from investment giants including Goldman Sachs. The Daily Mail also quotes US government spending records indicating that the Pentagon awarded a $18.4 million contract to Metabiota between February 2014 and November 2016, with $307,091 earmarked for \"Ukraine research projects\". Former senior CIA officer Sam Faddis, cited by the Daily Mail, notes that even though the Pentagon insists that that there's nothing nefarious occurring in Ukraine and the biolabs are simply focused on pandemic early warning research, \"we don't know for sure that's all that was going on\". The Pentagon has good reason to conceal the truth as it could have potentially violated the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act (BWATA) of 1989, according to Francis Boyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law who drafted the law in question. Boyle expresses scepticism about the possibility of the Pentagon being held accountable. He recalled that he was the first one to blow the whistle that the anthrax attacks of October 2001 came out of the US Biological Warfare Weapons Lab and programme. \"I did that at a conference at Harvard Divinity School on November 1, 2001, and I gave a couple of interviews and an order was given\", he says. \"And I was never interviewed again by any Western news media source, and the United States government is still lying about the origins of that attack. And they've covered up and they've gotten away with it\". If the news becomes too annoying for the Pentagon and the US government they will find ways to divert public opinion with something \"more newsworthy\", according to Michael Springmann, former American diplomat and political analyst. Now Washington may try to shift the focus by calling for international peacekeepers to enter Ukraine, according to Springmann. \"That would divert attention and then paint the Russians again as aggressors who won't let poor, innocent peacekeepers into the country to ensure that Ukraine will do what the American government wants it to do\", he suggests. Meanwhile, one shouldn't delude oneself into believing that the United Nations \u2013 which has repeatedly declined to investigate the issue of the US-funded biolabs in Ukraine \u2013 would step forward and call for a new inquiry, according to the observers. \"The United Nations is under the control of the United States\", says Springmann. \"Its headquarters sits in New York City and the United States supplies a good chunk of the UN's budget, and it has a great control over its membership by promising aid or withholding aid or benefits or other things that might be useful to a foreign country\".

Vovan has confirmed that the platform blocked the channel, saying that YouTube cited a \"violation of community rules\". He also added a link to their clips on the video hosting site RuTube. The channel was removed soon after the pranksters published videos of their conversations with British Secretary of Defence Ben Wallace and Home Secretary Priti Patel, pretending to be Ukrainian PM Denis Shmygal. During the call with Wallace, the UK minister spilled the beans about arms deliveries to Ukraine and London's support for \"Kiev's plans\" to continue with a nuclear programme.  Meanwhile, Patel shared plans to deprive Russian tycoons of their property in the country and promised to keep allies in line, regarding support for Kiev. The minister was also trolled into saying various phrases, including \"Anglichanka gadit!\", a Russian colloquialism meaning \"the Englishwoman makes mischief\" or \"the Englishwoman plays it dirty\", a reference to the 19th-century foreign policy of Queen Victoria against Russia. After the clip of his conversation was published, Wallace claimed the video was \"doctored\" by the Russian state. At the same time, the British Ministry of Defence urged the platform to remove the videos. YouTube removed the channel of Vovan and Lexus amid reports suggesting that the platform may be blocked in Russia, since the video hosting service has already removed multiple channels by Russian media or blocked access to them around the world. This step comes in line with anti-Russian sanctions imposed over Moscow's military operation in Ukraine. The Russian media watchdog Roscomnadzor later slammed YouTube for allowing anti-Russian ads on the platform, which aim to discredit the Russian military and authorities.

In an interview with four Serbian media outlets, including Radio and Television of Serbia, the newspapers Vecernje novosti and Politika, as well as the Tanjug news agency, Lavrov also touched upon the West's sanctions against Russia over its special military operation in Ukraine. When asked about Russia's \"isolation\" in connection with the sanctions, he stressed that there is no such isolation and that his country has \"a huge number of partners in the Asia-Pacific region, in Africa, and Latin America\". According to Lavrov, Russia has \"good relations with the vast majority of organisations that were created by developing countries and, of course, among them are the African Union, and the community of Latin American and Caribbean countries, as well as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and many others\". The Russian foreign minister also dwelled upon the ongoing negotiations between Moscow and Kiev, adding that Russia hopes they will be a success. He made it clear that Moscow is ready to consider different locations for the continuation of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations, including Belgrade. Separately, he focused on a possible meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, which, Lavrov said, is needed as soon as there is clarity on key issues. He added that during the current negotiations with Ukraine, Moscow is obliged to make sure that \"the people in Donbass never again suffer from the Kiev regime\" and that \"Ukraine ceases to be a country that is constantly militarised\" in an attempt to threaten Russia. Lavrov additionally touted Sino-Russian relations, which he said were \"at their best level ever in history\". President Putin announced the beginning of a Russian special operation in Ukraine on 24 February, following a request for assistance from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, which had witnessed weeks of intensifying shelling by the Ukrainian Army.  In a televised address, Putin stressed that the goal of the operation is \"to protect people who have been subjected to abuse, genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years\", adding that for this purpose, Russia \"will strive to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine, as well as bring to justice those who committed numerous bloody crimes against peaceful residents, including citizens of the Russian Federation\".   The Russian Defence Ministry emphasised that the operation only targets Ukraine's military infrastructure with high-precision weapons and that civilians are out of danger.

Interviewed on Fox News by Tucker Carlson on Monday night, the former Democrat representative for Hawaii addressed Biden's allegedly unscripted remark in a speech in Poland that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"cannot remain in power.\" The White House and State Department rushed to walk back that comment, along with other where Biden told US troops stationed in eastern Europe they would see what's happening in Ukraine \"when you get there\" and that speculated use of chemical weapons, which Russia does not possess, \"would trigger a response in kind.\" \"They are doing so by waging this modern-day siege against Russia, isolating, containing, destroying their economy, starving the Russian people in the hope that the Russian people or the military will rise up and revolt and overthrow their government, and get rid of Putin\", she charged. Gabbard said the Biden administration was lying about its true intentions for fear of further alienating voters anxious about the conflict in Ukraine escalating to a nuclear war between NATO and Russia. \"The reason why they are lying about this to the American people, is, they know we are sick and tired of our country waging regime change wars\", she said. \"We remember how costly and devastating these wars in Iraq, Libya, Syria have been. And we rejected them wholeheartedly\". \"If they were to come out and tell the truth, their polls would tank even more than they already are, and their politics would suffer\", Gabbard stressed. \"The American people are smart enough to know that a regime change war against a nuclear-armed Russia is very different from any other that\u2019s been waged before, and will result in disastrous consequences that go beyond anything we could even imagine\". Biden faced a rare moment of difficult questioning from journalists a White House press conference on Monday. He refused to say how the US would respond to a hypothetical chemical warfare attack, which Russia has warned Ukrainian forces ate planning as a 'false flag' provocation, calling one reporter \"silly\" and insisting he was going to keep the world guessing. \"I'm not walking anything back\", he claimed, insisting he was venting his \"moral outrage\" and not \"articulating a policy change\", while admitting that \"nobody believes\" the US could \"take down\" Putin. And Biden broke into his now-famous stage whisper to claim that \"NATO has never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever been as strong as it is today\".

Bolton was US ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, and served as national security adviser to former President Donald Trump.  His tenure as national security adviser was cut short in September 2019 when he was unceremoniously fired in a Twitter post in which Trump wrote that he'd \"informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House\". Within months, Bolton was making appearances on political talk shows publicising his then-upcoming \"tell-all\" book in which he accused President Trump of wanting to \"continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including the Bidens\". The claim played a key role in the first of President Trump's two impeachments, because it appeared to validate some of the still-unproven allegations of impropriety surrounding weapons shipments which Democrats in Congress wanted the president to send to the Ukrainian regime. President Trump's response was immediate. The then-president promptly took to Twitter to allege that Bolton \"begged\" him for a job and that \"frankly\", if he had \"listened to [Bolton], we would be in World War Six by now\". Bolton's longstanding antipathy towards perceived enemy governments wasn't limited to the Russian leadership. \"The president was angered by Bolton's opposition\" to President Trump's proposed Afghanistan peace deal, PBS wrote at the time of Bolton's dismissal, and it reportedly wasn't the first time the two men clashed over Bolton's apparent refusal to cooperate with the White House's geopolitical vision.  It wasn't just the Trump crowd \u2013 Bolton's reputation for bellicosity earned him the ire of anti-intervention conservatives and liberals alike. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

We heard an announcement from the White House yesterday warning Americans that the Russians were preparing cyber attacks against US companies, government entities, and perhaps infrastructure. Then the Misfits talk about whether the rhetoric in the mainstream media about a \u201cNew World Order\u201d is a call for regime change in Russia. Next, Garett Reppenhagen, Director of Veterans for Peace joins the show to talk about the volunteers and for hire mercenaries fighting against Russians in Ukraine. There is a stream of reports about volunteers in the region that coordination is pretty chaotic. The Misfits talk about the formal military contractors such as Blackwater\u2019s Erik Prince which for nearly a year now plans to build a private army in Ukraine. And, the BBC earlier this month reported on ads for military contractors to help extract families from Ukraine. Later on the show, Juan Jose Gutierrez, immigration lawyer, executive director of the Full Rights for Immigrants Coalition joins the conversation to talk about GOP Latinos. Republicans and Democrats both need the Hispanic vote to win in competitive elections. And, the Misfits discuss strategies that both parties will probably employ to court the Latino vote for the 2022 midterms. For the last segment, Dan Lazare, writer and journalist, calls into the program to talk about Stormy Daniels ordered to pay Trump\u2019s legal fees after her defamation case was overturned. Then the Misfits talk about trade relations with Iran and the nuclear agreement. Sanctions are abuse, not so effective and provide an incentive for Iran to form alliances with other countries that will not include the US according to Lazare. The Misfits sign-off till tomorrow.

Some 71% of respondents indicated that they believe their country is \"on the wrong track\". Americans were specifically concerned by issues related to the economy, with 64% disapproving of Biden's handling of it. 62% said that their income has shrunk amid the growing cost of living. A majority of respondents considered this to be the most important issue facing the US. The poll also showed that Americans generally disapprove of the POTUS' handling of foreign policy issues, with 51% believing that he has underperformed in this sphere. The respondents also negatively evaluated Biden's policy on Ukraine, as only 28% assessed it positively. The latest data shows that the Biden administration and the Democratic Party he represents are set for a crushing defeat in the upcoming midterms this year, Republican pollster, Bill McInturff, said in a comment for NBC. The NBC poll generally confirmed McInturff's projections, as the GOP was shown to be leading  by two points ahead of the Democrats on the question of which party respondents want to win control of Congress.

He pointed the finger at Biden, arguing that POTUS is now afraid of attacking a \"nuclear power\", in an apparent reference to Russia. Trump also asserted that under his presidency, the Ukraine crisis would have never taken place, claiming that Moscow's special operation came after Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly saw Washington's \"weakness\". Additionally, Trump alleged that it was he, who initiated the beginning of US arms deliveries to Ukraine, including \"hundreds\" of Javelin portable anti-tank missile systems. The remarks followed the former POTUS telling his supporters at a rally in Florence, South Carolina, last week that \"despite all of Biden's weakness, cowardice, and incompetence, there is still a path for him to end this tragedy in Ukraine, without getting Americans snared in a gruesome and very bloody war\". This followed Biden saying in late February that he does not believe Americans have reason to be concerned about a nuclear war amid tensions with Russia over its special operation in Ukraine. Earlier that month, Putin said he had ordered \"the deterrence forces of the Russian Army to a special mode of combat duty\", due to \"aggressive statements\" by NATO leaders. Moscow's special operation, which has been underway since 24 February, was launched after the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for help in defending themselves against Kiev's forces. Russia said that the aim of the operation is to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine and that only the nation's military infrastructure is being targeted. The Kremlin has repeatedly stressed that it has no plans to occupy Ukraine. According to President Putin, the operation's goal is to protect the people of Donbass, \"who have been subjected to abuse, genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years\". In response, Western countries have rolled out a full-blown sanctions campaign against Moscow, which includes airspace closures and restrictive measures targeting numerous Russian officials and entities, media, and financial institutions.

You understand, this is not just a suspension for six months, everything was planned. \u201cThe idea was to prevent me from playing in the Candidates Tournament and to deprive me of a possible entry into the [world title] match with Magnus Carlsen. \u201cI don't know if I'll be returning in six months to tournaments under the auspices of FIDE. They dishonored not me, but themselves. \u201cI just don't remember such a precedent when a chess player was not allowed on principle. It\u2019s a shame.\"Karjakin also suggested that the decision from FIDE, which has a Russian president in Arkady Dvorkovich, was politically motivated.\u201cIt's just the idea\u00a0\u2013 Dvorkovich is trying to show that he is a European official. He wants to remain FIDE president. He decided to sacrifice me for his political ambitions,\" he said.The FIDE suspension comes after the group unanimously decided that\u00a0Karjakin's statements in support of the Russian military operation in Ukraine were in breach of its Code of Ethics.\u00a0Elsewhere, fellow Russian grandmaster Sergey Shipov, who was also the subject of a FIDE investigation due to pro-Russia statements, was not issued with a suspension after it was found that his statements were supposedly less provocative.\u00a0\u201cThe statements by Sergey Karjakin on the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine has led to a considerable number of reactions on social media and elsewhere, to a large extent negative towards the opinions expressed by Sergey Karjakin,\" said FIDE in a lengthy document explaining its decision.Karjakin has 21 days to appeal the judgement, with the\u00a0Russian Chess Federation saying that it intended to do so in the near future.Karjakin, though, sees any appeal as being entirely futile.\u201cI don\u2019t see the point of filing an appeal\u00a0\u2013 any court will take the side of Europe. And FIDE is an international sports organization that does like everyone else. And by some coincidence, a Russian is still leading it. I think that this is not for long,\u201d said Karjakin.\u201cI understood that there was such a danger [of disqualification], but I believe that I am first and foremost a citizen and patriot of my country, and I say this without any boasting. If such a situation arose again, I would not be silent, but again I would write such a letter. I do not regret what I did. Choosing between supporting my country and participating in the Candidates Tournament, I would always choose the first one,\" he added.Statements made by\u00a0Karjakin in the last three weeks are central to FIDE's decision to ban him.Shortly after the onset of the operation in Ukraine, he shared an open letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, writing: \"I appeal to you at this difficult time, when our country, led by you, is fighting for the safety of the peaceful Russian population of Donbass and the Lugansk People\u2019s Republic.\u201cIt is fighting for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine with its ruling regime, which has put the security of all of Europe and our country at risk, for the sake of its political goals and ambitions.\u201cI am closely following the ongoing special operation, in the lands where I spent my childhood, where I learned to play chess and where my relatives still live.\u201cFor eight long years we have been waiting with hope for salvation from countless shelling and loss of human lives, the ongoing genocide by the still acting Kiev regime.\u201cI express to you, our commander-in-chief, full support in protecting the interests of Russia, our multinational Russian people, eliminating threats and establishment of peace!

Sources also say that the deal provides for increasing US LNG exports for 2023.The United States has already banned Russian energy imports, with the UK voicing plans to follow suit by year\u2019s end. However, European countries have not reached common ground on the matter, with many fearing that energy prices could spike ever higher after already breaking a record earlier this month. Prices skyrocketed after Russia was sanctioned over the launch of a military operation in Ukraine, sparking fears of gas supply disruptions.Europe gets over 40% of its total natural gas imports from Russia, having bought around 155 billion cubic meters of gas in 2021. Meanwhile, US LNG exports to the EU were a little over 22 billion cubic meters last year. According to sources, US President Joe Biden on Thursday said his country would increase LNG deliveries by 15 billion cubic meters this year, but analysts say the US is already producing the commodity at full capacity, and that for any additional gas to go to Europe it would have to be taken from exports initially aimed for other buyers.Meanwhile, Russia on Wednesday said it is set to change existing gas contracts and demand that states that imposed sanctions on the country pay for the commodity in rubles. The announcement puzzled Russia\u2019s gas buyers and drew further concerns of potential disruptions to Europe's gas supply.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"},{"uuid":"14e06908-f44f-412b-97f3-7e7e3fce1450","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552195-pentagon-no-fly-zone\/","title":"Pentagon justifies Ukraine no-fly zone decision","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6233f9fb85f540356b00bc11.jpg","subtitle":"The US defense secretary says there is \u2018no such thing as a no-fly zone light\u2019","content":"Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin said a no-fly zone over Ukraine remains off the table, explaining that the move would mean direct confrontation between US and Russian fighter jets and likely a hot war with Moscow.Asked about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s repeated calls on Western powers to take control of his country\u2019s airspace to repel a Russian attack, Austin said the Joe Biden administration would not grant the request, citing the risk of escalation.\u201cEnforcing a no-fly zone actually means that you're in combat, you're in a fight with Russia. And that's one of the things that we have said, that our president has said, that we weren't going to do,\u201d the defense secretary said.In order to control the skies, you have to shut down the air defenses that are on the ground and some of those air defense systems are in Russia.

A no fly zone means that you're in a conflict with Russia.Austin went on to note that while there are some \u201ceffective\u201d means of defense against long-range missiles and artillery, a no-fly zone would be of little help against such weapons, namely when they are used from within Russian territory.\u201cThe rockets are actually cruise missiles\u2026 that were fired from aerial platforms, I think you know that those were fired from actually inside of Russia, so a no-fly zone would not have prevented that activity,\u201d he continued.President Biden has been under increasing pressure to step up US aid to Kiev, having already sent hundreds of millions in arms and other military hardware prior to a new $800 million weapons package this week. The latest shipment includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems \u2013 a newer addition to Ukraine\u2019s arsenal \u2013 as well as thousands of tank-killing Javelin missiles.\u00a0In an address to American lawmakers on Wednesday, Zelensky again pleaded for a no-fly zone enforced by the NATO bloc, though acknowledged the move is a red line for the Biden administration. The US president was apparently not persuaded by the latest appeal, as White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that an NFZ was still not an option soon after Zelensky\u2019s address, stating \u201cWe are not interested in getting into World War III.\u201d\u00a0Nonetheless, the defense secretary said Washington would continue to \u201cdo everything within our power to support Ukraine in their efforts to defend their territory,\u201d including by reinforcing the Ukrainian military with arms and munitions, as well as helping to \u201cbackfill\u201d the armories of foreign allies who provide weapons of their own.\u00a0Russia sent troops into Ukraine in late February, claiming the government in Kiev had failed to live up to peace deals to end fighting with two breakaway republics in the Donbass region while setting out to \u201cdemilitarize\u201d and \u201cdenazify\u201d the country.

The beneficiary charities will be announced in due course after consultation with the club,\" it was concluded.While Chelsea still cannot sell buy or sell players, nor sell extra tickets to their fans for home games that were previously only attended by season ticket holders, the fresh measures are still a boost to the club.Chelsea supporters can now head out on the road to back Thomas Tuchel's men in important fixtures against Southampton, Leeds United, Everton and Manchester United as they look to secure third place in the Premier League.\u00a0No less importantly, they can cheer on the Blues at\u00a0Stamford Bridge as their Champions League title defense continues in the quarter-finals against 13-times winners Real Madrid on April 6, and then at the\u00a0Bernabeu six days later after it was previously feared the fixture might have to be played behind closed doors.\u00a0Chelsea fans can also attend an FA Cup semi-final date with cross-city rivals Crystal Palace after the Madrid return leg on April 16, though it is possible that the club might have been sold then to its first owners since Abramovich took over the reins in 2003 and began a 21-trophy dynasty.The amendments to the license come after the FA stated\u00a0it hoped to have a sell-out crowd at the Wembley last four showdown and that it was \"working with the Government on a method to achieve this whilst respecting the sanctions that are currently in place on Chelsea.\"And while the Ricketts family, Chelsea fan John Candy, and a Todd Boehly and Hansjorg Wyss consortium battle it out to take over at Stamford

He said a simple \u201ccommitment of no eastward expansion could have easily ended the crisis and stopped the suffering.\u201d\u201cInstead, one chose to fan the flames at a safe distance, watching its own arms dealers, bankers, and oil tycoons make a fortune out of the war, while leaving the people of a small country with the wounds of war that would take years to heal,\u201d he said.NATO\u2019s pursuit of \u201cabsolute security\u201d leads instead to \u201cabsolute non-security,\u201d Le added.The consequences of forcing a major power, especially a nuclear power, into a corner are even more unimaginable.Moscow has vehemently opposed NATO\u2019s presence close to its borders, and embarked on a mission to obtain written guarantees that would halt the US-led military bloc\u2019s expansion and bar Ukraine from joining its ranks. However, the West ignored Russia\u2019s concerns.Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d on February 24, with a stated goal to \u201cdemilitarize and denazify\u201d Ukraine, ensuring it no longer posed a threat to either Russia or the newly recognized Donbass republics, which have suffered seven years of grueling siege.\u00a0The US and its NATO allies have accused Russia of starting an \u201cunprovoked\u201d war to conquer and subsume Ukraine. Moscow has seen thousands of harsh new curbs and sanctions slapped on it as a result, with the US, the EU, and others seeking to \u201cisolate\u201d and \u201cdestroy\u201d the Russian economy.\u201cHistory has proven time and again that sanctions cannot solve problems,\u201d Le said. \u201cThe sanctions against Russia are getting more and more outrageous ... Sanctions will only harm ordinary people, impact the economic and financial system ... and worsen the global economy.\u201dBeijing has come under increased pressure from the West to distance itself from Moscow and sever its trade ties, after China abstained from a United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine, choosing to remain neutral, alongside India, Pakistan, South Africa, and 30 other countries.In a video conference call with Biden on Friday, Xi stressed that China had always stood \u201cfor peace and opposes war,\u201d and urged all parties involved in the conflict to return to diplomacy. In response, Biden warned him that Beijing would face \u201cconsequences\u201d should it provide material support to Russia or help it evade Western sanctions."},{"uuid":"17721d28-3b08-41b5-aa54-1c9a0a8cf416","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552646-kosovo-war-nato-ukraine-hypocrisy\/","title":"The road to Ukraine started with 1999\u2019s Kosovo War","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623cb59685f540451f6c7ec6.jpg","subtitle":"Supporters of NATO\u2019s war on Yugoslavia have no right to talk about law, sovereignty or borders","content":"Pretty much everyone who has spent the past month moralizing about the sanctity of borders, sovereignty of countries, and how unacceptable it was for great powers to \u201cbully\u201d smaller neighbors \u2013 thinking of Russia and Ukraine \u2013 paused on Thursday to sing praises to a woman that championed all of those things back in 1999. Except since it was NATO doing them to Yugoslavia, Madeleine Albright was a hero and an icon, obviously.On March 24, 1999, NATO launched an air war against Serbia and Montenegro, then known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The publicly stated aim of Operation Allied Force was to compel Belgrade to accept the ultimatum given at the French chateau of Rambouillet the month before: Hand the province of Kosovo over to NATO \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d and allow ethnic Albanian separatists to declare independence.\u00a0When the bombers failed to achieve that within a couple of weeks, the narrative changed to NATO acting to stop a \u201cgenocide\u201d of Albanians its cheerleader press claimed was taking place. That narrative also credited the first-ever female US secretary of state for the \u201chumanitarian\u201d bombing, calling it\u00a0\u201cMadeleine\u2019s War.\u201d\u00a0In the end, it took 78 days and a negotiated armistice for NATO troops to enter Kosovo wearing the fig leaf of a UN peacekeeping mission. They promptly turned the province over to the \u201cKosovo Liberation Army\u201d terrorists, who proceeded to burn, loot, murder and expel over 200,000 non-Albanians. A real campaign of terror, intimidation, ethnic cleansing and pogroms began \u2013 and the very same media that covered for NATO by making up atrocities during the bombing now turned a blind eye, for the same reason.Whatever its outcome, however, it was an evil little war, launched because the US felt it could. Because Washington wanted to get rid of the restraints posed by the UN to its new global hegemony, articulated just a few years earlier by Bill Kristol and Victoria Nuland\u2019s husband Robert Kagan. Because the rising American Empire wanted to send a message to Eastern Europe that no dissent would be tolerated, and to Russia that it was no longer a great power worth respecting.\u00a0A legalistic mind might point out that the attack violated Articles 2, 53 and 103 of the UN Charter, NATO\u2019s own charter \u2013 the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 (articles 1 and 7) \u2013 as well as the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 (violating the territorial integrity of a signatory state) and the 1980 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, for using coercion to compel a state to sign a treaty.\u00a0Ah, but being a world empire means making its own \u201crules-based order\u201d to supplant inconvenient laws. So an \u201cindependent commission\u201d of cheerleaders was put together to declare the operation \u201cillegal but legitimate,\u201d arguing it was justified because it \u201cliberated\u201d the Kosovo Albanians from Serb \u201coppression.\u201dThe actual oppression of non-Albanians as NATO troops stood idly by \u2013 including during the vicious pogrom of March 2004 \u2013 doesn\u2019t count, obviously. The important thing is that Bill and Hillary Clinton, Madeleine Albright, and British PM Tony Blair got monuments, streets, and even children named after them.The \u201cindependent\u201d Kosovo \u2013 proclaimed in 2008, in a move about as legal as the 1999 war \u2013 can\u2019t actually do anything without the permission of the US ambassador. A great triumph of human rights, law and order, and democracy, everyone!NATO never cared about saving Albanian lives. If it did, it wouldn\u2019t have partnered with the KLA, which made a point of murdering ethnic Albanians who wanted peace with the Serbs. It wouldn\u2019t have repeatedly bombed refugee columns, then declaring it was really the Serbs\u2019 fault somehow and that pilots dropped their bombs \u201cin good faith\u201d \u2013 literally something NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said on one occasion.\u00a0Twenty years on and nothing has changed. Having obliterated a family in Kabul by a drone strike last August, the US offered blood money, but refused to so much as reprimand anyone involved. Being an empire means never having to say you\u2019re sorry. This mindset propelled the invasion of Iraq in 2003.Meanwhile, failure to overthrow the government in Belgrade through war led to a \u201ccolor revolution\u201d in Serbia instead. It was then exported to other places \u2013 including Ukraine, twice. That 2014 coup in Kiev literally started the conflict in eastern Ukraine, of which the current events are but the latest phase.In March 1999, I was a student in the American Midwest, and had been (almost) successfully brainwashed into believing the platitudes about freedom, democracy, tolerance, objectivity, rules and laws, and how the US was a \u201cforce for good\u201d in the world. Then, overnight, people I thought had been my friends called me a monster and believed every single bit of propaganda that came off the TV screens and newspaper pages.\u00a0I\u2019ve made justice and remembrance something of my life mission since then, seeking to explain that rather than a good, noble and humanitarian war, Kosovo represented everything wrong about the modern world: \u201cA monument to the power of lies, the successful murder of law, and the triumph of might over justice,\u201d as I wrote in 2005, and repeated every year since.The twist this year is that the people shrieking about human rights, international law and the sanctity of borders \u2013 when it comes to their client regime in Ukraine, that is \u2013 were all cheering for NATO back in 1999. Even now, they won\u2019t apologize for it, much less disavow. So it seems it\u2019s not really about what is being done, only who is doing it to whom. While I understand their anger as the world their lies propped up comes crashing down, they hardly have standing to complain."},{"uuid":"17d32f23-beb4-4368-91ca-6d919150bd5b","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220319\/iran-reportedly-built-covert-financial-system-to-trade-with-foreign-countries-despite-us-sanctions-1094017549.html","title":"Iran Reportedly Built Covert Financial System to Trade With Foreign Countries Despite US Sanctions","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e5\/04\/12\/1082662088_0:0:3058:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_3d66b0e54d3662000a2c15d56c9c9bad.jpg?source-sid=afp","subtitle":"The WSJ story about Iran's system to circumvent American sanctions casts a shadow on the prospects of the US and EU's recent sanctions succeeding in severing Russia from the financial and other global markets over the situation in Ukraine.","content":"Iran built a clandestine banking and finance system that allowed the country to continue trading with other countries using foreign currency even under the weight of the US sanctions re-introduced in 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing documents and accounts of anonymous Western diplomats and intelligence officials. The volumes of Iran's obscured trade might have reached \"tens of billions of dollars\" and effectively allowed the country to restore the economy tanked by the sanctions and practically return it to the levels before the economic measures against it were re-introduced. While Iran never hid the fact that it had discovered a way to continue trading despite the American sanctions, it never revealed the scheme. The WSJ describes the system organised by the Islamic Republic as a combination of Iranian companies' proxies, accounts in foreign banks and internal transactions inside Iran itself recorded on a separate secret ledger. Iranian banks reportedly serve as bridges between sanctioned companies and the firms that can maintain some connections with the outside world. The latter create companies outside the Islamic Republic to act on behalf of the sanctioned Iranian firms, the newspaper's investigation and accounts of Western officials suggest. These proxies then engage in trade with foreign companies selling oil and Iranian commodities, the WSJ reported. A small portion of the proceeds from this trade is reportedly being smuggled into Iran in the form of currency which is used, among other things, to boost the exchange rate of Iran's rial, which also plummeted in 2018. However, the majority of the cash remains in foreign banks. These dollars, euros and other currencies are then used to buy imports for the Islamic republic. The sanctioned Iranian companies also trade this foreign-stashed currency with each other using ledgers that do not leave Iran. While the Iranian shadow trading and financial system shows the limits of the US sanctions campaign, it also has its downsides, the newspaper said. According to its sources, both in Western countries and in Iran, this system is inefficient and is susceptible to corruption. However, despite these drawbacks, Tehran is likely to leave it in place \u2013 even if it negotiates the restoration of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with the US and the remaining signatories of the original 2015 nuclear accord, the WSJ sources said. The existing system will reportedly be kept in place as a safeguard in case the JCPOA parties decide to slap Iran with sanctions again, as well as to keep some of Tehran's transactions obscured. Moreover, even with the sanctions lifted, foreign companies are unlikely to be quick to return to the Iranian market, fearful of the remaining sanctions and accidently violating the US rules with regards to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which Washington recognises as a terrorist organisation. With this secret economic vehicle in place, Iran's trade with foreign countries reached $80 billion a year in 2021, according to a senior Iranian politician, Gholamreza Mesbahi-Moghaddam. The figure could grow to almost twice that level in 2022, the International Monetary Fund has estimated.  Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Von der Leyen, for her part, said that she expects US gas to replace Russian gas in the EU.  According to the White House's statement, \"the United States will work with international partners and strive to ensure additional LNG volumes for the EU market of at least 15 bcm in 2022, with expected increases going forward.\" Russia supplies 40% of the EU's gas and over a quarter of the oil it imports. Also on Friday, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo commented on the EU's plans to reduce the impact of high energy prices on consumers, saying that the EU needed to \"buy together and intervene in the market to reduce prices\".  Natural gas prices in Europe have been rising dramatically since last year over growing energy demand, amid an economic recovery after months of COVID lockdowns and a limited supply. The need for the EU's energy security became even more pressing amid Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, and unprecedented sanctions imposed by the US and its allies against Russia.

According to Coldiretti, for every euro spent by consumers on food products, only between six and 15 cents go to farmers. The price of bread, for instance, is now nearly 13 times the cost of wheat.The group does not propose any solutions to the problem, but paints a dramatic scenario in which the closure of farms would lead to a decrease in crops and force the country to depend even more on agricultural imports. Italy already buys 64% of its grain abroad, as well as 49% of beef and 38% of pork. It also imports over half the corn crops and a third of the soy crops required for animal nutrition, according to the Centro Studi Divulga.

The delegation arrived on the island on 1 March to deliver \"a message of reassurance\" to Taipei amid \"China\u2019s growing military threat,\" according to the Guardian. Beijing denounced the move as violating China's national sovereignty: \"The attempt by the US to show support to Taiwan will be in vain, no matter who the US sends. The Chinese people are firmly determined and resolved to defend (their) national sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin stated on 2 March. At the same time, reports started to emerge in the US media about the US Indo-Pacific Command's (INDOPACOM) plan to spend $27 billion over the next six years to \"deter China\" in the Pacific region. According to the Drive, the DoD's recent plan is an expansion of the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, or PDI, which was included by the US Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for the 2021 Fiscal Year. The new grand design envisages spending between $27.3 billion and $27.4 billion in total through Fiscal Year 2027. \"This includes $2.2 billion to be spent in the 2021 Fiscal Year and another $4.6 billion expected to be available in the next fiscal cycle,\" the media specifies. In particular, the plan envisions the creation of \"highly survivable, precision-strike networks along the First Island Chain, featuring increased quantities of ground-based weapons,\" referring to an area of the Pacific inside a boundary formed by the first line of archipelagos out from mainland East Asia. This area includes the contested South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. According to the Drive, in general, the initiative \"include[s] the establishment of forward-deployed long-range strike capabilities, including elements that could be armed ground-based cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic missiles\" as well as \"more capable missile defences,\" \"space-based and terrestrial sensors\". Meanwhile, the US Senate on 10 March poked Beijing by passing an amendment prohibiting the State Department from purchasing any map that \"inaccurately depicts the territory and social and economic system of Taiwan and the islands or island groups administered by Taiwan authorities\". According to Taiwan Times, the vague text actually meant maps depicting \"Taiwan as part of China\". The Chinese Foreign Ministry on 14 March strongly opposed the US congressional maps bans, stressing that \"there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, which is both a historical and legal fact and the consensus of the international community.\" The Western media continued to ramp up the narrative about China's alleged \"bellicose\" plans with regard to Taiwan with the Business Insider warning on 10 March that after the beginning of the Russian special operation in Ukraine \"US officials have also been watching China closely, looking for signs that Beijing is capitalising on turmoil in Europe to strike Taiwan.\" On 16 March, Newsweek claimed that Chinese President Xi Jinping \"had plans to annex\" the Taiwan island in autumn 2022 but that Russia's special operation in Ukraine \"shut\" this \"window of opportunity\" for Beijing. To back this claim Newsweek cited \"a purported Russian intelligence document\" written by \"an anonymous analyst with Russia's Federal Security Service\" (FSB). Newsweek made it clear that it \"wasn't able to independently verify the authenticity of the FSB letter.\" Instead, the media quoted Christo Grozev, the executive director of Bellingcat, who said that his \"FSB contacts\" alleged that the \"whistleblower\" in question was authentic but did not agree with the conclusions of his analysis. However, Bellingcat could hardly be regarded as objective and independent, according to independent investigative reporters of Grayzone. Grayzone journalists previously detailed how Bellingcat covertly cooperated with the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), received funding from Western intelligence contractors and the US government\u2019s National Endowment for Democracy, \"employed a staggering number of former [Western] military and intelligence operatives,\" and peddled unconfirmed and dubious narratives about Russia and Syria. The Chinese officials have repeatedly shredded the Western claims of Beijing's war plans concerning Taiwan, adding that there are no links between Russia's special operation to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" Ukraine and China's relations with its island. In his 15 March op-ed for The Washington Post, Qin Gang, the ambassador of the People\u2019s Republic of China to the United States, also rubbished claims of China's alleged foreknowledge of the Russian Ukraine operation. The Chinese top diplomat underscored that Taiwan is a \"Chinese internal affair\". According to The Global Times, Washington's attempts to poke Beijing over Taiwan are part of the US attempts to force China to join the US sanctions spree against Russia over Ukraine. \"The US should not expect other countries to solve the mess it made in Ukraine while it still ramps up assistance and offers weapons to Ukraine,\" writes the Chinese daily writes citing L\u00fc Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. \"Currently, the conflicts between the US and Russia and between China and the US all have roots in the US, and the US is trying to sow discord between Russia and China.\" "},{"uuid":"1917c168-5ed0-43ae-80f2-b412944b2179","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220329\/russian-defence-minister-russia-reached-main-goal-of-first-phase-of-special-operation-in-ukraine-1094286774.html","title":"Shoigu: Russia to Focus on Liberation of Donbass as Main Goals of First Phase of Ukraine Op Achieved","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e6\/03\/1d\/1094287828_0:0:2800:1867_1440x900_80_0_1_77724e019d0fa75bedebbe5868573999.jpg?source-sid=","subtitle":"President Vladimir Putin ordered to launch a special operation on 24 February describing its key goals as the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine.

The Russian minister noted that the Ukrainian Air Force and air defences have been practically eliminated and its navy ceased to exist following the start of the operation. Shoigu also reported successes in combating foreign mercenaries that arrived in Ukraine over the past month. Some 600 foreign mercenaries were killed and 500 more decided to leave Ukraine voluntarily, the minister said. The Russian defence minister further condemned the West's decision to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine, calling the move \"reckless\". He noted that Kiev is \"mindlessly\" handing out those weapons to the local population and mercenaries, adding that this might create threats to Europeans themselves in the future. Russia will also respond \"adequately\" if foreign countries start supplying Ukraine with jets and air defence systems, Shoigu said without elaborating further. So far, the West has only supplied man-portable anti-air weapons to Ukraine and refrained from shipping any fighter jets amid fears of escalating tensions with Moscow. Shoigu further pointed to the \"mindless\" use of certain weapons by Ukraine in various regions. Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February in response to a request from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) to defend them against attacks by the Ukrainian military and nationalist battalions. Both republics had suffered from intense shelling for over a week by that moment. Announcing the operation, Russian President Vladimir Putin described its main goals as the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine. The Russian delegation at the peace talks with Kiev discussed the county's neutral status and refusal to join NATO, as one of the key points for an agreement that would end the special operation.

The bombing continued for 78 days and ended with a negotiated armistice, allowing UN peacekeepers into the rebel province of Kosovo.Because Russia was weak and ruled by the \u201cWestern oligarchy\u201d propping up President Boris Yeltsin, Serbia was \u201cabsolutely alone\u201d in fighting for its freedom, borders and survival, Kusturica told RT from his home in Mecavnik.This was \u201cwhen international law was changed to what I call \u2018humanitarian\u2019 law,\u201d the filmmaker said, alluding to NATO\u2019s official reasoning that it was trying to stop a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo, and the subsequent doctrine of \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d created to justify the war.\u00a0\u201cThis war did not just come out of nowhere. This is a continuation of something seeded much earlier,\u201d the director said, referring to the current conflict over Ukraine. Kusturica sees a continuity of Russophobia in the West, which rejected Russia\u2019s offer of partnership after the Cold War.NATO claimed the bombing brought peace, but the only thing it achieved was to enable the October 2000 color revolution, Kusturica noted. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was overthrown in what would become a template for two such revolts in Ukraine, first in 2004 and then in 2014.\u00a0Bombing of Serbia was just the first act, now we\u2019re witnessing the second act of the same story.Serbs aren\u2019t pro-war, they just remember 1999 and understand the causes of the current conflict in Ukraine, Kusturica told RT.\u201cIn a unipolar world, nobody is paying a price for [their] moves,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cNow we\u2019re facing the deconstruction of power around the world, and what matters I think in the end is what kind of weapons you have.\u201dBack in 1999, Serbia did not have the most modern weapons \u2013 Yeltsin blocked the delivery of air defense systems that might have made more of a difference, Kusturica said. Even so, the Serbs managed to shoot down a US \u201cstealth\u201d bomber. They remember NATO\u2019s \u201chumanitarian\u201d bombs even today, he added.\u201cThey never came on the ground, because they know how the Serbian people fight,\u201d Kusturica pointed out.Yugoslavia ended in 2006, when Montenegro declared independence. The ethnic Albanian provisional government in Kosovo \u2013 backed by NATO \u2013 did so in 2008, though without recognition from Belgrade. Serbia is now an \u201cisland\u201d in a sea of NATO states on almost all sides. Yet it is still a place where not all media are under Western control, and where one can still raise a voice against injustice and censorship, Kusturica said.He condemned what he described as an\u00a0\u201calmost incredibly satanic version of cancel culture\u201d that now bans Russian conductors, composers and authors, stopping just short of burning books in city squares like the Nazis used to do.\u00a0Russian authors like \u201cChekhov, Pushkin, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy are inseparable from what we call European culture,\u201d Kusturica said, arguing the West is now attempting to cut them off, but that the world will \u201ceventually see these pieces coming back together.\u201dBorn in what is today Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kusturica made his first feature film in 1981, going on to direct a series of award-winning features and try his hand at acting, music and writing as well. He resides in an ethnic-themed village in western Serbia, originally built as the set for his 2003 film \u2018Life is a Miracle\u2019."},{"uuid":"19393479-8275-45de-bd66-ae1cf74d9cde","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/business\/552514-tap-water-german-economy\/","title":"Germans told to drink tap water as prices surge","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623af19485f54034085db049.jpg","subtitle":"They are also advised to buy seasonal food and local produce, and watch for discounts","content":"German news magazine Focus has advised readers to change their spending and lifestyle habits in order to save money amid skyrocketing prices.According to the publication, Russia\u2019s military operation in Ukraine and the economic sanctions placed on Moscow have resulted in additional problems in supply chains and have driven up energy prices. This, in turn, has affected the product range and prices across German supermarket chains.Prices for basic products such as pasta and sunflower oil, for instance, have soared by 40% and 100% respectively. Detergents, mineral water, dairy products, coffee, and toilet paper are also more expensive. Popular supermarket chain Aldi raised prices on 140 different items last week, and other supermarkets are likely to follow suit, according to Focus.However, the publication has come up with a number of measures to help consumers save money. To start with, readers are advised to drink tap water instead of buying bottled water. The publication even lists a number of firms producing water filtration systems in Germany which could help improve the taste of tap water.It also says shoppers should buy seasonal fruits and vegetables because they are always much cheaper due to the low costs regarding logistics.Additionally, the publication recommends that customers choose local and unadvertised brands instead of popular ones. Almost every supermarket chain has its own line of cheaper products. As they are always backed by larger producers, the products are almost the same or just slightly different, but the prices can be up to 60% lower.Finally, the magazine says readers should keep close track of sales and discounts, and stock up on large packs of products which have a long shelf life.On average, consumer prices were 5.5% higher in Germany last month than in February 2021, figures from the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) show. And analysts say things will only get worse if the situation in Ukraine is not resolved. According to the German Economic Institute, the crisis itself, as well as related Western sanctions and Moscow\u2019s counter-sanctions, could drive inflation as high as 6.1% in the coming months.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"},{"uuid":"1964a703-b76c-49a1-9511-89c6eaf27ee5","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220327\/turkish-refusal-to-sanction-wealthy-russians-signals-fractures-in-nato-anti-russia-crusade-1094229050.html","title":"Turkish Refusal to Sanction Wealthy Russians Signals Fractures in NATO Anti-Russia Crusade","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e5\/04\/08\/1082575438_0:0:2923:2047_1440x900_80_0_1_da68dac85eb6b172d315c0667409c5e4.jpg?source-sid=ap_photo","subtitle":"Turkey, Hungary, and others have angered other NATO nations by pursuing the interest of their own citizens over efforts to break Russians through a series of financial chokeholds.","content":"Western efforts to isolate Russia on the international stage were dealt another blow as Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Saturday that Russians will be free to carry out commercial activities in Turkey. \u201cIf Russian oligarchs or any Russian citizens want to visit Turkey, of course they can,\u201d Cavusoglu declared in response to a question given at Doha Forum international conference. Cavusoglu has given the indication that Russian nationals will not face additional impediments to commercial ventures in Turkey. Turkey, a member of NATO, has declined to sanction Russian citizens or close its airspace to Russian aircraft. Referring to the \u201cRussia-Ukraine crisis\u201d after this week\u2019s NATO leaders' summit in Brussels, Turkish President Recep Erdogan said, \u201cTurkey's main aim is to reconcile the parties.\u201d The country has taken a considerably less antagonistic position to the ongoing Russian special military operation aimed at denazifying and demilitarizing Ukraine than most of its European neighbors and is publicly considering implementing a Ruble-Lira exchange for the countries\u2019 tourism sectors. The Turkish government previously announced it was closing off access to the Black Sea to warships in response to petitions by western nations to invoke a 1936 international agreement that lets \u201cAnkara manage war traffic entering the two sea lanes during times of conflict,\u201d but it only did so after a lengthy delay. It\u2019s unclear whether the action has had any significant impact on the balance of forces in Ukraine. Turkey has also sold a number of Bayraktar TB2 drones to the Ukrainian regime. Turkey is just one of a number of increasingly independent countries drawing the ire of the US and leading European powers for their apparent failure to express sufficient animosity towards Russia. Hungary, another NATO nation and a member of the European Union, has also declined to participate in the Western campaign to alienate Russia. They have been similarly straightforward about the need to prioritize the development of their own economy over getting involved in foreign conflicts. The comments seemed to come in a response to a surprisingly disrespectful video address Friday in which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky openly demanded the Prime Minister \u201cdecide for yourself who you are with,\u201d and addressed Orban by his first name: \u201cListen, Viktor, do you know what\u2019s going on in Mariupol?\u201d The coastal city of Mariupol has been under the control of the Ukrainian National Guard\u2019s neo nazi Azov Batalion, but reports indicate Russian forces have made serious advances recently. Survivors who\u2019ve managed to escape have accused the Azov soldiers\u2014many of whom are open admirers of Adolf Hitler\u2014of numerous potential war crimes, including refusing to allow the civilian population to evacuate via humanitarian corridors organized by Russia. And according to a widely-shared article in independent outlet The Grayzone, \u201ctestimony by evacuated Mariupol residents and warnings of a false flag attack undermine the Ukrainian government\u2019s claims about a Russian bombing of a local theater sheltering civilians.\u201d "},{"uuid":"196293a9-bf15-4129-9c2a-cbc3957763e4","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220325\/russia-demands-rubles-for-gas-payment-rand-paul-supports-return-to-iran-deal-1094165246.html","title":"Russia Demands Rubles for Gas Payment; Rand Paul Supports Return to Iran Deal","image":null,"subtitle":"Russia has notified the EU that all \"unfriendly nations\" will be required to pay for gas in rubles.

The two countries are major exporters of potash, critical for the global agriculture industry, which is already reeling from pandemic-related disruptions.Last week, fertilizer prices surged nearly 10% versus the previous week, according to Green Markets North America Fertilizer Price Index, the highest price point ever recorded. The index shows current prices are 40% higher than a month ago, before Russia\u2019s military operation in Ukraine began.According to CRU, a UK-based commodity consultancy, prices for raw materials that make up the crop nutrient commodity market, such as ammonia, nitrogen, potash, urea, phosphates, sulphates and nitrates, saw a 30% surge since the beginning of the year, topping the levels reached during the 2008 financial crisis.Russia and Belarus are major exporters of several critical fertilizing compounds, including urea and potash.Nola urea is trading at a 34-year high of $880 per US ton compared to $182 recorded in 2020. Prices are up 60% since the West imposed sanctions against the two countries.Spiking prices for fertilizers have also been exacerbated by higher costs for natural gas, a vital feedstock in producing nitrogen-based fertilizer. Energy prices have been soaring amid EU plans to cut reliance on Russian oil and gas supplies and bans imposed by the US and a couple of other countries.The situation is also being aggravated by China\u2019s ban on fertilizer exports, primarily nitrogen and phosphate. The measure, which expires in June, was implemented to limit the rise in domestic food prices.Moreover, a labor dispute at Canadian Pacific Railways is expected to worsen shortages, putting additional pressure on the global logistic chains.

Soon after, infamous Russian pranksters Vovan and Lexus released clips of their conversation with Wallace.","content":"Vovan and Lexus have released a full, 16-minute video of their conversation with UK Secretary of Defence Wallace, and the clip, in which they pretended to be the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmygal, contains new quips not seen in previously released teasers. A video of the call was originally posted on the pranksters' official YouTube channel, which was blocked by the platform on Saturday. UK Ready to Discuss \u2018Security Alliance\u2019 Asked to comment on the prospects of a military alliance between Britain and Ukraine, Wallace said that the UK was \u201cvery keen to support you in any negotiations.\u201d \u201cI know, my understanding is that President Zelensky is quite keen to see the United Kingdom alongside Ukraine in these negotiations because of the experience that we (well we didn\u2019t have), but the bad experience of the Minsk Agreement, where just France and Germany were there and I think there is a desire for the UK and the US. And I think all of those subjects, including a security alliance, I think, is something to discuss with you on those negotiations,\u201d the official said. Signed in February of 2015, the Minsk agreements saw the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France gather in the Belarusian capital to hammer out a peace treaty \u2013 including a ceasefire deal and a peace plan aimed at putting an end to the conflict in the Donbass by reintegrating the region into Ukraine in exchange for constitutionally-guaranteed autonomy. In the seven years since the agreement was signed, successive Ukrainian governments failed to make necessary reforms, notwithstanding pressure from both Russia and Europe (but, crucially \u2013 not the Washington establishment) to do so. Ukraine Will Go It Alone Asked to comment on the Kremlin's negotiating position in the Ukraine crisis, including the requirement of \u201ciron-clad\u201d guarantees that Ukraine will not join NATO, Wallace said that \u201cthe freedom to choose is a very important freedom for Ukraine. Russia\u2019s other demands of Crimea and Donbass, to abandon all those, which I don\u2019t think Ukraine will, but if Russia was to be successful, the question is, you know, Russia is still a war criminal, with sanctions around its neck and deserves to keep them there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to discussions about security guarantees, I think we need to support you in what is the other parts of the agreement as well, you know, what are other parts of the agreement that Russia will demand and whether you think they are appropriate or whether they are acceptable. Because I don\u2019t think Russia should be able to demand anything other than going home,\u201d Wallace added. No-Fly Zone &amp; British Warships in the Black Sea Asked to comment on Ukraine\u2019s repeated requests that NATO set up a no-fly zone over Ukraine, Wallace ably deflected the direction of the inquiry to discuss Britain\u2019s arms deliveries. \u201cI\u2019ve just been looking at our new anti-aircraft missile that we\u2019re sending you which is better than Stinger, it\u2019ll work at night. It\u2019s a very, very fast missiles and it will help close the skies to Russian aircraft,\u201d he said. Wallace also suggested that a no-fly zone would be a two-way street, preventing Ukraine\u2019s own aircraft and Turkish-sourced drones from operating and attacking Russian ground forces. Asked whether the UK might deploy its warships in the Black Sea to help Ukraine, Wallace returned: \u201cRight now you mean, in the war?\u201d The defence minister mentioned a 2021 UK stunt involving the sailing the HMS Defender destroyer into Russian territorial waters around Crimea. \u201cRemember last year we took HMS Defender past Crimea and the Russians behaved illegally then. So look, I am considering more and more weapons systems to help. We will go into the Black Sea, I think we\u2019re due to go soon. How close we go to Ukrainian waters where the Russians currently have a blockade I think we will be open to discussions about looking at that.\u201d Asked whether the UK might join Ukraine in fighting Russia directly in the \u201cnext stage,\u201d Wallace avoided the bait. \u201cOn the next stage, we would always be keen to be with you in Ukraine. But I mean - if a peace deal is there, we\u2019re not going to \u2013 if you make a deal that is right for you in Ukraine and you are happy to deliver, Britain will look at all options to help you, including being in Ukraine. I have troops in Poland, I have troops in Estonia, I have troops in Lithuania. I am happy to be with you in Ukraine in, obviously subject to \u2013 if you remember we had 100 troops, an orbital training team, we\u2019ve had that since 2015. But we could look at all sorts of options,\u201d he noted. UK Said To Be Running Out of NLAWs for Its Own Army Asked whether the UK would be able to provide Ukraine with newer NLAW anti-tank missiles due to high failure rate of old ones, Wallace bristled, noting that Britain\u2019s deliveries were not failing, and that the country was sending so many of the weapons to the defense of Ukraine that the British Army was running out of its own stocks. Nukes After the prankster suggested that Kiev was \u201cinterested\u201d in exploring a nuclear weapons programme, Wallace said that Russia would \u201creally hate that,\u201d and called the issue one of those \u201cbigger questions\u201d that he would need to speak to the prime minister about. He added, however, that \u201cthe principle is, we will support Ukraine as our friend in the choices you make. Whether you want to be part of NATO or you don\u2019t want to be part of NATO, whether you want to explore new weapons, etc. That is all a matter for you to decide and for the West to, in a sense, stand by you.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m Not Responsible for Idiots\u2019 Asked to comment on the testimony of a former British soldier who volunteered to fight in Ukraine but quit after less than a day citing the terrifying conditions, the lack of supplies and the demand that foreign legion fighters sign indefinite contracts, Wallace noted that the issue was no responsibility of his. \u201cLook I\u2019m not responsible for idiots that come and give interviews on media, I\u2019m afraid. I can try and stop them, but there are also no doubt people who have come to help you, who are perfectly happy to stand and fight alongside you. If some idiot from Cardiff decides to give an interview. He\u2019s probably an idiot\u2026.We\u2019re trying to discourage people coming who, what we would call, are \u2018Walter Mittys\u2019 \u2013 people who are thrill seekers who haven\u2019t really been in the army, are probably failures, rather, than the army, but we\u2019ll see what we can do,\u201d Wallace observed. \u2018Doctored Clip\u2019 Commenting on a trailer of the prank call that was released Tuesday, a UK Defence Ministry source called it \u201cdoctored.\u201d Wallace spoke to The Telegraph last week to report that he had been targeted by a \u201cRussian imposter,\u201d and that the video call was \u201cproperly set up.\u201d He said he really believed that he had been speaking to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denes Shmygal, and but that he eventually \u201cgot suspicious and, after about eight, nine minutes\u2026terminated the call.\u201d An inquiry has been set to investigate the incident, Wallace said. Soon after Wallace disclosed the prank, Home Secretary Priti Patel said she too had been a victim of the pranksters. In a comment under their YouTube video with the Wallace conversation, Vovan and Lexus promised that the \u201cprank with Priti Patel\u201d would be released \u201csoon.\u201d Vovan and Lexus, real names Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov, are Russian radio hosts who have become notorious for staging interviews with Russian and foreign public figures, ranging from celebrities like Prince Harry, Monica Lewinsky, Billie Eilish and Elton John, to political leaders including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, and others. While their interviews typically include lighthearted and silly moments, like the time they convinced EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker that Kim Kardashian wanted a job in the Armenian Foreign Ministry, they also occasionally result in insights into major diplomatic and military issues. In 2019, for example, Elliot Abrams, a Trump administration official in charge of Washington\u2019s regime change strategy in Venezuela, told the pair that US plans did not include a direct invasion. Last year, a top Swedish diplomat revealed to the comedians that there was no unified position in Europe on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.

In response to Russia's special military operation to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" Ukraine, which the West keeps portraying as \u201cinvasion\u201d, NATO doubled its battlegroups on the alliance's eastern flank. In addition to existing battlegroups in the Baltic States and Poland, multinational NATO forces will be stationed in  Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. According to St\u00f8re, though, Norway will not reconsider its time-tested policy on military bases on the country's territory. Norway's landmark declaration on military bases from 1949 stipulates that the Nordic country shall never receive bases for foreign military forces on its territory in peacetime. In addition, Norway claims to have refrained from holding Allied exercises near the Russian border. \u201cI believe that the principles we have had for Allied exercises have served Norway, our neighbourhood, and NATO well,\u201d St\u00f8re said. This spring, the Norwegian parliament will decide on a new defence agreement with the United States. The agreement was entered into by the previous Solberg government in the spring of 2021, but will be presented for approval this spring. It may give the Americans the right to set up infrastructure at several Norwegian military bases, including Rygge, Sola, Evenes and Ramsund. Russia reacted strongly to the agreement, arguing it constituted a militarisation of Norway. Previously, Norway received forces from the US Marine Corps on a rotary basis. The V\u00e6rnes Air Station also serves as a storage base for the US Armed Forces as part of the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program-Norway. Despite criticism from the opposition parties, the government has stated that the agreement is not in conflict with Norwegian policy on military bases. Overall, Norwegian-Russian relations, which date back hundreds of years to the Viking Age, have over the recent decade years become increasingly fraught due to reciprocal military build-ups in the north, numerous military jet interceptions, spying accusations, and an overall harsher rhetoric that puts a strain on decades-long partnership.

Over half of the group agreed with the idea of sending military jets to the Ukrainian Army, and 30% thought Canada should dispatch its own military forces to Ukraine.Furthermore, 82% of vaccinated respondents felt that Canada should impose tougher sanctions on Russia even if it means they would have to suffer higher prices and slower economic growth at home.On the other hand, respondents who said they were unvaccinated seem to have differing opinions, with the majority (52%) saying they don\u2019t support any of the anti-Russian measures mentioned by the pollsters, and 75% saying they refuse to pay the price by having prices at home skyrocket.The poll also revealed how the two groups feel about the reasons for the conflict, with 88% of vaccinated respondents saying the repression of Russian speakers in the Donbass region does not justify Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine. The unvaccinated, however, are more split on the question, with 26% saying Russia\u2019s military operation is justified, 27% saying it isn\u2019t, and 35% saying they neither agree nor disagree with it.The vaccinated also say, almost unanimously (88%), that Russia is guilty of war crimes in Ukraine, while only 32% of unvaxxed respondents agree, and 42% say they don\u2019t believe it is happening at all.These results were collected using our unique random probability panel @probitinc#cdnpolihttps:\/\/t.co\/CzX8FsZT9QEKOS President Frank Graves said he found the poll results alarming, suggesting that vaccine refusers were \u201cmuch more sympathetic to Russia,\u201d and that it showcased the \u201chighly corrosive influences of disinformation.\u201d\u201cThis is definitely a new and bluntly insidious force that\u2019s contributing to polarization and disinformation and poor decision-making.

The POTUS was similarly accused of lying over the  laptop story and dismissing it as \u201cRussian disinformation\u201d by former Attorney General Bill Barr. \u201cAnd I was shocked by that\u201d, added Barr, who served under former President Donald Trump. Barr, who has been promoting his book One Damn Thing After Another, added: As to whether Joe Biden might face legal problems over the contents of the laptop, Barr acknowledged that the narrative could be \u201cpolitically problematic\u201d. \u201cFrom a political standpoint now that this is in people's consciousness, it had been suppressed up until now, obviously they have a hot potato and just to see how they handle it will be interesting\u201d, added Barr. On 18 March, Fox News underscored that the NYT's Hunter Biden story was being ignored by the established US media, such as CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and NBC. \"It was once routine that damning reports about the president published by The New York Times would lead nearly every news programme\u2026 That is no longer the case, at least under President Biden\u2026 Since Wednesday evening, the Times' report has received zero attention on the five major networks\". Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, found himself in the crosshairs in October 2020 after The New York Post first reported on the contents of a hard drive copied from a laptop that the US President's son purportedly left at a Delaware repair shop in 2019. The younger Biden faced scrutiny after information discovered on the Mac, dubbed \u201cthe laptop from Hell\u201d, shed light on his numerous and sometimes controversial business dealings, such as securing a spot in the Ukrainian gas company Burisma following the 2014 coup supported by the then Obama-Biden administration, and a dubious deal with a Chinese business tycoon with suspected ties to the Communist Party. Thus, in a May 2014 email, Burisma board adviser Vadym Pozharskyi ostensibly asked Joe Biden's son to \"use [his] influence\" to politically support the Ukrainian company. In another email, dated April 2015, Pozharskyi thanked the younger Biden for arranging a meeting with his father, then-US Vice President Joe Biden. The laptop was one of three that had purportedly been owned by Hunter Biden, but had fallen out of his possession. They all contained sensitive information, including emails revealing how Joe Biden's son leveraged his US government connections and, in many cases, incriminating photographs, videos, and communications sent by Hunter. The second laptop was seized by federal agents shortly after reports first surfaced regarding the contents of the first MacBook Pro. Contents leaked by the Daily Mail from a third laptop, still missing, revealed footage of a naked Hunter Biden seemingly doing drugs with a prostitute in a Las Vegas hotel room. The current POTUS has repeatedly insisted that he never had anything to do with his son's business dealings, while dismissing allegations against Hunter Biden as \"smears from [former US President] Donald Trump's henchmen\". In its report on 16 March about the ongoing federal probe into Hunter Biden's unpaid tax bills, the NYT said that when looking into the younger Biden's business dealings, certain emails had been examined by prosecutors. The outlet also noted that those emails were obtained by them from \"a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr Biden in a Delaware repair shop\". According to the newspaper, \"the email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation\". Previously, the NYT had claimed the New York Post story on the Hunter Biden laptop was unsubstantiated. After the U-turn by the outlet, several Republicans have called to hold US mainstream media and Big Tech companies accountable for hushing the story in 2020. House lawmaker Claudia Tenney (R-NY) called for an investigation into their actions, should the GOP take back Congress in the November 2022 midterms. *Facebook is an extremist organisation banned in Russia.

The companies cited potential humanitarian consequences for their departure from Russia \u2013 one of the biggest wheat exporters in the world, alongside Ukraine. While Russia will likely be able to sustain itself, the rest of the world might not, if agriculture giants withdraw from the country, WSJ reported, citing a managing director of the SovEcon research firm, Andrey Sizov. Wheat prices have already risen 30% since the start of the Kremlin's special military operation in Ukraine amid fears of disruptions of shipments, especially from Ukraine, as the nation's Black Sea coastline is currently blockaded by the Russian navy. If the world loses a major exporter, Russia, due to the exit of the agriculture companies, it could face serious food shortages, the magazine warned. Several American and Ukrainian organisations have called on major international companies to stop supplying goods to Russia, while some companies have declined. Cargill, pointing at potential consequences for global food-security, did, however, promise to scale back investment and some of what they characterized as non-critical operations in Russia, the WSJ said. Syngenta, a major producer of pesticide and seeds, also cited fears of potential food shortages as justification to continue its work in the Russian market, WSJ reported, citing anonymous sources. Several other companies, like ADM, Bunge, Viterra and Glencore said they would limit development of business in the country, but would not stop the practice. Germany's Bayer promised to withhold crop seed supplies to Russia in 2023 but only if the military conflict in Ukraine continues. Earlier, several pharmaceutical and consumer product companies, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson and AmerisourceBergen, said they would stop shipping non-essential goods to Russia, but would continue to deliver drugs for medical patients, citing humanitarian concerns and the essential nature of access to medicine.

McEldowney, who worked for Harris since she took office alongside President Joe Biden, will be replaced by her deputy Philip Gordon, the White House said Monday. Earlier, a Reuters report, citing an internal memo, claimed McEldowney referred to the need to \u201cfocus on some pressing personal matters\u201d. There is no clarity yet as to when the resignation will take effect, with the former ambassador to Bulgaria and one-time director of the State Department\u2019s Foreign Service Institute cited as saying she wasn\u2019t \u201crushing out the door\u201d. McEldowney is said to have advised President Joe Biden and VP Kamala Harris on a range of global issues, including the speedy withdrawal from Afghanistan, negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme, and the ongoing special operation launched by Russia to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine. In a statement, Harris was cited as praising McEldowney for her \u201cinvaluable counsel\u201d and \u201cexceptional talent, deep expertise, and leadership navigating complex challenges\u201d.

And the response was very clear, you're not going to be a NATO member, but publicly, the doors will remain open.Top Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky himself, have repeatedly reiterated the country\u2019s NATO aspirations. The ambitions even got incorporated into Ukraine\u2019s constitution in 2019 under then-President Petro Poroshenko. NATO itself appeared to have been welcoming towards such aspirations, formally recognizing them in the 2008 Bucharest Summit Declaration, when the bloc\u2019s members agreed the country would eventually become a member.The eastward expansion of the bloc, and Ukraine\u2019s proclaimed resolve to join it in particular, have been among the top security concerns repeatedly voiced by Russia. NATO, however, has effectively rejected discussing these issues, maintaining that no third party, and especially not Moscow, should have any say regarding anyone\u2019s aspiration to join the alliance.Moscow attacked the neighboring state last month following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia's eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

This mood has persisted for eight years, so I can\u2019t say that something is happening now new to me,\u201d he added.Despite Krylov's desire to refrain from making his views public, the military operation in Ukraine has had an impact on Saturday's fight card in London.The event's headliner, Moscow native Alexander Volkov, has been cleared to fight despite concerns that his previously-issued visa would be revoked amid an apparent crackdown on Russian athletes and sports teams - with the UFC even drafting in a heavyweight fighter to be on stand-by to face hometown fighter Tom Aspinall should the UK government rescind Volkov's visa.And while Krylov was unaffected, it wasn't the same for some members of his corner team.\u201cIt became a big problem for some of my cornermen,\u201d Krylov explained of the travel uncertainty.\"I was asked by the UFC to arrive as early as possible.\u00a0As soon as my visa was issued, I immediately flew out, on March 1 I was already here.\u00a0Because of this, the preparation plan got a little off, because I was supposed to have another week of training in Tver [in Russia].\u201cBut, in principle, here we were able to make up for all this.

Baru backed New Delhi\u2019s official response of not taking sides in the row in Eastern Europe. While addressing a CEO roundtable at the White House on Monday, Biden lauded the \u201cunited response\u201d to Russian military actions presented by NATO and the US\u2019 partners in the Pacific region. \u201cThe Quad is \u2014 with the possible exception of India being somewhat shaky on some of this. But Japan has been extremely strong, so has Australia, in terms of dealing with Putin\u2019s aggression.  We presented a united front throughout NATO and the Pacific\u201d, Biden added. He underlined that New Delhi\u2019s \u201cprimary focus on national security\u201d was served by its \u201cown economic development\u201d and maintaining \u201cpeace and stability\u201d in the neighbourhood. Moscow has been a reliably defence and strategic partner for New Delhi since the 1970s, and is a source of over 60 percent of its defence imports.  The security ties with Moscow have assumed even greater significance for New Delhi against the backdrop of its ongoing border standoff with China. In spite of enjoying close security and strategic ties with Beijing as well, Russia has continued to supply high-grade weaponry to India, most recently the S-400 surface-to-air missiles (which will reportedly be operational by April). According to reports, Indian companies are also stepping up their crude purchases from Russia, which has offered energy at cheaper prices on the back of Western sanctions against Moscow. On the other hand, India has stepped up its defence and energy procurements from the US over the last five years. India bought $3.4 billion worth of American armaments between 2016 and 2020, besides being designated as a \u201cmajor defence partner\u201d in 2018. India\u2019s Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri noted in parliament on Monday that New Delhi had bought around $13.5 billion in energy (crude, natural gas, and coal) from the US, also stating that crude volumes from the US could \u201crise significantly\u201d in coming months.  Around 7.3 percent of India\u2019s crude requirements were sourced from the US in March 2020-April 2021, Puri said. While India is also a member of theWashington-led Quad grouping (including Japan and Australia), it has refused to enter into a formal alliance with Washington and declined to side with the West on Ukraine. Before Biden\u2019s remarks, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki last week also asked India not to support Moscow.  Psaki, however, admitted that sourcing more Russian oil by India won\u2019t violate the US sanctions. \"But also think about where you want to stand when history books are written at this moment in time\u201d, the US official remarked.  Brahma Chellaney, a noted Indian strategic affairs expert, has also blasted Biden for describing India\u2019s response as \u201cshaky\u201d, as he criticised the lack of a forceful response from the Democrat administration towards the Ladakh border dispute. The Indian expert recalled that, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other Trump-era officials had \u201cno hesitation\u201d in blasting the \u201cChinese aggression against India\u201d. \u201cBut Biden hasn't said a word, and there have been only passing references by his officials to the aggression in the context of China's other actions\u201d, he added.  Russia says that the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), which has enlisted new members in the former Soviet Union\u2019s territory in five separate waves since 1990, is one of the primary reasons for its special military operation in Ukraine, announced on 24 February by President Vladimir Putin. Moscow has offered to put an end to its operation if Kiev enshrines a neutral status in its constitution, which is among the preconditions set by Russia.

Albright was one of the key architects of NATO's 78-day bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, which was launched on March 24, 1999 - exactly 23 years ago. In December, Russia sent the Biden administration security guarantee proposals in an effort to prevent NATO\u2019s further enlargement. However, Moscow said the US largely ignored its most critical demands including a guarantee to never allow Ukraine into NATO. Moscow, Nikovski added, was forced to undertake the special operation in Ukraine because the legitimate government was toppled with the help of the United States and others. Albright\u2019s role in US domestic politics was positive, he added, but the world, and particularly the Balkan region, will remember her for her aggressive and \"anti-civilizational\" policies. The role Albright played in the breaking away of Kosovo from Serbia showed the world that US foreign policy is unscrupulous, Nikovski said. Years afterward, he added, Albright admitted that the bombing campaign was illegal, but also claimed it was useful. The former diplomat said Albright\u2019s role as US Secretary of State in expanding NATO deserves wholehearted and deep condemnation given that her predecessor, James Baker, told Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand an inch eastward after the reunification of Germany. Nikovski served as Undersecretary in the Macedonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as Ambassador to Russia, Albania, and the United Kingdom before resigning over criticisms of the United States for allegedly interfering in the country\u2019s internal affairs. Albright moved from Czechoslovakia to the United States in 1948, where she would work as a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service and found the Albright Institute for Global Affairs at Wellesley College in addition to her public service.

They do not understand the motivations behind this pressure, that when such pressure is exerted - and this pressure is not on large entrepreneurs, not on big businesses, it is pressure on everyone - the society consolidates,\" the deputy chairman added.

The former Russian president added that authorities and business have different tasks. \"Those who are engaged in the country's management primarily focus on the interests of the whole country, on the interests of the people of Russia. Whoever is in charge of running their own business (this is a very important task), is in charge of only that. Therefore, thinking that by restricting Russian business they will somehow influence the authorities... that is absolutely senseless, it is just stupid, foolish.\" Medvedev noted that Western countries do not understand that Russians will \"stand up for the country, will be a guide to the policy of the country\" in this sort of situation. He added that \"such restrictions, deprivations, these only bring people together, consolidate people, not divide them. And that is their main miscalculation, this is the weakness of these foolish sanctions.\" Speaking to Sputnik and RT, Medvedev pointed out that Russia's special military operation in Ukraine proceeds as planned and will continue until goals of demilitarisation and 'de-Nazification are achieved.  The deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council stressed that the operation was kicked off primarily because the goals set by Moscow were not achieved diplomatically. On 24 February, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine after the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk that had been recognised by Moscow as independent few days prior, appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian provocations. In response to  Russia\u2019s operation, Western countries have imposed numerous packages of sanctions against Moscow, targeting Russian officials and entities, businesses, media, and financial institutions.

It has accumulated these over the past few years and they now make up almost half of its foreign reserves.Nonetheless, permitting yuan-dominated Russian reserves puts pressure on Beijing, the Finance Ministry noted earlier this month, adding that the West had been pressuring China to limit Russia\u2019s access to those reserves. All of the country\u2019s gold is kept at home, the regulator added.According to the Finance Ministry, Russia has a total of about $640 billion in reserves, of which some $300 billion has been frozen. Moscow could not have foreseen such a development, and the freeze essentially constitutes theft, Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week.After its dollar and euro reserves were frozen, Russia applied what the central bank described as tit-for-tat measures. The movement of capital was restricted, and the sale of securities by foreign investors was banned, as was the withdrawal of funds from the Russian financial system, among other measures taken. Essentially, the central bank said, it prevented \u201cunfriendly countries\u201d from receiving funds from Russia in an amount comparable to the Russian assets that had been frozen.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"},{"uuid":"241d99ff-6df1-4577-923b-cea0a0fa7263","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220327\/limited-hangout-will-western-media-finally-look-into-hunter-biden-biolabs-funding-story-1094234602.html","title":"'Limited Hangout': Will Western Media Finally Look Into Hunter Biden Biolabs-Funding Story?","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e6\/03\/1b\/1094235925_0:0:3072:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_4a5701538b9d830b50aca0062d959adc.jpg?source-sid=afp","subtitle":"The stories related to the contents of the US president's son, Hunter Biden's laptop have rarely received anything from the mainstream media but the label of \"conspiracy\" or \"Russian disinformation\".","content":"The Russian Defence Ministry was the first to point the finger at the US president's son, Hunter Biden, as one of those purportedly involved in financing alleged American biowarfare research in Ukrainian laboratories. On Friday, the Daily Mail rolled out a report, citing emails from the younger Biden's infamous laptop, that appeared to back the Russian ministry's assertions, unearthing details about how Hunter Biden allegedly used his leverage as a board member of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma to pour money into research of pandemic-causing pathogens in Ukraine. One might suggest that the move by the UK media outlet indicated the readiness of Western journalists to finally look into the long-dismissed allegations around Hunter Biden. But not everyone is so optimistic. The term \"limited hangout\" is used to describe the revelation of a portion of previously hidden information, which occurs when it is impossible to stick to the initial \"cover-up\" story, so that attention is drawn to it and the rest remains clandestine. Dankof pointed out that there have been other reports in Western alternative media that covered the story \"far more comprehensively, with a fair reference to specific Russian accusations and accompanying evidence\". What the Daily Mail did, he believes, is not about that, as comprehensive reporting from mainstream media outlets would prompt questions about the very core of the Western narrative. The reason for rolling out a \"limited hangout\", he suggests, was the remarks by Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland on the US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. In her exchange with Senator Marco Rubio on the subject, Nuland confirmed the existence of biolaboratories in Ukraine, but denied the Russian accusations of the labs being used for the creation of biowarfare agents. Independent journalist and writer Daniel Lazare also does not seem to be enthusiastic about the Daily Mail report, deeming it \"interesting but [far] from conclusive\". \"The Hunter Biden angle is fascinating, but sheds no light on the nature of such research\", he says. \"It's possible that the labs were engaged in biowar research, but such suspicions are still far from proven\". But Washington's official assurances that there was no biowarfare research in Ukraine is far from being persuasive as well, Lazare notes. \"Given all that, and given America's ample record of lying when it comes to WMDs, we can safely conclude that its assurances regarding the labs cannot be taken at face value and that the US should come clean before the appropriate international authorities\", he explains. \"That means making all relevant records public and submitting to public questioning concerning all aspects of the labs and their activities\". Hunter Biden, however, was not the only one to purportedly funnel money into the alleged bioweapons research in Ukraine. Some of the money for the Ukrainian biolabs was provided by the Pentagon, raising questions regarding how US taxpayer money is being used. Dankof notes that the decision to finance the Ukrainian laboratories instead of, say, channeling the money into important social issues is \"a more important policy and budgetary issue for all of the criminals in the Biden administration\". He also slams the \"supporters of this madness in both the GOP and the Democratic Party in Congress, and a servile mainstream media in the United States owned and staffed by the elite interests involved in this and in Bush's 'War on Terror' in the Middle East\". Had the mainstream media paid enough attention to the Hunter Biden laptop story earlier, much more damning details would have emerged, Dankof believes, listing \"the criminal enterprises of Hillary Clinton just since 2016 and those of Hunter's own father\". Aside from this, he notes, the media's more thorough look inside the contents of the \"laptop from hell\" would have \"guaranteed the re-election of Donald Trump, something the American Deep State and its assets in [the] media and social media would not permit to happen\". The Biden administration does not seem to eager to address the issue, even though two-thirds of Americans, according to a recent Rassmussen poll, believe that the story about Hunter Biden's laptop is \"important\" and warrants further investigation. The reasons behind the White House's reluctance for such an investigation, Dankof says, are similar to those mentioned above. \"It would begin an unraveling of the real story on Joe and Hunter Biden; the president isn't going to honestly talk about [it] with the American public because he's a crook, as is his son and a whole host of players in the Ukrainian affair since February of 2014 that threatens to engulf all of us in World War III\", he says. Moreover, he continues, the White House appears to be prepared to attack anyone not ready to agree with the official narrative - just like Washington shielded its views on other controversial events.  Among those who have already been attacked by the Western media over their disagreement with the mainstream view, Dankof referred to Tulsi Gabbard, whom Hillary Clinton once called a \"Russian asset\". Gabbard, for her part, had branded the then-Democratic candidate \"the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party\". Since Gabbard weighed in to voice concerns about the American biolabs in Ukraine, she has yet again been labeled a \"Russian asset\" and a traitor by a handful of US lawmakers, among them GOP Senator Mitt Romney and Congressman Adam Kinzinger. In light of the findings by the Russian Defence Ministry, the Kremlin said it will demand an explanation from the United States regarding Hunter Biden's alleged involvement in the financing of biological research in Ukraine, with China also urging Washington to clarify the story around the alleged bioweapons. According to Russia, the United States has been pouring money into biological research in Ukraine aimed at potentially creating bioweapons or looking into the spread of dangerous pathogens. Aside from Hunter Biden, the Russian Defence Ministry found the US Agency for International Development (USAID), George Soros' Open Society Foundations, and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention also financed the research, which took place in 31 laboratories across 14 settlements in Ukraine. Ukraine is not the only country to have hosted the US-funded biolabs, Russia said, noting that similar research was conducted in Georgia, Indonesia, Germany, Azerbaijan and many other nations across the globe. The United States has vehemently denied the allegations, calling them part of a disinformation campaign, but Under Secretary Victoria Nuland in early March happened to confirm the existence of biolaboratories, saying that the US was \"quite concerned\" that Russian troops might take over the facilities.

This was not the only off-script statement by the US president. On Saturday, Biden said that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"cannot remain in power\" - a remark that was also deemed by many as an indication of Washington's push for regime change in Russia. The White House was quick to walk the statement back, assuring that the United States has no strategy to change the regime in Russia.

The US and its western allies have maintained that establishing normal diplomatic and trade relations with the Taliban hinge on the group's ability to fulfil its commitments, including forming an inclusive cabinet, respecting women and human rights.  Russia, China and Pakistan have supported calls for greater engagement between the Taliban and the global community. Although both Russia and China are batting for deeper economic engagement with Kabul, both the governments have yet to recognise officially the group's claim to Afghanistan's leadership. The Taliban has yet to be recognised by any foreign government. Significantly, the Taliban's recent refusal to open schools for girls in spite of earlier pledges, was supported by Pakistan, whose Prime Minister Imran Khan defended \"tribal customs\" and said that the \"idea of human rights and women\u2019s rights is different in every society\". The US and other western nations, meanwhile, warned that the decision would \"harm\" Afghanistan's reputation and economic progress. Sahwney argues that the \u201cwestern idea of democracy and human rights\u201d has been \u201ccompletely rejected by Afghanistan as well as by both Russia and China among other countries in the region. Commenting on the ongoing international processes, Sawhney points out that the Russian military operation in Ukraine and subsequent western sanctions against Moscow have implications for the global order, including Afghanistan. The analyst further points out that extending the BRI, or China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), north into Afghanistan would only reinforce the \"vision\" of a Beijing-led \u201cAsia-Pacific architecture\u201d. Backed by Beijing, the BRI, or One Belt One Road (OBOR) is a set of existing and proposed connectivity and infrastructure projects aimed at bringing together the economies of Asia, Africa, Europe and other regions. A study in 2019 claimed that BRI could boost the global economy by $7 trillion per year by 2040, with more than 56 countries set to benefit. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a flagship project under BRI. The CPEC begins in China\u2019s Xinjiang province and extends to the port of Gwadar on Pakistan\u2019s Arabian Sea coast. Pakistan\u2019s Khan has said that CPEC is crucial for his country's economic growth. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held meetings with Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Interior Minister Siraj Haqqani during his Thursday visit to Kabul. Wang is the most senior Chinese statesman to have visited Afghanistan since the Taliban stormed to power last August. Wang expressed hope that the Taliban will keep working towards an \u201cinclusive\u201d government and \u201copposed foreign forces imposing political pressure and economic sanctions on Afghanistan at will\u201d. The Chinese Foreign Minister has also invited Muttaqi to the foreign ministers' meeting of Afghanistan's neighbouring countries, which Beijing is set host this month. Similar security assurances were given to Wang by Haqqani, who is one of the most influential figures in the Taliban government. In his meeting with Baradar, Wang said that he \u201cwelcomes\u201d Afghanistan\u2019s role in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Beijing was willing to extend the connectivity project from Pakistan into Afghanistan. According to the Taliban\u2019s foreign office spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi, Russia's special envoy Kabulov discussed \u201cpolitical, economic, transit and regional relations\u201d with the Taliban leadership.

No matter how sad it may sound, the sport cannot move without worthy competitors.\"FINA, which runs the championships, is one of increasingly few major sporting organizations not to have barred Russian and Belarusian athletes after a directive from the International Olympic Committee [IOC] encouraging federations to take action.The governing body has allowed Russians and Belarusians to compete under neutral status.The national swimming federations of Poland and Switzerland have threatened to boycott the championships if representatives from the nations are allowed to take part, and their counterparts in Norway have said they will be forming a coalition of Scandinavian countries following suit.The European Swimming League has said it will not be inviting athletes from the countries to its events in a ruling which\u00a0is\u00a0likely to include the European Championships in Munich in August.The Russian Paralympic Committee headed to the Paralympic Games before the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) decided to impose a ban a day before the event started on March 4.\"Conclusions should be made by the federations about the direction in which they want to develop sports and whether [IOC founder] Pierre de Coubertin wanted to see [this] when he initiated the organization of the Olympic Games, which were supposed to unite people,\" said\u00a0Rylov.Putin has also claimed that De Coubertin's principles have been \"distorted\" by the international sporting bans.Speaking at the opening ceremony of an alternative winter event to the Paralympics last week, the head of state called the exclusion of Russia and Belarus by the IPC\u00a0the \"height of cynicism\".Rylov lost his Speedo deal after attending\u00a0a Moscow concert marking the reunification of Crimea with Russia.The 100m and 200m backstroke\u00a0winner at the Tokyo Games was part of an estimated crowd of more than 100,000 people who gathered at the Luzhniki Stadium on Friday.Putin addressed the stadium under the banner \u2018For a World without Nazism\u2019, and Rylov joined his fellow athletes in wearing national team\u00a0kit emblazoned with the letter \u2018Z\u2019.The symbol which has been visible on Russian military\u00a0equipment during the Ukraine conflict and has become synonymous with support for Russian forces."},{"uuid":"2765fad6-c9ee-47df-92df-c1282c7f6d45","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220320\/us-suggested-turkey-send-its-s-400s-to-ukraine-to-help-kiev-tackle-russian-special-op-report-1094024217.html","title":"US Suggested Turkey Send Its S-400s to Ukraine to Help Kiev Tackle Russian Special Op: Report","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/104958\/98\/1049589807_0:0:3077:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_33ffaad0ce7d2d5c511e3a72a454fa18.jpg?source-sid=rian_photo","subtitle":"The S-400 issue has been a prickly topic in US-Turkish ties since Ankara inked a contract with Moscow for the supply of the Russian-made missile defence systems in 2017. Washington claims that the S-400s pose a threat to NATO and are incompatible with the alliance's military hardware, something that Turkey rejects. ","content":"Washington and Ankara discussed \"the unlikely possibility\" of Turkey delivering its Russian-made S-400 missile defence systems to Kiev's forces in order to help them fight Russian troops amid Moscow's ongoing special operation in Ukraine, according to Reuters. The sources added that the issue \"also came up briefly\" during US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman's visit to Turkey earlier in March. Reuters, in turn, reported that America's alleged suggestion regarding the S-400s was \"part of a wider discussion between Sherman and Turkish officials about how the United States and its allies can do more to support Ukraine and on how to improve bilateral ties\". The two's relations has been marred by the S-400 issue since Ankara and Moscow signed a contract in 2017 on the supply of Russian air defence systems to Turkey. Washington claimed that Ankara was not acting like a NATO member when it bought armaments from Russia, but the Turkish government argued it had the right to boost the nation's defences as it pleases, especially in light of the US stalling the sale of its Patriot air defence systems to Turkey. After Ankara refused to scrap the S-400 deal, the US imposed a number of economic sanctions on Turkey's defence sector and refused to hand over the fifth-generation F-35 fighters that Turkish authorities earlier paid for. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the White House's actions, but insisted on keeping and deploying the S-400 air defences. The sources' claims come after Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier this week that Moscow's special military operation to demilitarise and de\u00ad-Nazify Ukraine, launched on 24 February, is going as planned. In the south of Ukraine, the Russian armed forces took control of the Kherson region, as well as the towns of Melitopol and Berdyansk, also blocking the city of Mariupol. This enabled Russian troops to cut off the Ukrainian Army from the coast of the Sea of Azov and unite with Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) units in the Donbass region. In the eastern direction, the DPR's People's Militia liberated the town of Volnovakha, advancing on the settlements of Verkhnetoretskoye and Novoselovka-2. Forces of the Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) are also conducting an offensive on Kiev's forces, with Russian troops taking control of the town of Balakleya in the Kharkov region. The Russian Defence Ministry has repeatedly stressed that the special operation only targets Ukraine's military infrastructure and that civilians are not in danger.

Last week, Erdogan pointed out that Turkey receives about half of its natural gas from Russia, and that Russia helps Turkey build the Akkuyu nuclear power plant. The Turkish president also said that he intends to hold phone conversations with the presidents of Russia and Ukraine, Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week. The United States, the EU and the UK have imposed sanctions against Russia after Moscow launched a military operation in Ukraine on 24 February. Some $300 billion in Russian foreign exchange reserves abroad ended up being frozen as a result of these sanctions, while Russian businesses were thus forced to find alternatives to Western-sourced machinery and equipment, spare parts, services, and consumer goods. Russia's military operation in Ukraine was initiated following calls from Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics to protect their civilians amid intensified shelling by Ukrainian forces.

Last month, President Vladimir Putin recognised the independence of the LPR, but almost all of the world considers it to still be part of Ukraine.\u00a0Speaking to journalists on Sunday, Leonid Pasechnik said that he thought \u201cin the near future a referendum will be held in the republic, where people will exercise their absolutely constitutional right, and give their opinion with respect to joining Russia.\u201d The official added that he was \u201csomehow sure that\u2019s precisely the way it will be.\u201dCommenting on the possibility of such a vote in the LPR, Russian Senator Andrey Klishas said on Sunday that both Lugansk and Donetsk had the right to seek to join Russia unless such a move ran counter to their constitutions.However, Leonid Kalashnikov, who chairs the Russian Duma\u2019s committee on the Commonwealth of Independent States Affairs, Eurasian Integration and Relations with Compatriots, has warned that \u201cnow is not the right moment\u201d for holding a referendum in the republic. Kalashnikov argued that \u201cyou hardly need to bother with such questions when destiny is being determined on the frontline.\u201dBoth the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DPR) and the LPR declared independence in 2014 following a violent coup in Kiev. Both territories are predominantly Russian-speaking, and fears were growing at the time that nationalist elements in the new Ukrainian government would persecute ethnic minorities. Ukraine branded the two breakaway republics separatists and launched an \u2018anti-terrorist operation,\u2019 deploying its military to regain control, which resulted in a bloody war. The armed hostilities ended in February 2015 with the signing in the Belarusian capital of the so-called Minsk II peace agreement, brokered by Germany and France.The accord demanded that both the Ukrainian military and separatists cease fire and put an end to clashes, which had turned the region into a conflict zone. The document also called for major administrative and political reform in Ukraine as well as autonomy and local elections for the Donbass republics. However, the implementation of the agreement was stalled, with the two sides blaming each other for the lack of progress.In mid-February 2022, the DPR and LPR began reporting an uptick in Ukrainian artillery shelling \u2013 something which forced the Donbass republics to ask Russia for official recognition, as their respective leaderships claim. On February 21, Moscow recognized both republics as independent states, signing friendship treaties with Donetsk and Lugansk. However, parts of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions declared by the two republics as their own in their respective constitutions were still under Ukraine\u2019s control.On February 24, Putin launched a military offensive\u00a0in Ukraine. The Russian head of state insisted that the neighboring state had to be \u201cdemilitarized and denazified,\u201d claiming that far-right militias, which had permeated the Ukrainian government, were supposedly aiming to carry out a genocide of the Russian-speaking population of the Donbass. Ukraine and its allies dismissed Putin\u2019s allegations as a mere pretext, accusing Moscow of waging \u201cunprovoked\u201d aggression against a sovereign state."},{"uuid":"27a4c9a2-6f15-4d89-8953-bc80e8961047","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552832-ukraine-pleads-red-cross\/","title":"Ukraine pleads with Red Cross not to open office near its border in Russia","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6241934785f54003cb1f8411.jpg","subtitle":"The ICRC says it has no data on Kiev\u2019s \u201cforced evacuations\u201d claims and its office in Rostov-on-Don would help all people in need","content":"Ukraine has called on the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) not to open an office in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, located near its eastern border, so it doesn\u2019t support what Kiev claims is the \u201cabduction\u201d and \u201cforced deportation\u201d of Ukrainians to Russia.The ICRC, commenting on Kiev's appeal on Sunday, told Reuters it had no first-hand information about reports of forced evacuations to Russia from Ukraine and did not facilitate any such operations.

Russia ended up recognizing the two as independent states, at which point they asked for military aid.Russia demands that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

As the current situation in Ukraine unfolds, they may return this equipment to the eastern European nation.","content":"The United States will reportedly transfer Soviet-made air defense weapons it obtained decades ago to bolster the Ukrainian military's arsenal amid the Kremlin's ongoing special military operation, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. Citing undisclosed sources within the government, the report details that the systems, which include the SA-8 Gecko (9K33 Osa in Russian designation), are decades old and were obtained by the US to assess Soviet military technology that was sold around the world. Officials are reported to have asserted that the armaments are known to the Ukraine military, which inherited the same type of equipment after the Soviet Union collapsed.  The United States, it is alleged, will tap into its arsenal of Soviet weapons, as the Biden administration pushes to provide Ukraine with more weapons to defend itself. According to the outlet, a Soviet-made cargo aircraft flew to a Huntsville, Alabama, airport in 1994, carrying an S-300 air defense system that the US had obtained in Belarus as part of a $100 million clandestine effort involving a Pentagon contractor. Some Soviet-made weapons were reportedly held at the Redstone Arsenal in Alabama, which serves as \"the Army's center for missile and rocket programs.\" The sources indicated that at least some of what the US may provide for Ukraine's defense will come from that location. However, according to unnamed sources, the Belarus S-300 is not among the systems being provided to Ukraine. The annual government spending bill recently passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden reportedly includes clauses authorizing the transfer of aircraft, ammunition, vehicles, and other equipment to the Ukrainian military and NATO partners that are already overseas or in existing stockpiles. Staffers for Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, who pushed for the language, reportedly told the outlet that the revised legislation would also include Soviet-era air defense systems. Sources said Congress is informed of the US decision.  The S-300 Russian air defense system is already present in the Ukraine arsenal, but it is asserted by Kiev that its military needs more of missiles that operate at medium and long ranges. The shoulder-fired Stinger missiles continuing to be provided to Ukraine by the US and NATO countries are only effective against helicopters and nearby low-flying aircraft. The S-300, aka SA-10 under the NATO designation, is a long-range, modern air defense system designed to protect large territories over a considerably wider radius. The SA-8 is a tactical air defense system with a limited range that can move with ground units and provide cover against airplanes and helicopters. While the SA-8 has a lesser range, it is more maneuverable and may be easier to hide, according to military experts. According to the report, given that Kiev has repeatedly urged the West to create a no-fly zone over the country in the face of the unconditional superiority of the Russian air force, by this move the US hopes that Ukraine would be able to construct a de facto no-fly zone of its own. Both the US and a majority of NATO member states have rejected Kiev's request for a no-fly zone, as the move is feared to be perceived as a direct intervention in the ongoing military conflict and an escalation that could lead to nuclear war.  The Kremlin has repeatedly warned that it will consider NATO's attempts to introduce a no-fly zone as direct participation in the conflict, with ensuing consequences. Officials in the Biden administration have warned that taking such a step could lead to a direct conflict between the US-led alliance and Russia, something the US and the rest of the world is keen to avoid. Russia has repeatedly denounced sending lethal weapons into Ukraine as an escalation of the Kremlin's special military operation. During the ongoing military operation, Russian troops and the republics in Donbass regularly discover Western missiles and ammunition abandoned by the Ukrainian army and units of nationalists in settlements they leave behind.

And secondly, as we evacuate civilians, they try to escape disguised as civilians, to our side here, to blend in somewhere and get away,\u201d Kokarev said. Kokarev reported multiple cases of attempts by militants to escape in women's clothing. Kokarev said suspected Ukrainian troops and National Guard fighters are questioned and sent to the proper authorities for further questioning after being caught. \u201cOur boys do a good, nice job. So, victory is ours, we will win,\u201d Kokarev stressed. The footage of a captured Ukrainian serviceman dressed in women\u2019s clothing being taken out of the back of a military truck in Mariupol is reminiscent of videos from the conflict in Syria, where Syrian Army and Kurdish forces repeatedly reported cases of terrorist fighters trying to flee the battlefield dressed as women in head-to-toe burkas, or attempting to blend in with civilians by shaving their trademark beards en masse. The battle for Mariupol has become one of the deadliest in the course of the ongoing Russian military operation in Ukraine, with Russian and Donbass forces engaging Ukrainian troops and the Azov neo-Nazi militants in house-to-house fighting amid attempts by the latter to hide in residential areas, and in the Azovstal iron and steel works.  Mariupol was estimated to have had as many as 400,000 residents before the fighting began, with Donetsk People\u2019s Republic head Denis Pushilin saying Wednesday that 150,000 civilians remain trapped in the city in areas controlled by nationalist formations. Russian and DPR troops are said to control about half of the city. On Tuesday, the Russian military called the humanitarian situation in the city \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d and said that over 68,000 people had evacuated from the conflict zone without the Ukrainian government\u2019s involvement. Earlier, DPR officials accused Kiev of deliberately trapping civilians in the city.

Medinsky elaborated that the position of Kiev will be reviewed by Moscow and presented to President Vladimir Putin. After that, the Kremlin will give its response on whether it agrees to include Kiev's propositions in a final agreement between Russia and Ukraine, the negotiator explained. Medinsky said that the Russian delegation is leaving Istanbul on 29 March and that further negotiations between Ukraine and Russia will continue via video conferences for now. The Russian chief negotiator also announced Moscow's plans to take military and political de-escalation steps. The military de-escalation will take the form of a \"significant reduction\" of military activities in the Kiev and Chernigov directions. The political de-escalation step suggests the possibility of a personal meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents at the stage of preliminary approval of the final version of the agreement. The Russian Defence Ministry explained the decision to de-escalate the military situation by the fact that negotiations on Ukraine's neutral and non-nuclear status, as well as security guarantees for the country, have become more \"practical\". The ministry stated that the step was necessary to increase a level of mutual trust in negotiations and ultimately to sign an agreement. The head of the Russian delegation later noted that military de-escalation does not entail a ceasefire in the Kiev and Chernigov directions. At the same time, he noted that Russia understands that decision-makers are located in Kiev and thus does not want to put Kiev at greater risk. Medinsky, in turn, said that Presidents Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky could discuss political details of the agreement when they meet for the initialling of the agreement. During the previous rounds of talks, the delegations only managed to agree on opening humanitarian corridors to evacuate citizens from Ukrainian cities where the country\u2019s military and nationalist battalions were fighting troops of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR), as well as Russian forces taking part in the special military operation. The latter was launched on 24 February by Putin in response to a request from the DPR and LPR to defend them against continued attacks by Kiev's forces. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Putin has warned that any such move, which would require Western states\u00a0to police the zone, would be viewed as participation in the military conflict, with all that implies.\u00a0Biden's officials have rejected the idea and said that providing fighter jets to Ukraine would pose a \u201chigh risk\u201d of escalating the war.Beyond the implications of a direct NATO military confrontation with Russia, there are other challenges to providing Zelensky with the weapons he wants. UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace pointed out on Saturday that Ukraine\u2019s military isn\u2019t set up to use the most advanced Western weapons.\u201cOne of the biggest challenges is that the more you go up in sophistication of weapons systems, the more training you require to use them, which is why the real focus of effort has to be on helping the Ukrainians either refurbish or locate Russian or Soviet equipment that is already in their inventory,\u201d Wallace told the UK\u2019s Daily Mail newspaper. \u201cJust providing British tanks wouldn\u2019t really work.\u201dHowever, Wallace said, British-made anti-aircraft equipment \u2013 shoulder-mounted Starstreak missiles that can shoot down low-flying warplanes \u2013 would be provided to Ukraine.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

Citing the evidence from emails obtained from the notorious abandoned laptop of the president's son, the outlet reported that he helped secure millions of dollars of funding for Metabiota, a Department of Defense contractor specializing in research on pandemic-causing diseases that could be used as bioweapons. Biden also introduced Metabiota to an allegedly corrupt Ukrainian gas firm, Burisma, for a \"science project\" involving high biosecurity level labs in the Eastern European nation. According to the report, Metabiota is a medical data company, but its vice president wrote Hunter in 2014 to discuss how they could \"assert Ukraine's cultural and economic independence from Russia,\" thus giving rise to speculation about the company's goals. Hunter may have reportedly played a key role in ensuring Metabiota was able to perform pathogen research close to the Russian border, according to emails and defense contracts obtained by the outlet. The younger Biden and his colleagues at Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners (RSTP), an investment firm he purportedly owned, consistently raised millions of dollars for technology companies, and Metabiota was not an exception. Hunter and his coworkers reportedly exchanged emails about how the company's medical data monitoring may become a crucial tool for governments and businesses attempting to spot infectious disease outbreaks. However, Hunter was also allegedly heavily involved in Metabiota's activities in Ukraine. In Hunter's April 2014 investor pitches, he reportedly stated that they not only helped the company receive financing, but also helped \"get new customers,\" including \"government agencies in the case of Metabiota.\" The company's vice president, Mary Guttieri, wrote a memo to Biden, outlining the unexplained goal of moving Ukraine closer to the West, according to the report. Guttieri also reportedly played a key role in Metabiota's Ukraine operations, meeting with other company executives and US and Ukrainian military officials in October 2016 to discuss \"cooperation in surveillance and prevention of especially dangerous infectious diseases, including zoonotic diseases in Ukraine and neighboring countries.\" According to the Daily Mail, Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi responded to Hunter four days after Guttieri's April 2014 email, indicating that the vice president's son had presented a \"science project\" involving Burisma, on whose board of directors he served, and Metabiota in Ukraine. Pozharskyi purportedly asked Biden to take a look at \"few initial points\" of the purposes to look into \"the potential of this as you called, 'Science Ukraine' project.\" Pozharskyi claimed in an email to Hunter that B&amp;V had worked on \"similar or the same projects\" as the proposed contract for Metabiota and that he had known several of such biological research projects in his previous role as a Ukrainian government official. The outlet quoted US government expenditure records, which mentioned that Metabiota was awarded a $18.4 million contract by the Department of Defense between February 2014 and November 2016, with $307,091 allotted for \"Ukraine research projects.\"  In 2010, the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency purportedly commissioned B&amp;V to build a Biological Safety Level 3 laboratory in Odessa, Ukraine, which \"provided enhanced equipment and training to effectively, safely and securely identify especially dangerous pathogens.\" Such labs are reportedly used to \"study infectious agents or toxins that may be transmitted through the air and cause potentially lethal infections.\" On Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia will demand explanations about the involvement of the younger Biden in biological laboratories in Ukraine. Peskov stressed that the issue of biological laboratories in Ukraine is \"very sensitive information - both for us and for the whole world.\" He also noted that in addition to Russia, China also demanded an explanation of Hunter's connection with these biological laboratories. The Kremlin spokesman suggested that the US is trying to divert attention by alleging that Russia would use chemical weapons, which Moscow vehemently denied. New data sharply raises the question about \"what the Americans were doing in Ukraine and what could happen because of all this research.\" Let's stay in touch no matter what!

","content":"Mariupol resident Nina Kulayeva has told Sputnik that scores of people died after neo-Nazis from Ukraine's Azov Regiment deliberately destroyed the Neptune swimming pool in the centre of the southeastern coastal city currently surrounded by Russian and Donetsk People's Republic forces. The woman suggested that by obliterating the pool, members of the Azov Regiment apparently wanted to intimidate the local population. According to Kulayeva, it was Azov militants who blew up a drama theatre in Mariupol earlier this week. Russia Rejects Allegations of Bombing Mariupol Theatre  She spoke after Ukrainian authorities earlier accused the Russian military of carrying out an airstrike on the Mariupol Drama Theatre on 16 March. The Russian Ministry of Defence rejected the accusations, stressing that its aviation \"did not implement any tasks regarding strikes on ground targets\" in Mariupol. The ministry earlier accused the Azov detachment of using heavy Grad artillery to strike residential areas and a school on the outskirts of Mariupol, which killed multiple civilians. Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of the Russian National Defence Control Centre, has since said that Moscow informed Kiev that it is ready to let militants leave Mariupol via humanitarian corridors to save the city and its civilians. He added that Russia is ready to give guarantees to militants that they will not be harmed if they lay down their arms. Mariupol has been the site of intense fighting between the forces of Ukraine and the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) in recent weeks. On 7 March, DPR forces said that they had encircled the city and started clearing it of Ukrainian troops and extremist battalions, including the Azov Regiment. According to a Sputnik correspondent, there was no electricity in the city on Friday, while the population has run out of provision as there are no food supplies. In addition, almost all of the stores are either destroyed or have been looted, the correspondent added. On 24 February, Moscow launched a special military operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine after weeks of escalating shelling, sabotage, and sniper attacks by Ukrainian forces against the Donbass republics, whose predominantly Russian-speaking population has been subjected to \"abuse and genocide [\u2026] for eight years\", according to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Moscow has repeatedly stated that the goal of the operation is to neutralise Ukraine's military capacity and not harm the civilian population of the country. The Azov Regiment, formed in 2014 as a group of neo-Nazi volunteer paramilitaries and infamous for their 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich-style rune logo, has since been integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard.

He added that the documents also showed that the US Defence Department funded the biological research in Ukraine, spending over $200 million to study pathogens of birds, bats, and reptiles in Ukraine and the possibility of transmission of African swine fever and anthrax through these animals. US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland previously admitted that \"Ukraine has biological research facilities\", saying that Washington was \"working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach\". She, however, did not elaborate on whether Washington took part in the biological research in Ukraine. Russia started a special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February in response to calls from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics for protection against intensifying attacks by Ukrainian troops. The Russian Defence Ministry said the operation is only targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure and the civilian population is not in danger. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

In a recent episode of his show \"The Joe Rogan Experience\", Rogan recalled the screenshot that \"someone sent me\" about the US media coverage of Ukraine before the current conflict. Rogan termed Ukraine \"the most corrupt nation in Europe,\" with a \"increasingly corrupt and authoritarian leader\" attempting to deepen an \"alliance with the far-right,\" as he read off headlines from a screenshot. The publications in question came from the World Socialist Web Site, the right-wing Cato Institute, and the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN. Rogan also verbally attacked Big Tech corporations like Meta's Facebook* and other social media platforms for permitting violent speech toward the Russian government and its military, in addition to condemning the media for changing its narrative on Ukraine.  The Russian court has recently labeled Meta as an extremist organization for allowing the calls for violence against Russians during the Kremlin's ongoing special military operation across Ukraine. In 2017, the New York Times reported on a policy pursued by the previous Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, to \"whitewash\" World War II Ukrainian nationalists who openly collaborated with Nazi occupation authorities in the mid-20th century and displayed anti-Semitism and direct participation in Nazi crimes against humanity. The article, written by the head of the Ukrainian Jewish Committee, went on to highlight how neo-Nazis frequently desecrated Holocaust memorials and places in Ukraine, as historical revisionism of that country's dark past has ramped up to whitewash not only Ukrainian nationalists, but the conduct of the remaining modern neo-Nazis. In 2018, the Atlantic Council published a report on known far-right groups in Ukraine that rose to prominence after the 2014 coup d'\u00e9tat. In 2018, according to the report, C14* and other far-right groups such as the Azov-affiliated National Militia, Right Sector*, Karpatska Sich*, and others \"have attacked Roma groups several times, as well as anti-fascist demonstrations, city council meetings, an event hosted by Amnesty International, art exhibitions, LGBT events, and environmental activists.\" \"Whether this is due to a continuing sense of indebtedness to some of these groups for fighting the Russians or fear they might turn on the state itself, it\u2019s a real problem and we do no service to Ukraine by sweeping it under the rug,\" the analyst center stated.

","content":"Officials at the US Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection and other agencies are bracing for another migrant influx in the upcoming months. Last year\u2019s record-breaking immigration rates prompted an outcry from GOP officials and lawmakers, who blame the current administration\u2019s eased border policies for the spike in migration. Tucker Carlson pulled no punches over the Biden administration's southern border policy. He cited figures across the American southwest that show an increase in crime and instability. He blamed the current administration for the increased crime rate not only in Houston but in other cities in Texas and other states \u201cwhere millions of illegal aliens have flooded in during Joe Biden's presidency.\u201d Carlson also mentioned another issue that has become a source of constant criticism from Republicans \u2013 fentanyl overdoses, which, last year, surpassed heroin overdoses. Fentanyl, an easily produced synthetic opioid, has been one of the main drugs trafficked from Mexico into the United States and has accounted for over 100,000 deaths and 64% of all drug overdoses in the US. Carlson attacked Democrat lawmakers, who are calling for the abolition of Title 42, a Trump-era law that empowers the authorities to extradite illegal immigrants due to pandemic concerns. Earlier in the week, authorities were preparing to encounter 170,000 immigrants over the upcoming months if Biden decides to stop extraditions under Title 42, with DHS calling on its workers to volunteer at the southern border. Illegal immigration traditionally peaks seasonally in the spring and early summer. Historically, the month of May sees the most illegal border crossings.   Meanwhile, US Border Patrol agents reported 164,973 encounters with migrants stopped from illegally crossing the southern border in February, which is a 63 percent increase compared to the same period last year. Nevertheless, it is less than the 20-year record of 212,000 encounters, reported by the DHS in June last year. Carlson claimed that the US military can be used to solve the problem of \u201copen borders\u201d and stop the \u201cinvasion.\u201d He criticized the decision to send \u201cthousands of American troops and billions in American military hardware to Eastern Europe to help Ukrainians restore their borders,\u201d wondering \u201cwhy not here.\u201d Since the start of the Russian military operation on February 24, Washington has announced plans to deploy additional troops to Eastern European NATO members.  The Pentagon has already sent approximately 7,500 soldiers along with military equipment to Poland, Romania, Germany, and the Baltic States \u201cto respond to the current security environment in light of Russia's renewed aggression against Ukraine\u201d and to bolster the alliance\u2019s eastern frontiers.

The budget presentation was the last for Prime Minister Scott Morrison's Liberal coalition government, which faces a tough re-election in May.","content":"Australia on Tuesday announced its \u201clargest-ever investment\u201d in bolstering the country\u2019s cyber and intelligence capabilities, as it unveiled a $7.43 billion (9.9 billion AUD) investment over the next 10 years to bolster the size and capabilities of the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD). \u201cREDSPICE will substantially increase ASD\u2019s offensive cyber capabilities, its ability to detect and respond to cyber-attacks, and introduce new intelligence capabilities\u201d, Dutton stated. Dutton\u2019s apparent reference was to China, , which has accused the US and its Pacific allies such as Australia of \"inciting\" an arms race in the region through the activities of groupings such as AUKUS and Quad (comprised of Australia, India, Japan, and the US). \"It acknowledges the nature of conflict has changed, with cyberattacks now commonly preceding other forms of military intervention \u2013 most recently demonstrated by offensive cyber activity against Ukraine\", Dutton also remarked. The federal budget presented by Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg also committed an approximately $431 billion (575 billion AUD) outlay to ramp up Canberra's defence capabilities by the end of the decade. As per the budget papers, around half a trillion dollars in investments will go into upgrading Canberra's defence capabilities and infrastructure, besides expanding the size of the Australian Defence Forces (ADF) to around 18,500 by 2040. Australia has announced a plan to construct at least three new bases along its eastern coast to station the advanced nuclear-attack submarines (SSNs) it is expected to develop thanks to British or US technologies under the AUKUS arrangement. The announced budget also includes funding for acquiring \"new uncrewed aerial surveillance systems, Ch-47F Chinook helicopters, Abrams tanks, and combat engineering vehicles\", as per Dutton. \"The government will also upgrade and extend in-service support for the Hawk 127 Lead-In Fighter Training System that will result in a $ 1.2 billion (AUD 1.5 billion) investment in the Air Force\u2019s future aviation capability\", the minister said. Dutton said that the expanded Australian defence force would \u201cenable us to deliver our nuclear-powered submarines, ships, aircraft and advanced weapons\u201d. Prime Minister Morrison said that the investments announced in the budget would increase Canberra's defence spending past 2 percent of its overall gross domestic product (GDP). In comparative terms, the US is by far the world's biggest defence spender, with its current budgetary outlay exceeding $750 billion. While China is the second biggest defence spender, it spends almost three times less than the US in military expenditures. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

If our girls took to the ice, she would have no chance of winning first place.\"Top Russian skaters such as Beijing 2022 team event gold medalist Kamila Valieva plus women's singles event gold and silver medalists Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova are absent from the ongoing World Championships in France due to an ISU ban on Russian athletes\u00a0imposed\u00a0in response to\u00a0the military operation in Ukraine.\u00a0While Tarasova said that\u00a0Sakamoto \"did everything cleanly\"\u00a0to lead the way in her short program, she described the Japanese star's routine as a\u00a0\"skate\u00a0from 20 years ago\".\"All the elements were done, but there were no elements of the highest complexity, and our girls strive and do the highest complexity, [to] develop in technical perfection,\" Tarasova said, with there also no triple axels performed by any of the women in France, unlike the Russian elite such as Valieva.Tarasova said that Russian skaters, had they been allowed to compete, would have been \"the first everywhere.\"\"The Japanese [girl] skated well, but this is not a high level, of course,\" Tarasova balked.Tarasova's comments are backed by Olympic bronze medalist Sakamoto leading the short program with a score of 80.32, which though 5.32 points clear of second-placed Belgian Loena Hendrickx is still paltry compared to the numbers that top Russian skaters produce.In recent months, Valieva set a world record\u00a090.45 short program tally at the European Championships in January, which broke her own previous world record of\u00a087.42 at the\u00a0Rostelecom Cup last November.Tarasova has also fired back at Canadian journalist Beverley Smith who tweeted that \"though were no triple Axels to be seen,\"\u00a0the short program was a\u00a0\"sane\" event compared to the \"crazy drama at the Olympics,\"\u00a0where Valieva was caught up in a doping scandal due to a failed drug test from the Russian Championships on December 25 that did not surface until after the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) had won the Team event in Beijing.\"Sigh of relief: no Russian skaters or judges.

It instead accused Ukraine of being the culprit.The rebuke came in response to Zelensky\u2019s Wednesday address to the Norwegian parliament, during which the Ukrainian leader accused the Russian military of \u201ccreating the worst threat to international security since World War II\u201d through its \u201cinsidious\u201d operations in the Black Sea.\u201cAbout a hundred ships cannot leave to the Mediterranean. Some ships have been simply seized in acts of piracy aimed at stealing the cargo. Some ships were attacked,\u201d Zelensky said.\u201cBut the blockade of the ports was done by Russia not only through use of naval forces. They have deployed mines in the sea. And now the mines set up by the Russian forces are drifting in the sea. They pose a threat to anyone, to ships and ports of every nation in the Black Sea region.\u201dMining its shores and territorial waters has long been part of Ukraine\u2019s strategy of defending against a Russian attack from the Black Sea, which it started implementing after the hostilities broke out. On March 5, its armed forces warned residents of the Odessa region to stay away from the sea because of the mines being deployed by the military.\u201cWe call on fishermen and owners of boats not to move near the shore of the Odessa region to avoid the risk of being fired upon or contacting mine barriers,\u201d the message said.According to the Russian defense ministry, Ukraine deployed some 420 old YaM-1 moored naval mines along its shores, including 370 in the Black Sea. About ten of them went adrift after their cables snapped during a storm earlier this month, the Russian military believes.At least two apparent mines were reported found and have since been destroyed: one by the Turkish military and one in Romanian territorial waters. \u201cNobody knows where the rest of them are drifting,\u201d the Thursday statement said, adding that Kiev\u2019s mining operations created a major threat to shipping in the Black Sea.The Russian ministry said that the second charge voiced by Zelensky during his video address was likewise \u201ca lie\u201d.

Bush when the prime minister was in the best position to mitigate the headlong rush into war. Now, the role of enabler in the conflict ginned up by NATO against Russia in Ukraine goes to French President Emmanuel Macron. And it\u2019s the people of Europe \u2013 including French citizens who are set to head to the polls on April 10 and 24 to decide whether Macron deserves a second five-year presidential mandate \u2013 who are on the verge of realizing just how much Macron\u2019s kowtowing to the US is going to personally cost them.In February 2019, Foreign Policy magazine claimed that \u201cMacron is going full De Gaulle,\u201d and that, \u201cFrance\u2019s president is pushing around Britain, Germany, and Italy \u2013 and going back to his country\u2019s foreign-policy roots.\u201d\u00a0If it truly had been the case that Macron was acting like the legendary French president and former World War II era General Charles de Gaulle, then Macron would have stood up to the US as it pushed its NATO allies to arm and train Ukrainian fighters while recklessly and flagrantly ramping up antagonism and belligerence towards Russia.President de Gaulle was so incensed by Washington\u2019s willingness to have France\u2019s armed forces come under US-led NATO collective control that he pulled Paris out of the integrated military command in 1966, at the very height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union that represented the military alliance\u2019s entire raison d\u2019\u00eatre. De Gaulle shuttled between Moscow and Washington afterwards, armed with the credibility of having rejected strict alignment with either global superpower, and thereby allowing him to act as a truly honest and independent broker on both sides of the Iron Curtain. To further underscore France\u2019s total independence, de Gaulle ratified a foreign affairs, science, and technology cooperation agreement that same year with the Soviet Union, which set France on a divergent course from its Western allies.\u00a0But in 2009, French President Nicolas Sarkozy reintegrated France into NATO, and Macron has been trying to regain France\u2019s previous reputation as a truly independent broker between Moscow and Washington. He even tried to reorient NATO\u2019s strategic objectives by calling it \u201cbrain dead\u201d and emphasizing that it should redefine its focus to counterterrorism missions. Macron has also advocated in favor of the Gaullist position of Europe as an independent world power unto itself.But recent actions speak much louder than Macron\u2019s words. And it didn\u2019t start with the Ukraine conflict. Last year, the Australian government canceled a \u20ac50 billion submarine acquisition contract with France, with Washington being the ultimate beneficiary, as President Joe Biden announced that a new China-targeting alliance would include Australia, Britain, and the US, with France excluded despite having significant overseas territories in the region.\u00a0Despite various French experts suggesting that Macron should have responded to the costly snub by pulling France out of US-led NATO, Macron instead settled for undefined future American help in the Sahel region of Africa.\u00a0Today, the current value of that US offer is questionable in the wake of France\u2019s withdrawal from Mali.\u00a0So what net gain did Macron secure for France in exchange for shrugging off Washington\u2019s screw-over of the French economy? Not much.Likewise, in the run-up to the Ukraine conflict, Macron should have known better than to follow along with Washington\u2019s dangerous game. He had every opportunity to adopt an independent stance amid Washington\u2019s arming, training, and supporting of Ukraine and its brazenly anti-Russian stance that had already resulted in sanctioning the Russian-German Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline construction to the detriment of 40% of Europe\u2019s gas supply.As holder of the six-month rotating Council of Europe presidency, Macron sat on his hands and zipped his mouth as the EU attempted to crush Russia with sanctions, blocked Moscow\u2019s foreign reserves, and cut it off from the global banking system. He then stood idly by while the EU quashed media outside of the heavily state-subsidized or corporate-consolidated press, thereby reducing the chance that light would be shined on the potential nefarious consequences for the French people of such actions.\u00a0Now, with Russia asking Europe to pay for gas in rubles in the wake of the financial difficulties imposed on it by the West, Macron has decided to react. He told Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call this week \u201cthat it was not possible for Western gas clients to pay their bills in roubles,\u201d according to Reuters.\u00a0With Russian gas used in France for everything from industrial production to car fuel, Macron is now in a race against time. Will the French people re-elect him in April before or after they realize how badly Macron\u2019s failure to stand up to America has effectively sanctioned French citizens? Earlier this week, Macron announced a proposal for \u201cfood vouchers to help the most modest households and the middle class families to cope with the additional costs\u201d due to sanctions and war-related inflation of food and gas costs.What\u2019s next? Bread lines and rationing? These sanctions clearly don\u2019t benefit the French people, so why did Macron not dial down the belligerence by standing up to Washington when it was cheerleading Ukrainians as proxies for its anti-Russian belligerence? He should have known from the submarine deal screw-over that Washington is always looking out for itself, even if it\u2019s to the detriment of Europe.It\u2019s still not too late for Macron to make his mark on history in the way that de Gaulle did. He could publicly call on the EU to drop all Russian sanctions in light of the harm they are causing his own citizens and industry, and push Ukraine and Russia together to work out their issues while refusing to support or encourage any further NATO belligerence or interference. Doing so would represent a truly courageous and independent stance by Macron in favor of peace, French leadership, and European independence at a time when the world needs it most."},{"uuid":"3132a218-c79b-40cd-b134-a358b433a1df","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220331\/russia-blacklists-eus-leadership-1094364898.html","title":"Russia Blacklists EU's Leadership","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e5\/06\/0a\/1083113340_0:0:3072:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_35cd0e1b144ad46c3482d4688b727289.jpg?source-sid=rian_photo","subtitle":"In recent weeks, the European Union has joined US allies in introducing wave after wave of sanctions against Russian officials, businesses,  tycoons and economic sectors over the crisis in Ukraine, turning Russia into the world's most sanctioned nation.","content":"Moscow has blacklisted the EU's top leadership and other officials, lawmakers, media and public figures, barring them from entering Russia to reciprocate for the bloc's sanctions, anti-Russian policies and sentiments. In a statement released Thursday, the Russian Foreign Ministry specified that the blacklist includes representatives of governments and parliaments of some EU member states, EU commissioners and heads of EU military structures, certain public figures and talking heads in the media who have been pushing sanctions and inciting Russophobic attitudes, and \"the vast majority of the members of the European Parliament who promote anti-Russian policies\". \"In trying to portray our country as the culprit of the systemic European security crisis, Brussels' euro-bureaucrats have refused to acknowledge that, over the years, they have condoned the strengthening of Russophobic and neo-Nazi sentiments in Ukraine, the country's militarisation and integration into NATO for the purposes of containing Russia. Notwithstanding our repeated appeals, they have indulged the regime in Kiev in sabotaging the Minsk Agreements and the suffocation of Russian-speaking people in Ukraine. They turned a blind eye to the systematic extermination of civilians in the Donbass,\" the ministry added. The Foreign Ministry indicated that a note outlining the blacklisting has been handed to the office of the EU Delegation in Moscow. \"We reaffirm that any hostile actions on the part of the EU and its member states will inevitably continue to be met with a harsh response,\" it said. The measure follows a similar move by Moscow to put top US officials - including President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others - on a \"stop list\" earlier this month. That move was also taken in retaliation to US sanctions, including the blacklisting of Russian officials, tycoons and their family members. Russia's blacklist on top EU and US officials is expected to have a largely symbolic effect, given that any travel they do to Russia is usually as part of official delegations. However, a separate entry ban on nationals of \"unfriendly\" countries, including the US, the EU and Britain, is expected to have a more serious effect on tourism, business and other ties. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov indicated on Monday that a draft decree on the \"retaliatory visa measures\" was in the works.

Uranium, which is not currently produced in the US, has not appeared on the sanctions lists.Speaking to parliamentarians and reporters on Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak discussed plans to diversify Russia\u2019s oil exports. Asked to comment on the idea of stopping uranium exports to the US as a potential \u201ccounter-sanction\u201d measure, Novak replied that \u201cthis matter is also on the agenda, it is being reviewed.\u201dAlmost half of the uranium being used by US nuclear power plants has been imported from Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, despite the US having its own significant reserves.\u00a0US uranium mining sites in Texas and Wyoming, which boomed during the Cold War, have remained mothballed for a number of years. However, recent weeks saw some energy companies expressing readiness to resume production subject to agreement by nuclear power producers to commit to long-term agreements.Speaking about the impact of the sanctions, Novak said that the US and UK embargo on Russian energy resources would not mean big losses for the Russian economy.\u201cThis affected us to a lesser extent, because we supplied very little there... As for the United States, we supplied 3% of our total crude oil exports and 7% of our petroleum products,\u201d he explained.When it comes to Europe, in Novak\u2019s opinion, there is no chance that the region would ban Russian energy supplies.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely impossible at the moment\u2026 The same is true for oil, now it\u2019s impossible to replace Russian oil,\u201d the deputy prime minister said.He added that \u201cin the extreme case,\u201d Russian \u201cwould diversify deliveries towards Asian markets.\u201dMeanwhile, according to a Reuters report, EU ministers are set to discuss a ban on Russian oil as part of a fifth package of sanctions.Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

The EU gets roughly 40% of its natural gas from Russia, and more than half of the country\u2019s oil exports are destined for Europe.Reuters reports that Baltic countries including Lithuania are pushing for an oil embargo as the next logical step in putting pressure on Moscow, while Germany, the largest EU buyer of Russian crude, is urging caution because energy prices in Europe are already skyrocketing.Another EU nation, Bulgaria, has said it might seek an opt-out, according to Reuters, as the country\u2019s only oil refinery is owned by Russia\u2019s LUKOIL and provides over 60% of the nation\u2019s fuel.Meanwhile, Moscow has warned of \u2018serious\u2019 consequences an embargo of Russian oil will have on Europe. Speaking to media on Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said such a ban would \u201chave a serious and negative impact on the energy balance on the European continent.\u201d The US will not be affected as much as the EU, he added, but the people in Europe \u201cwill find it really hard.

Two days later, the House of Representatives passed a bill to ban Russian energy imports. The media, which speculated how long it would take for sanctions to turn toward energy carriers, quickly picked up the news, with some Western experts saying the US move could be followed by other countries.However, according to CNN, US Senate sources are now saying it\u2019s unlikely their chamber will move on the bill to turn it into law. The sources explain that the move by the Senate is considered unnecessary after the president took executive action to ban the imports. Also, according to Senator Joe Manchin, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, the House bill is weaker than Biden\u2019s executive action, so the Senate is reluctant to move on the measure.If the Senate does not approve the bill, the import ban won\u2019t turn into law, and US importers can continue buying Russian energy.According to official data, Russia supplied 8% of US imports of crude oil and petroleum products last year. With gasoline prices in the country hitting record highs this month, any disruption could push prices higher.At the same time, the loss of the US market would barely impact Russia\u2019s oil earnings, because the country has much bigger importers across the globe. To be effective, individual country bans would need to be mirrored by a number of states to actually affect the Russian energy export sector. Some analysts say that may be the reason Washington decided to introduce the ban in the first place \u2013 as a symbolic gesture to raise pressure on other countries and oil companies to follow suit and cease energy purchases from Russia.However, widely banning supplies from the globe\u2019s second-biggest crude producer would hurt Western countries as much as Russia. Higher oil prices would inevitably lead to higher levels of inflation and be a strain on consumer budgets.

The finish was the 75th for the prolific Lewandowski in national team colors.\u00a0Napoli man Zielinski then capitalized on sloppy defending in the 72nd minute when he engineered a one-on-one with Sweden goalkeeper Robin Olsen before calmly slotting home.Poland were indebted to stopper Wojciech Szczesny for some strong saves while Sweden boss Janne Andersson left it until the 79th minute to introduce veteran record goalscorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, by which point a pulsating game had already slipped away.Poland players were jubilant at the final whistle, celebrating on the pitch and donning T-shirts with the message that they were Qatar-bound.Tuesday night\u2019s contest took place after the Poles were handed a bye into the playoff final, avoiding a tie with Russia after they were banned by FIFA in the wake of the military operation in Ukraine.Russia and Poland had been due to meet in Moscow on March 24, with the winners facing the victors from the playoff semifinal between Sweden and the Czech Republic \u2013 which the Swedes edged 1-0 in extra-time.But each of Poland, Sweden and the Czech Republic had declared that they would refuse to play Russia before FIFA and UEFA imposed a formal ban on February 28.\u00a0The Russian Football Union has since unsuccessfully appealed a suspension of the ban with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), paving the way for the playoffs to go ahead without Russia.However, a final CAS verdict on the issue is still pending, with no hearing date being fixed.That has left Russia with a glimmer of hope that the ban can somehow be overturned, although that outcome would seem unlikely given that the playoffs have been completed and any legal victory would require them to be replayed before the World Cup kicks off in Qatar in November.Elsewhere, Ukraine\u2019s World Cup playoff semifinal against Scotland has been postponed until at least June, with the winners of that match meeting Wales for a chance to reach Qatar.In the absence of competitive fixtures during the international break, the Russian team held a training camp in Moscow.Manager Valeri Karpin recently said it would be a \u201ctriumph of common sense\u201d if the ban was reversed and his team had the chance to qualify for Qatar.The draw for the World Cup groups takes place in Qatar on Friday, with Poland entering Pot Three of the seedings.\u00a0\u00a0"},{"uuid":"34702916-3a41-4587-ba05-77ae96dacdc1","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220328\/us-prosecutors-reportedly-advance-probe-of-hunter-bidens-foreign-income-1094266641.html","title":"US Prosecutors Reportedly Advance Probe of Hunter Biden's Foreign Income","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e5\/06\/03\/1083069516_0:0:2000:3000_1440x900_80_0_1_9f782504be31a7a1e08a6494bd5bab70.jpg?source-sid=afp","subtitle":"WASHINGTON (Sputnik) \u2013 US federal tax investigators are moving forward with an investigation into the sources of Hunter Biden's foreign income, including from Ukraine, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people in the know.","content":"Prosecutors from the US attorney\u2019s office in Delaware are investigating President Joe Biden's son's relationship with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings Ltd, the money he received therefrom while serving as a board member in 2014-2019 with a monthly salary of $50,000, and how he used those funds, the report said. Investigators extensively questioned a Biden associate last month, asking about his drug and alcohol use, spending habits and state of mind in 2018, one of these sources said, suggesting prosecutors are studying whether such activity would amount to a defense against a potential criminal tax case. They have also looked into how the payments from Burisma first flowed to Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC before going on to Hunter\u2019s accounts, it added. In April 2014, one of the Biden son\u2019s business partners located in Kazakhstan wired $142,300 to Rosemont Seneca, according to bank statements, the report said. The money came from a Singapore-based company controlled by Kazakh businessman Kenges Rakishev, the report added, citing a document viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The day after receiving the money, Rosemont Seneca sent the same amount to a New Jersey car dealership to purchase a sports car for Hunter Biden, his former associate said. Prosecutors have questioned several ex-associates of Hunter Biden in order to determine whether he moved funds in a way to obscure his tax liability, the report said. They also expressed interest in his business dealings in China. The report comes after new revelations by Western media about Hunter's activity in Ukraine, citing his 2014 leaked correspondence with Pentagon defense contractor Metabiota. The e-mails, believed to have been recovered from his \"laptop from hell\", detail how Hunter Biden leveraged his influence as a board member of Burisma to funnel money into pandemic-causing pathogen research in a country neighbouring Russia.  The reports emerged shortly after the Russian Defence Ministry shed light on Hunter's links to the US-funded biolabs in eastern Ukraine. According to findings by Russia\u2019s Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Troops, one company connected to these biolabs was founded by Hunter Biden and Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former US Secretary of State John Kerry.

A swastika had been carved into her stomach.\u201cAccording to available information, Ukrainian nationalists with the Azov Battalion abused a woman from Mariupol for a long time, causing her bodily harm,\u201d Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee said in a statement on Monday.\u201cHer body, which showed signs of torture and had a swastika carved into the stomach, was found in the basement of one of the city\u2019s schools, where the nationalists\u2019 base was located,\u201d the statement reads.Over the past few weeks, the city, claimed by the breakaway Donetsk People\u2019s Republic as its territory, has become the arena of fierce urban fighting between the allied forces of Russia and Donetsk and those of Ukraine.The gruesome find was first publicized on Sunday by Patrick Lancaster, an American\u00a0who has long covered the conflict in Ukraine\u2019s east. The body of the woman was found by advancing Donetsk forces in the basement of Mariupol\u2019s School No. 25. Now used as a forward base by Ukrainian units, it is littered with left-behind uniforms, weapons, and other military equipment.The Donetsk servicemen who spoke to Lancaster allegedly said they assumed the woman was a civilian who had either tried to escape the fighting or had unwarily expressed joy over the gains made by the Russian and Donetsk forces, invoking the fury of Ukrainian nationalists.Footage from the scene suggests the woman had endured brutal torture before her death, her body being marked with multiple bruises and a torn plastic bag visible around her head. She had also had a large swastika carved into her stomach, painted with what appeared to be her own blood.The launch of an investigation into her death comes a day after Moscow announced it was seeking the source of graphic videos purporting to show Ukrainians torturing and executing captured Russian soldiers. The videos, which emerged over the weekend, apparently show militants beating and shooting their prisoners in their legs at point-blank range, with the captured soldiers dying amid their \u2018interrogation.\u2019Moscow attacked its neighbor Ukraine last month, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military alliance.

Eritrea voted against it, while 17 other African countries (out of 35 globally) abstained from the vote. These include Algeria, Angola, Burundi, Zimbabwe, Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, South Africa and South Sudan. Eight more nations did not vote: Burkina Faso, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Cameroon, Morocco, Togo, Eswatini and Ethiopia. Egypt, despite voicing its support of the resolution, is maintaining constructive cooperation with Russia anyway. No country on the African continent has so far joined the sanctions.Notably, both Senegal and Tanzania, continental economic leaders of the last decade, did not join its traditional trade and business partners to condemn Russia. Of no less significance is the statement that came from South African President Cyril Ramaphosa who said in parliament that \u201cthe war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region.\u201dSince the launch of the special operation in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has held telephone talks with three African leaders: with President of Senegal Macky Sall (who is also the Chair of the African Union until February 2023), President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa.So far, according to the official statements, the situation has not changed any plans for the Second Russia\u2013Africa Summit - set to be held later this year. On March 3, Presidential Special Envoy for Africa and Middle East Mikhail Bogdanov told the Russian News Agency TASS that \u201cpreparations are underway\u201d and \u201cthe dates for the summit are yet to be announced.\u201dIn the meantime, the military conflict, sanctions and economic measures introduced by the Russian government to stabilize the domestic market will no doubt have a significant effect on the African economies.Between 2015 and 2020, Russia and Ukraine supplied up to 25% of the total wheat imports into Africa.A series of consequences have hit the sector, including a potential temporary ban on wheat exports, disruption to the sowing season in Ukraine, delays with shipments via the Black Sea routes and a looming fertilizer crisis that might affect other key suppliers of wheat to Africa, such as France and Brazil. These issues pose a serious food security threat to a number of African nations, including Egypt, Algeria, Sudan and Tanzania.At the same time, supply disruptions will affect African countries in different ways. For example, in Nigeria this problem can be solved relatively painlessly: wheat is a commodity with a flexible demand in the country, occupying a market share that\u2019s comparable with other crops, such as corn and cassava.In other areas, however, the situation not only threatens demand, but also challenges a number of business projects, such as large-scale investments in wheat and other crop storage infrastructure network, as some of these investment projects involve Russian businesses and funding.Another persistent problem is caused by the shortage of logistics corridors due to sanctions and restrictions. Currently, Russia is unable to run massive grain and fertilizer supplies via the Caspian Sea and Iran.A sector where Africa is also bound to feel the change is the energy market. On the one hand, Europe shunning Russian oil and gas leaves African nations such as Algeria, Libya, and Nigeria with an opportunity to step in and fill in the gap in the hydrocarbons exports. On the other hand, this opportunity, so far, seems to be strictly hypothetical since none of these nations have the capacity to take advantage of the opportunity within the next five years.Nigeria, for instance, lacks the capacity for free exports, while other nations, such as Algeria, Libya and to a lesser extent Egypt, might not have too much surplus natural gas and crude oil to sell. Another problem in this area that will have to be dealt with is the rising oil prices triggering the growth of oil product prices. Oil products are mostly imported by African nations, and this crisis is going to hit the nations that rely on imported diesel and residual fuel oil the hardest, such as West Africa.If the euro zone is engulfed by a crisis, a massive outflow of capital and a persistent economic confrontation with Russia might mean to Africa less economic and tech support from the EU and its member states.The future of infrastructure investment projects announced at the EU\u2013African Union Summit in February as part of the ambitious Global Gateway Investment Package is also questionable. In the medium term, the social and economic situation in West Africa is causing the biggest concern. This region has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic harder than others, and a new crisis hitting its food and energy security might further destabilize the regional political systems.The global crisis, once again, confirms Africa's critical dependence on events not directly related to it. The risk of such destabilization can be countered by investing in the localization of the production of the main commodity categories that are critical for the continental economy: fertilizers, oil products, and food.In the developing stand-off between the West and the East, Africa will try to remain \u2018above the battle,\u2019 metaphorically speaking. It most probably won\u2019t have to step up its budget spending on defense. To achieve that, it just needs to make sure the US-Russia-China confrontation steers clear of the African Continent and to try to maintain its neutral status, remaining united in the process \u2013 which is currently an issue, as the recent UN vote has shown."},{"uuid":"34f3b67a-12cc-4c4b-888b-7e6264154b4b","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220321\/how-might-hunter-bidens-laptop-from-hell-story-backfire-on-us-president-1094058638.html","title":"How Might Hunter Biden's 'Laptop from Hell' Story Backfire on US President?","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e5\/05\/15\/1082955494_0:0:3072:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_ae918fcf369c442bf850fa920b41c183.jpg?source-sid=ap_photo","subtitle":"The Hunter Biden \"laptop story\" remained buried by major US mainstream media for 17 months until The New York Times suddenly admitted that damning emails, allegedly implicating both Hunter and his father, incumbent President Joe Biden, appear to be authentic. How will the NYT report pan out for Joe Biden and the Democratic administration?","content":"\"This story underscores that the American MSM, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter were deliberately collaborating with the American deep state and the Democratic Party to secure the 2020 Presidential Election for Joe Biden\", says former US Senate candidate and investigative journalist Mark Dankof. This \"'fix-is-in\" suppression of the story, originally discovered by the New York Post in October 2020, is nothing new, notes the journalist. The same \"fix-is-in\" approach was also adopted by the previous US administrations of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama and included the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999; the 2003 invasion of Iraq under a completely false pretext; the \"criminal use of NATO\" in Libya and \"the accompanying extra-judicial assassination\" of Muammar Gaddafi; the support of Islamists in Syria to oust President Bashar al-Assad; the US-backed coup d'etat in February 2014 in Kiev; and then-Vice President Joe Biden's role in firing the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma, according to Dankof. The former Senate candidate notes that much in the same vein, the US mainstream media and American politicians remain tight-lipped about Russia\u2019s legitimate national security concerns which are driving the nation's special operation in Ukraine. Similarly, the existence of American biolabs in Ukraine had been ridiculed as a \"conspiracy theory\" by the US MSM - until Victoria Nuland at least partially confirmed their existence - while Volodymyr Zelensky's threats to nix Ukraine's non-nuclear status were completely overlooked, according to Dankof. Even though most of the US mainstream media has ignored the NYT's latest piece addressing the ongoing federal investigation into Hunter Biden and his laptop, it may add to Joe Biden's already poor approval ratings, according to Dankof. Although some pollsters note that Joe Biden's rating improved after his State of Union address, in which he castigated Russia over the Ukraine special operation, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker indicates that in the last two weeks or so, the president's approval rating has only ticked up from 41.1 percent to 42.9 percent. Given Biden's plummeting ratings and the Democratic Party's inability to push through its initiatives, the GOP is expected to make major gains in the 2022 midterms, according to observers. If the Republican Party \"doesn\u2019t regain control of Capitol Hill with the catastrophic performance of Biden in the aftermath of a rigged Presidential Election in 2020, it ought to hang it up\", Dankof says. Hunter Biden's laptop story originates in the New York Post's October 2020 bombshell article that exposed alleged corruption by the former vice president's son and apparent involvement of Joe Biden in Hunter's business deals. For his part, Joe Biden vehemently denied that he had the slightest knowledge about his son's work and financial gains. The laptop in question, containing a trove of potentially damning documents, was reportedly abandoned by Hunter Biden at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. However, the laptop story was ditched by Big Media and Big Tech amid the 2020 presidential cycle. GOP lawmakers subjected Silicon Valley giants to criticism over suppressing the Hunter laptop story following the NYT's admission that emails extracted from the laptop had been \"verified.\" Republican Representative Claudia Tenney told the New York Post on 19 March that Congress must \"rein in Big Tech censors\". For his part, Republican Senator Ted Cruz highlighted that \"Big Tech leaders who participated in censoring the truth should answer to Congress and the American people in sworn testimony\". Meanwhile, some lawyers familiar with the Hunter Biden case do not rule out that the president's son could be indicted. \u201cI expect him to be indicted\u201d, said attorney Clint Lancaster, as quoted by National Review. \u201cJust based on what I saw in his financial records, I would be surprised if he\u2019s not indicted\u201d. E. Michael Jones holds a different stance: he believes that the Hunter Biden scandal will remain swept under the rug and that the Bidens will be allowed to get away with this. \"The Clinton family has never been held accountable for their crimes. Justice, as Thrasymachus said in Plato's Republic, is the opinion of the powerful\", Jones stresses.

As supplies of sunflower oil have been disrupted from the most prominent producer, Ukraine, Indian dealers are mulling options to ease the shortage of edible oils in the country.","content":"India has started replacing Ukrainian sunflower oil with Russia, as dealers have contracted at least 45,000 tonnes for April delivery. India's edible oil players, such as Gemini Edibles &amp; Fats India, have received letters of credit from Indian banks.  This is the first order since Moscow began its special military operation in Ukraine to \"demilitarise\" and \"de-Nazify\" the Eastern European country. The delivery will ease the supply constraint in the domestic market, which has recently seen a sharp surge in edible oil prices. The executive director of the premier vegetable oil industry association said that the shortfall would be met by increasing imports from Russia. \"We expect more supply as two ports of Russia are still operating. Government is very keen to resolve the payment mechanism, and we hope it will be sorted out soon whether it would be in rupee or rupee-ruble mechanism; let's wait\", Mehta added. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is expected to arrive in New Delhi in the first week of April to discuss a range of bilateral issues, including finalising a payment system to continue trade. In February, about 152,000 tonnes of sunflower oil arrived in India. A similar quantity is likely to come in March, as vessels that left before the military operation will arrive at Indian ports this month. However, Mehta of the Solvent Extractors' Association of India said that the current landing cost of sunflower oil is around $2,100 per ton compared to approximately $1,600 per ton a month ago. \"At this landing cost, sunflower oil will be available for Indian consumers at INR 200-250 per litre.

Hayward\u2019s skepticism has already led Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi to promise a \u201ccrackdown\u201d on such wrongthink.Hayward shared an article on Sunday from the Grayzone, a left-wing news outlet. Citing eyewitnesses in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the article claims that Ukrainian \u2018Azov\u2019 fighters \u2013 once described by western outlets and lawmakers as \u201cneo-Nazis\u201d \u2013 sheltered behind civilians in a theater in Mariupol, before blowing the building up as Russian forces entered the Ukrainian city.Azov forces and journalists linked to the extremist unit accused Russia of bombing the building, and used the incident to call for western intervention against Russia. US President Joe Biden declared Russian President Vladimir Putin a \u201cwar criminal\u201d in response, and American politicians from both parties and from Europe renewed their calls for military aid \u2013 including fighter jets \u2013 for Ukraine.However, no video exists showing the theater being bombed and Russia denies attacking the building, stating that it had \u201cnever been considered as a strike target.\u201d Conflicting reports of the weapons supposedly used and the civilian casualties or lack thereof only muddy the picture further.Yet Hayward was condemned by his colleagues for raising the issue. In a Times article on Tuesday accusing him of \u201cspreading propaganda,\u201d Dr. Aliaksandr Herasimenka, a \u2018misinformation\u2019 researcher at Oxford University, said that \u201cwe must be very careful\u201d when reading reports critical of the official narrative in Ukraine, and that outlets like the Grayzone \u201care currently engaged in a massive disinformation campaign.\u201d He did not provide any evidence that would support such allegations against the media outlet.Hayward has been singled out by the Scottish government too. Having shared articles questioning the alleged bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol and claiming that Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad did not gas his own citizens as Western sources insist, the professor was accused in Westminster last week by Tory MP Robert Halfon as being a \u201cuseful idiot for President Putin\u2019s atrocities.\u201dEducation Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said that academics like Hayward were already being investigated, and that their universities would be contacted.\u201cPutin and his cronies are a malign influence on anyone in this country buying their false narrative, and I have to repeat it is a false and dangerous narrative, and we will crack down on it hard,\u201d Zahawi said, without elaborating on how.Speaking to Edinburgh Live, Hayward said that he is concerned about restrictions to free speech, and considers hearing both points of view important in wartime.\"In war, miscalculations can have terrible consequences. We also know that misinformation can sometimes even slip through on our own side, as when the UK went to war in Iraq, mistakenly believing it had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d he said. \"As for the people of Ukraine, their need is for peace \u2013 not to become the epicenter of World War III,\u201d he added, referring to the widely-held belief that were Western powers to intervene in Ukraine, the consequence would be a third world war."},{"uuid":"36fd5681-f4b8-449e-bc1f-156bbf242c71","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220329\/youtube-continues-its-assualt-on-the-press-removes-6-years-of-chris-hedges-rt-show-from-platform-1094302155.html","title":"YouTube Continues its Assault on the Press, Removes 6 Years of Chris Hedges' RT Show From Platform","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e6\/03\/0b\/1093787782_0:0:3072:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_6a57e5a78603cfc1e736181bc5fcbc2d.jpg?source-sid=afp","subtitle":"On Monday, YouTube removed six years' worth of episodes of the Emmy-nominated show On Contact by Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges.

From social commentators like Noam Chomsky and Cornel West, novelist Russell Banks, journalists Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi and human rights lawyer Steven Donziger, among many others, the show provided a platform for many different voices. RT America (formerly Russia Today America) is funded by the Russian government, not unlike Sputnik News. RT was dropped from American cable networks and YouTube after Russia\u2019s special operation in Ukraine. The EU and the UK also banned RT and in the case of the EU, Sputnik News. The justification for Russian media\u2019s disappearance in the West was over allegations of \u201cRussian disinformation\u201d being spread, particularly as it pertains to the situation in Ukraine. With the removal of On Contact, the justification has seemingly been expanded to include not just Ukraine but any information with even a tenuous connection to Russia. On Contact did not discuss the situation in Ukraine, its primary focus was on the multitude of issues facing the West. Hedges, the former New York Times journalist and creator of On Contact, explains. Hedges\u2019 channel is not the only one to be censored as US tech giants look to appease their government\u2019s foreign policy objectives. As he mentions, Progressive Soapbox was recently demonetized and Status Coup was suspended for airing footage of the January 6 riots, something nearly every mainstream outlet also aired. As OpIndia points out, the Indian news channel WION was suspended for airing parts of a speech by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. WION claims Western outlets also covered the speech but were not de-platformed. YouTube, as a private entity, can choose what it allows on its platform. However, YouTube\u2019s dominance of its marketplace essentially makes it the video platform of record on the internet. If a video is not on YouTube, it might as well not exist. Its biggest direct competitors are Dailymotion and Vimeo, which have a fraction of YouTube\u2019s audience. Congress has recently begun pressuring social media platforms to combat \u2018disinformation.\u2019 With the massive scope of large tech companies, corporate censorship is almost as impactful as government censorship.

The city, regarded as a hotbed of Ukrainian nationalism, is about 500km (300 miles) west of the capital, Kiev, and just 50km (30 miles) from the Polish border. \u00a0\u00a0The information on the supposed\u00a0plot was provided by an officer from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), whom Moscow says voluntarily surrendered to Russian forces.\u00a0\u201cThe officer was directly involved in the organizing and training of sabotage and terrorist groups to work in areas liberated from the nationalists,\u201d Konashenkov stated, adding that the individual had given the Russian military a list of SBU agents involved in such activities.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to stress that the Kiev regime is fully aware of the plans harbored by the nationalists, but is doing nothing to prevent them,\u201d he added.The ultimate goal of the alleged attacks is to blame Moscow for them, using the incidents as leverage to push the NATO countries into providing more weaponry and establishing a long-demanded no-fly zone over the country, Konashenkov claimed.Moscow launched a large-scale offensive against its neighboring country last month, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine's failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to regularize the status of the breakaway regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the NATO military bloc.

The diplomat said most countries outside the collective West don't want to \"engage in a one-sided game\" amid the current crisis, notwithstanding \"enormous pressure\" and \"propaganda juggling the numbers of votes cast for provocative UN resolutions\". Lavrov expressed confidence that most countries in the world will not join the West's sanctions games. \"The vast majority of countries in the world are interested in developing equitable cooperation based on the key principles laid down in the UN Charter, first and foremost - the principle of the sovereign equality of states,\" he said. The Russian diplomat also suggested that efforts by the West to \"rudely trample\" over these principles to try to \"impose its superiority\" are \"doomed to failure\", as even the history of Europe has shown. Commenting on the crisis in Ukraine and Western powers' reaction to the situation, Lavrov recalled US and European media's \"hushing\" up of the killings of civilians and the economic blockade of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics by Ukrainian forces for nearly eight years. He also pointed to US and European work to pump Ukraine up with weaponry, and efforts to encourage Kiev to \"resolve\" the Donbass crisis by force. The current situation in the world has been \"heated up to the limit,\" according to Lavrov. \"In fact, we are witnessing the culmination of the policy of containment of Russia, which the West has pursued for a long time.\" The \"apogee of this Russophobic line was Washington and Brussels' support for the regime in Kiev,\" he said. \"It's worth remembering the laws that have been consistently adopted in Ukraine [after the 2014 Maidan coup] regarding the Russian language, or rather, regarding the ban on the use of the Russian language in education, in the media, and in everyday life, and thereby, in effect, uprooting from Ukraine all of its Russian roots and crossing out the common history of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples,\" Lavrov said. \"The desire by the West to maintain its dominance in international affairs, to subjugate everything and everyone and return to a unipolar world - these are, of course, illusions,\" Lavrov said. Efforts by the West to maintain its hegemony \"by hook or by crook, but rather by crook,\" are the cause of \"serious tension in international relations,\" according to Lavrov, and can only be counteracted \"together with our partners and allies.\" The foreign minister stressed that despite the best efforts of Western powers, there can be no talk of Russia's isolation on the world stage. \"We are not going to isolate ourselves.

Then, Jim Kavanagh, the editor of thepolemicist.net joins the conversation to talk about the Justice Department admitting to a federal judge that it had lost one of the January 6 defendants in jail. He somehow got lost in the system and because he was denied his day in court the feds must drop the charges against him. The prosecutor argued that they should be allowed to refile the charges. Attorneys ended up getting the defendant to plead guilty to assaulting a police officer as quickly as possible before the government could add different charges. And, they talk about the NYT report that Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop does in fact exist. For the last segment, Ford Fischer a primary source documentarian work in Oscar, Emmy, Golden Globe winning films and Editor-in-chief, News2Share joins the show to talk about Michael Dunn who is a member of the Boogaloo movement. Dunn has recently joined the militia in Ukraine to fight the Russians. Fischer explains why Dunn believes he should join the battle and what difference he thinks he can make.

On her Instagram Stories on Friday, she posted a photo where someone is standing on the Russian national flag.This came to the attention of Russian swimmers such as\u00a0six-time Youth Olympics gold medalist Kliment Kolesnikov, European Aquatics Championships gold medalist Vladislav Grinev and recent Beijing 2020 athlete Maxim Stupin, who was a teammate of Gunes' at Energy Standard before Russian athletes were banned from international competitions as a response to Russia's military operation in Ukraine.\u00a0Kolesnikov, who was also on Energy Standard, shared the Stories post and added two question marks either side of an emoji of a man throwing his hands up in confusion.But Stupin and Grinev were far more vocal, and left the same message which asked: \"Where are the boundaries of the permitted behavior of athletes?\"A post shared by Viktoria Zeynep Gunes (@viktoriagunes)\"If you decide that it is humane to remove Russian athletes from participation in international competitions, then take action here as well. Nationalism is UNACCEPTABLE in any form,\" they said, while, like Kolesnikov, tagging a number of bodies such as\u00a0FINA, the European Swimming Federation (LEN), the International Swimming League (ISL) plus Team Energy.FINA has been busy this week\u00a0regarding Russian swimmers after finally announcing a ban on their participation in international events\u00a0much later than other sporting federations.The body also opened an investigation into Tokyo 2020 double gold medalist\u00a0Evgeny Rylov, who is\u00a0suspected of potentially violating their rules due to\u00a0\"alleged participation\"\u00a0in a Moscow concert that celebrated the reunification of Crimea with Russia and was held under a\u00a0'For a World Without Nazism'\u00a0banner.\"The FINA Executive has requested that the panel\u2019s proceedings be expedited,\"\u00a0the governing body added in a statement that announced the blanket ban, though the\u00a0Russian Swimming Federation claim that their correspondence from FINA was incorrectly worded and that \"the possibility of participating in other events\u00a0is theoretically preserved\".\"FINA will now consider each specific case for the participation of Russians,\"\u00a0Vladimir Salnikov explained to Match TV about participation in events beyond the\u00a0World Aquatics Championships in Budapest this summer.But Rylov, who has also lost his Speedo sponsorship, had already ruled himself out of the competition before FINA's announcement in protest against Russian athletes being barred from the Paralympic Games in Beijing earlier in March.\"I believe that by losing competition, the development of sports is lost. No matter how sad it may sound, the sport cannot move without worthy competitors,\"\u00a0the 25-year-old Rylov announced on social media when\u00a0revealing his boycott.\u00a0"},{"uuid":"3848f824-2c5a-4bbd-b687-9fb66673619c","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220322\/us-navy-deploys-carrier-strike-group-in-med-to-implement-ukraine-no-fly-zone-if-biden-gives-order-1094082091.html","title":"US Navy Deploys Carrier Strike Group in Med to Implement Ukraine No-Fly Zone If Biden Gives Order","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/103247\/56\/1032475649_0:0:3500:1954_1440x900_80_0_1_8b583141a83a05196bbad278a69ff60c.jpg?source-sid=ap_photo","subtitle":"The United States operates 11 carrier strike groups, and has deployed them repeatedly across the globe over the decades in a show of force against mostly smaller, militarily weaker nations.

The only thing that Putin understands is strength\u201d, Del Toro said, speaking to Politico. The Nimitz-class carrier and its escorts are currently stationed in the Ionian Sea, the body of water directly southeast of the Italian \"boot\" and the western coast of Greece. Its aircraft are said to have carried out over 75 patrol missions along NATO\u2019s eastern flank, including near the Ukrainian border, over the past month. The Truman has been used repeatedly in US wars of aggression, with its aircraft flying over 1,200 combat sorties during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and assisting coalition forces during fighting against the Taliban* insurgency in Afghanistan in the 2010s. The current tensions between Russia and NATO over Ukraine aren\u2019t the first time the US has deployed a carrier strike group in the Med as a show of force against Moscow. In the spring of 2014, in the wake of the victory of the US and EU-backed Maidan coup in Kiev and tensions between Russia and NATO over the fate of Crimea, Washington deployed another Nimitz-class carrier, the George H.W. Bush, near the peninsula off southern Turkey. A growing number of US lawmakers has called for the introduction of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, notwithstanding the danger of provoking a direct military confrontation with Russia. The US and its allies have experience implementing no-fly zones over mostly small and militarily overmatched countries, including Iraq, Bosnia, and Libya. Between 1991 and 2011, NATO used no-fly zones against these countries not only to stop the operation of aircraft over designated areas, but to themselves engage in the bombing of ground targets. In Iraq, authorities estimate that up to 1,400 civilians were killed in US and UK-enforced no-fly zones between 1991 and 2003. In Bosnia between 1993 and 1995, NATO jets bombed civilian infrastructure and killed over 150 civilians, and polluted the country with cancer-causing depleted uranium shells. The no-fly zone instituted over Libya in 2011 played a crucial role in overthrowing the Gaddafi government and turning the country into a failed state with open-air slave markets. * The Taliban are a group under United Nations sanctions for terrorist activities.

In that case Russia would have had to stand up for tens and tens of thousands of our Russian citizens living there anyway.Under these circumstances, Russia was forced to launch a pre-emptive special military operation.Yesterday, for the first time in all these years, the Kiev authorities declared that they are ready to negotiate with Russia and conveyed the provisions of a possible future agreement, which states the following:\u2022 the refusal to join NATO, fixation of Ukraine's bloc-free status;\u2022 the renunciation of nuclear weapons;\u2022 an obligation to conduct troop exercises only with the consent of the guarantor states, which must include Russia.That is, Ukraine stated that it\u2019s ready to fulfill these demands that Russia has been insisting on all these years.If all these obligations are fulfilled, the threat of creating a NATO bridgehead on Ukrainian territory will be eliminated.That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to agree upon this treaty at the highest level.However, the negotiations and our work continue.I\u2019d like to stress that Russia\u2019s position regarding Crimea and Donbass remains the same.\u201d"},{"uuid":"3bf72d25-ae1e-42fa-8b39-6d46a48b95c8","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220325\/wto-director-general-warns-rising-food-prices-may-prompt-unrest-in-poor-countries-1094173808.html","title":"WTO Director General Warns Rising Food Prices May Prompt Unrest in Poor Countries","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e5\/04\/17\/1082708865_0:0:1280:850_1440x900_80_0_1_be65079f94d93b093e17636ee477e45e.jpg?source-sid=cc_by-sa_20","subtitle":"LONDON (Sputnik) - World Trade Organization (WTO) Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said that the hike in food prices that is happening as a result of the situation in Ukraine may prompt unrest among undernourished people in poverty-stricken countries.","content":"\"I think we should be very worried.

Okonjo-Iweala also said that Russian and Ukrainian wheat supplies account for 24% of the global market, and that Ukraine provides about 50% of wheat to the World Food Programme, warning of a new possible catastrophe. \"If we don't think about how to mitigate the impact of the war that will be another catastrophe not just this year but next year,\" she said, adding that \"we are talking to our members and urging them not to compound this crisis by having export restrictions on food.\" Ukraine and Russia remain the world's leading suppliers of wheat as well as sunflower, rapeseed, linseed and soybeans used for oil and animal feed. Half of the world's sunflower oil comes from Ukraine and another 21% from Russia. In Italy, prices of bread, pasta and meat have already risen as the country imports most of its wheat from Eastern Europe and 80% of its sunflower oil from Ukraine. Earlier this week, President of the German Farmers' Association Joachim Rukwied said that the cost of wheat and other foods in Germany has increased significantly since the beginning of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine and is expected to keep increasing. At the same time, the Carrefour supermarket chain, which is widely represented in France, Spain and Italy, said it was not experiencing any scarcity. Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council Jan Egeland warned that Somalia, importing 90% of its wheat from Ukraine and Russia, may face acute food insecurity. Last week, the WTO told Sputnik that it had received a statement of intention to take action against Russia over its military operation in Ukraine, including depriving it of the \"most favored nation\" treatment, from 14 member states. The WTO was created with the goal of liberalizing international trade and regulating trade and political relations among member states. The organization currently unites 164 countries, Russia officially joined on August 22, 2012 after 18 years of negotiations.

The clip offers insights into the Home Office\u2019s response to the crisis between the West and Russia, from lobbying within Interpol aimed at kicking Russia out of the international policing body, to the seizure of Russian tycoon-owned assets and even \"special screening\" for Russian nationals seeking to enter the UK. A video of the call was originally posted on the pranksters' official YouTube channel, which was blocked by the platform on Saturday. Interpol Commenting on her government\u2019s efforts to eject Russia from Interpol, Patel complained that the body\u2019s reaction so far has been \u201cabsolutely feeble\u201d and \u201cvery weak.\u201d \u201cThey should\u2019ve just gone for a blanket suspensions because of the barbarians that Russia are basically, and the way in which they abuse Interpol systems,\u201d Patel said.

The Home Secretary have her assurance that support for Britain\u2019s stance wasn\u2019t limited to western nations, and that Kenya has been \u201ca big ally and a big supporter and a big voice\u201d. Keeping Allies in Line Patel promised that the UK would do its part to keep allies in line generally, and make sure that they are \u201cmore robust\u201d in their support for Kiev. \u201cAnd I think, Prime Minister, if I may say so, not just on Interpol but on other issues, you see some of our allies working at a different level compared with the United Kingdom. You\u2019ll find that we are out there in a very, very strong and forceful way, and that there are others trying to catch up,\u201d she said. Refugees Thanked by the \u2018Ukrainian Prime Minister\u2019 for the Home Office\u2019s simplification of UK visa procedures for Ukrainians, Patel reported that, as of 15 March, more than 4,000 visas had been issued to date \u201cfor Ukrainian nationals to come to the United Kingdom to be reunited with their family\u201d. Patel promised to simplify the process further, and gave her personal \u201creassurance to making this scheme work\u201d. Trolled by her interviewer, who said he was happy that the UK wasn\u2019t worried about Ukrainian nationalists, Banderites and neo-Nazis coming to the country under the guise of refugees, Patel assured him that Britons are not afraid. \u201cClearly they\u2019re not. For us the support is very significant here. It really is,\u201d she said. Russian Property, Russian Rights Patel also briefed her interlocutor on the government\u2019s new powers to deprive Russian tycoons affiliated with the Russian government of property in the UK. These powers, she said, \u201cwill enable us as a government to do two things \u2026 first of all, to clamp down on illicit Russian funds in London, but also in terms of the ability to go after their wealth, and their wealth could be their Ferraris, it could be their properties, it could be a range of assets, through new laws that we have brought in.\u201d Patel also revealed that she is in the midst of drafting legislation that would limit the influence of \u201cRussian agents\u201d in the UK. Asked whether perhaps all Russians in the UK should have their rights restricted for supporting the Russian government, including through checks \u201cin a special way\u201d on entering the country, Patel pledged that there was \u201cwork taking place\u201d. Assange Encouraged by the pranksters to keep working with organisations such as Bellingcat while holding investigative journalist Julian Assange locked up in prison, Patel assured her interlocutor that \u201cour approach is very, very clear in terms of the organisations we work with\u201d. \u201cAnd of course, in certain cases, such as the Assange case, we have a judicial process that has to work within the United Kingdom. And when it comes to some of our laws such as extradition, of course that\u2019s in the hands of the courts,\u201d she added. \u2018Englishwoman Plays It Dirty\u2019 At the end of the interview, Patel was asked to repeat the well-known \u201cSlava Ukraini\u201d (\u2018Glory to Ukraine\u2019) expression used by Ukrainian nationalists going back to the Second World War. She was also trolled into saying \u201cAnglichanka Gadit!\u201d, a Russian colloquialism meaning \u201cAn Englishwoman makes mischief\u201d or \u201cThe Englishwoman plays it dirty,\u201d a reference to the 19th-century foreign policy of Queen Victoria against Russia. Patel confirmed in a tweet last week that she had been duped into giving an interview to the Russian pranksters after Defence Secretary Ben Wallace tweeted that he had also been spoken to by a Russian \u201cimposter claiming to be the Ukrainian PM\u201d. The Wallace video call, held while the Defence Secretary was travelling in Poland, provided important details about the UK\u2019s strategy in the Russia-West crisis over Ukraine, including plans to sail the country\u2019s Navy into the Black Sea, the state of weapons deliveries, and even veiled support for a Ukrainian nuclear weapons programme.

US and European officials have expressed consternation about how India, Pakistan and other non-western countries have responded to the Ukraine calamity, including over the way regional rivals New Delhi and Islamabad, who rarely agree on anything, jointly abstained from condemning Russia at the UN General Assembly.

Red Star Belgrade defeated Rangers 2-1, but this was not enough to progress to the quarterfinals of the Europa League as the club lost 3-0 during the first leg.The performance comes amid unprecedented tensions between Russia and the West over the situation in Ukraine. Washington and its allies accused Moscow of \"invading\" Ukraine. The Kremlin, for its part, rejected the accusations and said that the special operation Moscow is conducting is meant to de-Nazify Kiev and protect the residents of the two breakaway regions from the genocide waged by Ukraine's leadership. Moscow also accused the West of turning a blind eye to war crimes committed by Kiev in Donbass. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

That\u2019s why we agreed to the talks, which are resuming in Istanbul,\u201d Lavrov said during a video conference on Monday with the Serbian media. The discussions are scheduled to continue on Tuesday.The Turkish government, which has good ties with both Russia and Ukraine, has put\u00a0a great deal of effort into getting the two sides around the negotiating table, Lavrov explained. However, there's no need to include the EU or the US \u2013 which support Kiev in the conflict \u2013 in the peace process, according to the minister.\u201cThere are many examples of times when the achievements of diplomacy were shattered by Western colleagues. They can\u2019t be trusted anymore,\u201d Lavrov opined.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to see any shuttle diplomacy from our Western partners, because they\u2019ve already done their \u2018shuttling\u2019 \u2013 in February 2014 in Ukraine and in February 2015 in Minsk,\u201d he added.In February 2014, the EU became the guarantor of the agreements between Ukraine\u2019s then-president Viktor Yanukovych and the Maidan protesters in Kiev, Lavrov reminded viewers. \u201cIt was a pinnacle of diplomacy. But, the next morning, the opposition spat on that diplomacy, and the EU had to swallow it.\u201dYanukovich ended up being deposed after violent clashes and fleeing the country, and the new Ukrainian authorities soon sent their military to the eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk, where most of the population had refused to recognize the coup in the capital.In September of the same year, the Minsk I agreement between the breakaway republics and Kiev was reached\u00a0in the Belarusian capital, having been negotiated by Ukraine, Russia, Germany, and France in the so-called Normandy Format. The deal called on the two sides to stop fighting, organize prisoner exchanges, allow deliveries of humanitarian aid, and withdraw heavy weaponry.\u201cThe diplomacy then reached new heights in February 2015, when the agreements that were signed in Minsk ended the war in eastern Ukraine and opened the way to restoring Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity by granting a special status to the Donbass,\u201d the minister continued.The second agreement, Minsk II, introduced another ceasefire and paved the way for administrative and political reform in Ukraine as well as for autonomy and local elections in the Donbass republics. However, Kiev\u2019s Western backers were subsequently unable to persuade the Ukrainian government to fulfil its promises.\u201cThe European Union has proven its incompetence as an organization that is capable of fulfilling the agreements being reached,\u201d Lavrov said.Russia sent its troops into Ukraine over a month ago, following Kiev\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.Moscow has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."},{"uuid":"3d57fd3d-dec2-4576-8b10-8ea9478df905","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220324\/sweden-to-send-more-arms-to-ukraine-amid-russias-special-op-1094137666.html","title":"Sweden to Send More Arms to Ukraine Amid Russia's Special Op","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/105702\/89\/1057028940_0:0:1280:698_1440x900_80_0_1_adb623b1cb616e98cafd565915ffa057.jpg?source-sid=cc_by-sa_30","subtitle":"While the new arms donations to Ukraine have been supported by all Swedish parties with no exception, this unanimity is at clearly at odds with popular opinion, as only 39 percent of Swedes thought that Stockholm should assist Ukraine with weapons in a poll conducted at the end of February.","content":"Sweden will support the Ukrainian military with 5,000 anti-tank rocket launchers, as well as minesweeping equipment, costing taxpayers something to the tune of SEK 205 million ($22 million), in accordance with a decision made by the nation's parliament. Pansarskott 86 (international designation AT-4) are short-range anti-tank weapons designed and manufactured in Sweden by Saab Bofors Dynamics. A single weapon weighs 6.7 kg and measures 102 centimetres in length and can be used once before it is discarded. It can hit targets at a maximum distance of 400 meters. While its explosive power is not fully sufficient to knock out modern tanks, it can nevertheless destroy or deactivate armoured vehicles and fortifications. The arms assistance is meant to help Ukraine against Russia's special operation aimed to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" the country, which Sweden, in line with the rest of the West, has condemned as \u201cinvasion\u201d. Hultqvist opened up for even more deliveries in the future. This will be the second time Sweden has contributed military equipment to a country in conflict, defying its stated principles. In the previous delivery earlier in March, Sweden contributed, among other things, anti-tank weapons, helmets, safety vests and field rations. Subsequently, Supreme Commander Chief Micael Byd\u00e9n confirmed that the equipment had arrived in Ukraine. When it was decided at the end of February about the first delivery of 5,000 anti-tank rocket launchers to Ukraine, all parliamentary parties voted in favour, except the Left Party, which referred to the fact that Sweden doesn't send weapons to war zones. For doing so, the Left was castigated by fellow MPs and the press, to the point of being accused of treason. This time, the Left voted in favour of sending additional arms to the Ukraine, meaning that all of Sweden parties are now in favour of arms assistance to nation in conflict. However, this unanimity clearly contradicts with popular opinion. At the end of February, only 39 percent of Swedes thought that Stockholm should assist Ukraine with weapons. Earlier, Sweden voiced plans to boost its own defence budget to levels unseen in decades, prompting comparisons to massive Cold War-era defence hikes in the 1950s. Additionally, the perennial NATO debate has flared up anew using the Russian operation as a pretext. The special operation was launched by Moscow after Ukrainian attacks in Donbass prompted mass evacuations of civilians, forcing the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk to appeal to Russia for aid. Ever since, Moscow has stressed emphatically that it harbours no occupation plans. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

On Monday, Biden insisted he was \u201ctalking about helping train \u2026 the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland,\u201d again landing himself in hot water as White House officials raced to clarify that US forces are not, in fact, training foreign troops on Polish soil.\u00a0During a press briefing later on Monday, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield told reporters \u201cthere is regular interaction between Ukrainian soldiers in Poland and the US troops that the president saw on the trip,\u201d insisting that Biden did not accidentally reveal \u201ccompromised information.\u201d\u201cThe troops that he met with in Poland routinely interact with Ukrainians. That is something that\u2019s known,\u201d she continued, though also declined to get into specifics about what interactions the troops have had.Asked about US forces currently stationed in Europe, Wolters said American troop levels have swelled from 60,000 to 100,000 since Russia began its military operation in Ukraine in late February. Nearly half of those soldiers are deployed to Germany, and of those, the general noted that 70% would have a direct combat role should they be activated, calling them the \u201cteeth\u201d of the US presence. Some of the troops may be stationed on the continent permanently, Wolters added, stating that European defense contributions in the coming months would determine EUCOM\u2019s next steps.While Washington and other NATO states have worked to bolster Kiev\u2019s defenses with arms shipments, the allies have repeatedly stated they will not get directly involved in the war in Ukraine, instead committing to defend the territory of member states only. Though prior US administrations have declared that Ukraine would someday be admitted into the bloc, it remains outside of NATO, and the Biden administration has warned that American intervention could kick off an armed confrontation with Moscow, or even World War III."},{"uuid":"3f014053-ab61-4ca3-97ef-0e9e3651b81d","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552220-china-us-military-aid-ukraine\/","title":"China takes a stand on US military aid to Ukraine","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623463d72030272b343fdc64.jpg","subtitle":"Humanitarian assistance is a better way to curb the refugee crisis, Beijing insists","content":"The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke out against US military assistance for Ukraine on Friday, claiming it prevented the restoration of peace and stability in the region.

On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the move \"theft.\"","content":"The collective West's decision to freeze Russian reserves abroad constitutes the bankruptcy of their obligations before Russia, and undermines faith in their currencies, President Vladimir Putin has said. \"In this connection, it's clear that supplying our goods to the European Union and the United States and receiving payment in dollars, euros and a number of other currencies does not make any sense to us,\" Putin added. Putin ordered the Russian Central Bank and the government to work out the means for payments to be made in rubles for Russian natural gas exports by countries designated as 'unfriendly' by Moscow, and instructed Gazprom to amend existing contracts accordingly.  \"Unlike some of our colleagues, we value our business reputation as a reliable partner and supplier. The changes will only affect the payment currency, which will be changed to Russian rubles,\" Putin stressed. \"Russia will unquestionably continue to export natural gas in accordance with volumes at prices fixed in contracts concluded earlier,\" he added.  Russia exports an estimated $10 billion in gas monthly. The European Union imported $108 billion in energy supplies from Russia in 2021, accounting for about 62 percent of total consumption. About $300 billion out from the Central Bank's $640 billion national reserve cushion, which was carefully amassed over the years for a rainy day, including by forgoing spending on various government and social programmes, were frozen in an instant after the US and its allies introduced sanctions on Russia over its military operation in Ukraine. In a speech in Moscow earlier Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov characterized the freeze as blatant \"theft.\" Earlier, the Kremlin suggested that the West's actions constitute an \"economic war\" against Russia. On Monday, Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das assured that New Delhi's assets were safe and \"quite diversified,\" but said that that the example of the freezing of Russia's reserves by Western countries \"was something which going forward every country will start thinking about.\" On Wednesday, Axios reported that US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen is planning to meet with a group of senators to discuss a bill seeking to lock down $132 billion in Russian gold reserves by sanctioning transactions involving Russia and the precious commodity to eliminate loopholes through which Moscow might convert money into gold. The freeze on Russia's reserves abroad has sparked questions among media and politicians about why Russian fiscal authorities made the decision to transfer the country's hard-earned assets abroad in the first place, with some blaming Siluanov and Central Bank governor Elvira Nabiullina for the fiasco. The Central Bank has not commented on the matter, but observers have explained that some of the reserves were placed in Western banks to collect interest, instead of being held in physical cash, while securities and government bonds were held in those countries where they originated, as is standard practice. Last week, Spiegel contributer Henrik Muller warned that the scandal surrounding Russia's reserves may be a signal that the dollar's status as the de facto world currency may be coming to an end. \"Should fears spread that the US government could confiscate currency assets at any time, this could cause massive damage to the dollar...[For] countries with large currency resereves, the question arises as to whether their balances with the Fed (and other Western central banks participating in sanctions) are still safe...The country with by far the largest forex reserves is China. The Saudis and other Gulf emirates also have substantial dollar holdings,\" Muller wrote.

The ministry hasn't specified yet the location of the training centre or if any mercs were killed in the strike. A video showing the high-precision strike has been shared by the MoD: On 21 March, Russian troops hit yet another training centre for foreign mercenaries and  Ukrainian nationalists in the Rovno region with precision-guided cruise missiles. That day, over 80 mercenaries and Ukrainian nationalists were eliminated, the MoD said. The day before, 100 Ukrainian troops and mercenaries were killed in the Zhitomir region after the Russian armed forces launched a series of high-precision missile strikes on the training centre for covert operations forces of the Ukrainian military, where foreign mercs were based. Prior to that, up to 180 foreign mercenaries were killed in precision strikes against Ukrainian training centres located at the Yavorovsky military compound and near the settlement of Starichi. The Russian Defence Ministry stressed that those facilities were being used to train and organise  foreign mercenaries to fight Russian troops in Eastern Ukraine, as well as to store weaponry sent to the country by foreign nations. Russia has on multiple occasions urged foreign countries to prevent their citizens from travelling to Ukraine in order to join the hostilities there as the Russian Armed Forces conduct a special military operation in the country. Moscow warned that anyone attacking Russian troops will be  considered a legitimate target. In early March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that 16,000 foreign mercenaries were going to fight for Ukraine. He encouraged \"anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe,  and the world\" to \"come and fight side by side with Ukrainians\" against the Russian military. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has promised simplified visa and entry procedures for all foreign fighters. Russian President Vladimir Putin authorised the launch of the special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, following a request from the newly recognised Donetsk and Lugansk  People's Republics (DPR and LPR). He stressed that Moscow was left with no other choice after Kiev failed to implement the Minsk agreements and had to protect the Donbass population following continued attacks by Ukrainian forces. The president said that the key goals of the op are the \"demilitarisation and de-Nazification\" of the neighbouring country. Western countries led by the US have condemned the operation, branding it an \"invasion\" and expressed a readiness to pump Ukraine with weapons, but stopped short of pledging other military assistance, citing fears of triggering World War III.

They claim the trio was targeted by either chemical weapons or electromagnetic radiation.According to the outlet, Abramovich and at least two senior Ukrainian negotiators\u00a0\u201csuffered symptoms of suspected poisoning\u201d after a meeting in Kiev earlier this month. Their symptoms included \u201cred eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands,\u201d\u00a0claimed to people familiar with the matter, who blamed the suspected attack on \u201chard-liners in Moscow\u201d not interested in ending the conflict in Ukraine.Ukrainian officials were skeptical of the report, however. Presidential adviser Mikhail Podolyak told Reuters \u201cthere is a lot of speculation, various conspiracy theories,\u201d while Rustem Umerov, allegedly one of the three persons affected, said people should not trust \u201cunverified information.\u201dThe investigation was organized by Christo Grozev of Bellingcat, which the WSJ described as an \u201copen-source collective.\u201d Bellingcat has claimed Russia\u2019s involvement in the alleged 2018 poisoning of Sergey and Yulia Skripal in the UK and of activist Alexey Navalny in 2020. Russia designated it a foreign agent in December 2020, citing Bellingcat\u2019s ties to Western intelligence agencies and funding by the US, British and Dutch governments.\u00a0\u201cBellingcat can confirm that three members of the delegation attending the peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on the night of 3 to 4 March 2022 experienced symptoms consistent with poisoning with chemical weapons. One of [the] victims was Russian entrepreneur Roman Abramovich,\u201d the outfit tweeted on Monday.\u201cIt was not intended to kill, it was just a warning,\u201d Grozev told the WSJ. He said he saw photos of Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators that led him to suspect an attack, but could not arrange a sample in a timely manner. By the time German forensic experts were able to perform an examination, too much time had passed to detect a suspected poison, according to Grozev.Again citing people familiar with the matter, the WSJ said Western experts could not determine if the symptoms were caused by a chemical or biological agent, or \u201csome sort of electromagnetic-radiation attack\u201d \u2013 a description that sounds like the mysterious \u201cHavana Syndrome,\u201d alleged by some US spies to be the result of some kind of Russian energy weapon.The WSJ reported last week that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had asked the White House not to sanction Abramovich, because he was trying to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine \u2013 again, citing anonymous sources. Others quoted in the article weren\u2019t clear whether Abramovich was actually involved in the talks, and he was placed on the sanctions list anyway.The Yeltsin-era oil baron, who lived in the UK and owns the football club Chelsea, has reportedly been acting as a \u201cback channel\u201d between the Kremlin and Kiev, meeting with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky over the past month.Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.

Issues of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and international law were increasingly prominent in African and South Asian countries, where China had invested heavily in local grids and power plants, she said.The diplomat went on to stress that the European concept of sovereignty, in contrast, postulated \u201ccooperation where possible and autonomy where necessary.\u201d She added that nations \u201ccan only act autonomously when they are not completely dependent on others.\u201d The statement was part of a broader announcement of Germany\u2019s new national security strategy.Unsurprisingly, Russia\u2019s military action against Ukraine came very much to the fore during Baerbock\u2019s speech. The minister said none of the German officials who had been working on the strategy could have imagined that the Russian president would \u201cattack his neighbor.\u201d She accused Moscow of breaking \u201cour peace order in Europe\u201d as well as the \u201ccharter of the United Nations.\u201d In light of that, Germany must more assertively implement some of the core principles \u201cthat lead us,\u201d she proclaimed.Among those principles, she said, was a clear stance that \u201cin questions of war and peace, justice and injustice, no country, including Germany, can be neutral.\u201d She cited the references to her country\u2019s Nazi past made recently by several Russian officials, saying that it was precisely \u201cout of our history, out of Germany\u2019s guilt about war and genocide\u201d that a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d arose to always \u201cstand on the side of those whose life, freedom, and rights are being threatened.\u201dShe pointed out that Germany should disabuse itself of the old notion that there were \u201cgood and bad dictators.\u201d Berlin and its allies should instead defend their values and stance globally, she urged, but this should not preclude them from talking to authoritarian regimes. And while diplomacy was of great importance, Germany should, at the same time, not allow such regimes to gag it just because it was \u201cdependent in terms of economy or energy.\u201dThe second core principle outlined by Baerbock was an improved ability to act, which she said went hand in hand with international unity, especially within the EU and among G7 and NATO member states.Last but not least, security policies should go beyond the purview of Germany\u2019s defense and foreign ministries, Baerbock argued. Areas such as infrastructure investment and trade also contributed to the security of the German state, she emphasized. She concluded that, to ensure that security, Berlin would have to become more inventive, pragmatic, and able to \u201cthink outside the box.\u201d"},{"uuid":"4367c811-dd3f-4010-af4b-3c0ed6efd6af","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/sport\/552390-arnold-schwarzenegger-russia-ukraine-maryana-naumova\/","title":"Schwarzenegger accused of breaking promise on Ukraine by \u2018world\u2019s strongest girl\u2019 (VIDEO)","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/62387aae85f540168f309a3b.jpg","subtitle":"Former Arnold Classic powerlifting sensation Maryana Naumova addressed Arnold Schwarzenegger in a video response to the American's message to the Russian people","content":"Arnold Schwarzenegger's much-publicized message to Russians does not reflect the reality of overdue military action in Ukraine, a former teenage phenomenon at the bodybuilding legend's Arnold Classic has told him while accusing the US over the Gulf War.Maryana Naumova said she handed Schwarzenegger letters and evidence of turmoil in Ukraine when she met him after bench-pressing 330lb at the Classic as a 15-year-old in 2015.Now an influencer, Naumova\u00a0claims Schwarzenegger gave the materials to an assistant and assured her that\u00a0he would \"work on\" what she describes as attacks on\u00a0citizens\u00a0by the Ukrainian army and neo-Nazis.In a video message to Schwarzenegger,\u00a0the Master of Sports of Russia\u00a0explained that she had been to Ukraine more than 20 times since 2014.Maryana Naumova, world powerlifting champion, responds to Arnold Schwarzenegger's message to the people of Russia. pic.twitter.com\/yqCY8IFIdvTwo regions in the historic mining area of Donbass declared independence from Kiev in April 2014, leading to the Ukrainian government launching what it called an \u201canti-terrorist operation\" in response to the formation of the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics (DPR and LPR).New 'battalions' of volunteer fighters \u2013 many with nationalist backgrounds \u2013 accompanied the troops sent to deal with the rebels.Months of fighting ensued, including\u00a0heavy shelling in the cities of Donetsk and Lugansk and civilian casualties and heavy losses reported on both sides.Kiev and the Donbass forces accused each other of war crimes.

Two days later, the Defense Ministry reported detecting and neutralizing another mine off Igneada, a town near the border with Bulgaria.The Romanian Navy similarly reported on Monday that fishermen spotted a mine floating around 70 kilometers (43 miles) off the coast.

Wind and currents can carry such mines to the western parts of the Black Sea, the FSB warned.Responding to Turkey\u2019s report about the discovered mine on Saturday, the Ukrainian Navy accused Russia of \u201cparalyzing the free navigation for all Black Sea countries\u201d and \u201cendangering the lives of civilian sailors.\u201dMoscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

His apparent call for ousting the Russian president was no exception last week.","content":"Fox News host Tucker Carlson has echoed President Joe Biden's words \"for God's sakes, this man cannot remain in power\" in the latest episode of his show\u2026 although unlike POTUS, the anchor did not direct them against Russian President Vladimir Putin, but rather Biden himself. Carlson pointed out inconsistencies in Biden's latest speeches, namely his denial of the fact that many of the things he said last week were immediately walked back by the White House in an apparent damage control effort. And as soon as POTUS claimed that he was not in fact walking back his statements, he did it again\u2026 by denying he was serious about ousting Vladimir Putin at the end of his \"major\" speech in Poland last week. The conservative TV host further noted that as much as no one wants to make \"fun of [Biden's] age or his diminished condition\", there is no room for mistakes when the world is \"on the cusp of a war with a nuclear-armed power\". Carlson thus argued that it was high time to replace Biden using the 25th amendment, which allows the vice president to take over if the president dies or is unable to fulfil his duties properly. Biden used the phrase, repeated by Carlson, during his speech in Poland on 26 March as he seemingly called for Putin to be ousted. The White House later claimed that Biden was not calling for a \"regime change\" in Russia after already correcting POTUS several times that week after his remarks created the impression that US troops might be deployed in Ukraine and that the US might use chemical weapons against Russia.

While repeatedly denouncing the sanctions against Russia, China itself has faced threats of restrictions from the US if it refuses to condemn Moscow.","content":"China's Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said on Saturday that the sanctions against Russia are \"outrageous\" and spoke against NATO's eastward expansion, according to Reuters. \u201cThe sanctions against Russia are getting more and more outrageous\", he said at a security forum in Beijing. Le Yucheng added that Russian citizens were being deprived of overseas assets \"for no reason\". \"History has proven time and again that sanctions cannot solve problems. Sanctions will only harm ordinary people, impact the economic and financial system...and worsen the global economy\", he stressed. Like many other high-ranking Chinese officials, he acknowledged Moscow's concerns over NATO, saying the alliance should not expand further to the east, forcing a nuclear power like Russia \"into a corner\". At the end of 2021, Russia published its main security demands for NATO, calling for legal guarantees of NATO's non-expansion eastward and Ukraine's non-participation in the alliance. Moscow also requested that NATO not establish military bases in post-Soviet countries. The proposals additionally contained a demand for non-deployment of NATO strike weapons near Russian borders and the withdrawal of the alliance's forces in Eastern Europe to its 1997 frontiers. Meanwhile, shortly before the publication of the Russian proposals, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated that Ukraine is a sovereign country that must determine its own future, and the decision of its accession to the alliance would only be made by its government and the 30 NATO member states. Since the start of the Russian special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, over 2,700 new sanctions have been introduced against Moscow, nearly doubling the pre-existing number. Despite China not having explicitly expressed its support for Russia, officials in Beijing have condemned the sanctions pressure imposed by Western countries, with Chinese officials noting that the Kremlin's security concerns over NATO's eastward expansion are justified and should be respected. Earlier this week, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce Gao Feng noted that trade restrictions destabilise the world market, saying that Beijing is determined to \"take the necessary measures and protect the legitimate rights and interests of its companies, engaged in ordinary trading activities\". According to him, the restrictive measures undertaken against Russian businesses would not only \"fail to resolve security problems, but can also have an extremely negative impact on consumers\", which \"creates additional difficulties for the global economy, which is undergoing a recession\". During a recent phone call between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the former warned his counterpart about the consequences that await China in case of support for Russia. The assistance that Beijing can offer Moscow has been an object of concern in Washington, as China's ability to supply analogues of Western goods that have fallen under sanctions could minimise the negative effect of the restrictions. Apart from that, Russia and China were said to be mulling further financial cooperation that could include an increase of mutual payments in national currencies as a way to avoid the pressure that the dollar deficit puts on the Russian economy.

In a statement released last Tuesday, Grossi warned that the Chernobyl plant employees were operating \"under enormous stress without the necessary rest.\"On top of that, on March 9 the facility's power supply was cut, with staff having to switch on backup diesel generators to ensure that the cooling system functioned normally. Five days later, one of the power lines supplying the plant with electricity was restored. According to the Russian military, the outage was caused by Ukrainian shelling of a nearby electrical substation.Kiev has also accused Russian troops of setting fire to the woods surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, releasing radioactive particles into the air.On March 4, Russian forces took over the Zaporozhskaya Nuclear Power Plant in the south of Ukraine.

According to the report, citing sources within the discussions, a so-called 'Tiger Team' is considering what to do if Russia crosses into NATO territory to destroy convoys carrying weapons and aid to embattled Ukraine.  The committee, which reportedly meets three times a week in closed meetings, is also considering how to respond if Russia moves into neighboring countries such as Moldova and Georgia, as well as how to prepare European countries for a massive new influx of refugees. Those eventualities are said to be important to Biden's closed door meetings with leaders of the 29 other NATO nations expected on Thursday in Brussels.  According to sources, the team of officials was established in a memo signed by Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, on February 28, four days after the special military operation began.  An earlier incarnation spent months secretly preparing the US administration for the possibility of the current Russian action in Ukraine. That group was instrumental in developing playbooks for harsh sanctions, troop buildups in NATO countries, and arming the Ukrainian military. The Tiger Team is examining what threshold would compel the alliance to deploy military force in Ukraine as one of its main concerns. This comes after Biden made it clear that he is adamantly opposed to doing so, believing that a direct involvement in ongoing conflict would spiral it out of control, adding that it would be \"World War 3.\"  Sullivan's memo also reportedly organized a second team of officials to look at long-term potential for the US to better its geopolitical position as a result of the current standoff over the Ukraine crisis. According to the outlet, the White House believes that the special military operation will hurt Russia in the long term, hurt its economy, and alienate potential allies for years, but some officials reportedly caution that it is too early to tell. In recent weeks, the White House and NATO headquarters have ramped up warnings that Russia may resort to its most potent weapons in its special military operation. Also on Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned that if weapons of mass destruction were used inside Ukraine, it would have \"dire consequences\" for NATO. He also reportedly mentioned that one question being investigated is whether collateral damage would be considered an \"attack\" on NATO under the organization's charter, evoking the military response. The claims are made as Russian troops discover secret biolaboratories in Ukraine, that were funded by the US. And according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, these laboratories could be used to develop biological weapons.  Russia has also repeatedly stressed that it has disposed of its stockpiles of chemical weapons, while the US has its stockpiles. On Tuesday, the Russian embassy in the nation noted that Washington deliberately delayed the destruction of their remaining 3% of chemical weapons. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with CNN this week that the Russian government would only resort to using nuclear weapons in the event of an \"existential threat\" to its own existence. On Thursday, Biden will attend an extraordinary NATO summit on Ukraine and meet with G7 leaders, according to the White House. He will also attend a European Council summit and hold a bilateral meeting with European Council President Charles Michel, before ending his trip in Warsaw on Saturday where he will discuss humanitarian issues with his Polish counterpart.

However, how should one interpret this type of behaviour - is it a show of force or a sign of weakness?","content":"Since the beginning of Moscow's military operation in Ukraine, the video hosting platform has targeted Russian state-run media outlets, and even the channels of Soviet television and radio Gosteleradiofond, which broadcast archive materials recorded before 1999. In one of its most recent restrictions against Russian channels, YouTube blocked the account of pranksters Vovan and Lexus after the release of their conversations with UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Home Secretary Priti Patel, which provided a glimpse into London's behind-the-scenes position regarding the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. While YouTube cited a \"violation of community rules\", critics have slammed the video hosting platform for dealing a blow to free speech in yet another act of mass censorship in the wake of the events in Ukraine. What could be behind YouTube's decision to censor the Russian pranksters? The move could be due to the West's desire to silence an embarrassing story that could highlight things that the UK would prefer not to be made public. Hudak goes on to recall how Wallace mentioned that Britain has troops in Estonia, Poland, and Lithuania, and is \"happy to be with Ukraine\", thus \"suggesting the potential for British troops\" on Ukrainian territory. This came just ahead of US President Joe Biden's slip-up in Poland, where he spoke to US soldiers in Rzeszow and told them that when they \"get there\u201d (to Ukraine), they will see \"women and young people [...] standing in front of a tank\". Hudak criticised the influence that Western government entities appear to have over social media platforms - YouTube in particular. But he also had a straightforward explanation as to why the West wants to shut down any alternative sources of information. \"The danger in the information is that it is true or at least encourages people to question the agenda and policy of the establishment. When the public begins to disagree with or at least question its government\u2019s actions and overall strategy and goal, it becomes far more difficult for that government to continue with its plan. To prevent this from happening, the establishment must concentrate the diversity of information available to the public, which is why we see mass censorship taking place at the moment\", he explains. Joseph Oliver Boyd Barrett, emeritus professor at Bowling Green State University, offered his own look at the decisions by YouTube and other major social media platforms. According to him, the Western media's aim is to \"exclude\" information it deems unsuitable for the official narrative \"in ways that do not immediately attract charges of outright censorship\".  However, that was easier to do without the Internet, and now that the global web provides access to points of view that may differ from the mainstream, tougher tools become necessary. But why are alternative viewpoints being targeted at all? According to Barrett, it's all about \"monopolising the public conversation\". \"The collusion of mainstream media is assured through their shared political and economic interests, by threats and incentives, and the operations of intelligence agencies that routinely penetrate media with their own people, recruit media operatives, ply media outlets with privileged information or disinformation and so on\", he explains. In the wake of Big Tech companies tightening the screws and attempting to shape the narrative in their preferred way, it might be useful for media companies and outlets to invest in building \"a profile on other platforms that are not part of the Big Tech conglomerate\", Taylor Hudak suggests. But this alone would not be enough, he adds. YouTube blocked Vovan and Lexus' channel on Saturday, effectively removing the videos the two pranksters had shared that revealed their conversations with top UK officials. In the phone talks, the two pretended to be Ukrainian PM Denis Shmygal and managed to gain some insight into the British view of the Ukraine crisis. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace happened to share details on British arms supplies to Ukraine and views on Kiev's \"plans\" regarding its nuclear programme, while Home Secretary Priti Patel pledged to strip Russian tycoons of their assets and ensure the support of the UK's allies for Ukraine. After the videos emerged online, the UK officials immediately asserted that they had been \"doctored\" and that they are part of \"Russian propaganda\", calling on YouTube to remove them. YouTube was quick to comply, just as it did when Western countries imposed a slew of anti-Russian sanctions, particularly demanding that online access to Russian media outlets be restricted, while allowing anti-Russian ads on the platform.  This move by Big Tech firms was slammed by Russia as censorship, with media watchdog Roskomnadzor condemning the social media platforms' actions as something that \"not only violate[s] Russian law but also contradict generally accepted norms of morality\".

Therefore, the BCAA has provisionally suspended all Certificates of Airworthiness of those aircraft,\u201d explained the statement.On March 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law making amendments to the Air Code of the Russian Federation. The bill, introduced by the government and aimed at supporting Russia\u2019s transport industry in the face of external sanctions, has allowed Russian air companies to register their leased foreign jets inside the country. The bill has also given them an opportunity to receive domestic airworthiness certificates.However, at least one Russian air carrier, Red Wings, has already made a pledge to return all eight of its leased Airbus planes to their owner. Experts speculate that the company\u2019s decision has to do with the fear that its own jets abroad might be arrested. Red Wings heavily relies on Russia\u2019s domestic Sukhoi Superjet 100 offering.A new round of sanctions against Russia followed the Kremlin\u2019s decision to launch an\u00a0attack\u00a0on Ukraine. The operation started on February 24. Soon after, the United States, Canada, and all EU states closed their airspace to Russian jets. Moscow has responded reciprocally. As a part of anti-Russian sanctions, Boeing and Airbus have suspended any maintenance of all aircraft leased by Russian carriers.According to Russian authorities, the sole goal of the restrictions is to hurt the Russian people.

The LV Volt, which was unveiled on Tuesday, was said to be an expression of support for Russia\u2019s attack against Ukraine by symbol-conscious critics.The collection came under fire for using a common symbol of electricity, the lightning bolt, as a motif.

Like dozens of other luxury brands, it has suspended sales of its goods in Russia, shutting down over 100 outlets earlier this month \u2013 and presumably, the development of the LV Volt collection required much more than a month.In a similar incident, Elle Russia was accused this week of being pro-war after running headlines about Gen Z on the cover of its March issue."},{"uuid":"4c522079-9ebe-4169-98cd-6a98df05e4e1","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220320\/russian-forces-close-to-defeating-ukrainian-nationalist-battalion-donbass-defence-ministry-says-1094034710.html","title":"Russian Forces Close to Defeating Ukrainian Nationalist Battalion 'Donbass', Defence Ministry Says","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e6\/03\/14\/1094035205_0:0:3874:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_8c51abee6e2fb6e212a6b1256638184e.jpg?source-sid=rian_photo","subtitle":"One of the main declared goals of the Russian special operation in Ukraine is to de-Nazify the country.

He elaborated that up to 60 of the battalion\u2019s fighters were killed, two tanks, while three armoured transports and six pieces of artillery and mortars were destroyed during Russian troops\u2019 push towards Nikolskoye settlement. Konashenkov added that Russian troops were cooperating with units of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) as they advanced towards Nikolskoye. On a separate note, chairman of the Russian Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin has announced that a probe will be carried out to determine whether leaders of the nationalist battalions captured during the operation in the Ukrainian city of Izyum committed any war crimes. Ukrainian nationalist battalions were formed in the aftermath of the West-backed coup in 2014 to wage war against the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR), which declared independence amid fears of oppression of the Russian-speaking population. These battalions largely consisted of members of nationalist and radical groups and were often caught committing war crimes against the local population (including the volunteer \"Donbass\" battalion). The new nationalist-minded authorities largely turned a blind eye to these crimes, failing to prosecute even members of the notorious \"Tornado\" battalion, which was disbanded precisely because of the atrocities it was committing. The war crimes of another notorious battalion, \"Aidar\", were well documented by the Amnesty International non-profit back in 2014, but none of its members were probed and punished for their deeds. The de-Nazification of Ukraine is among the two main declared goals of the Russian special operation, which was started by President Vladimir Putin on 24 February. The operation was launched following a request from the DPR and LPR to protect them against attacks by Ukrainian forces. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

But in no way should this provoke any kind of political reaction from FIDE,\u201d added Peskov, who is also chairman of the board of trustees of the Chess Federation of Russia. \u00a0\u201cWe call on FIDE to reconsider this decision and remain outside of politics, thereby confirming the international prestige of this international chess organization,\u201d he added. \u201cOf course, we do not agree with such a decision [to ban Karjakin].\u201dKarjakin himself reacted by suggesting that FIDE wanted to deny him the chance to compete at the upcoming Candidates Tournament, where the winner will set up a shot at the world title against Norwegian star Magnus Carlsen.The Chess Federation of Russia has said it will appeal the ban, although Karjakin is not optimistic of success against an organization which is headed by a Russian president, Arkady Dvorkovich.Karjakin contested the world title with Carlsen in New York in 2016, losing a tense battle on tiebreaks after the best-of-12 match had finished level.A former world rapid and blitz chess champion, Karjakin was born in the city of Simferopol in Crimea, and switched to represent Russia in 2009.He was a vocal supporter of the reunification of Crimea with Russia following a 2014 referendum.At the onset of the military operation in Ukraine last month, Karjakin penned an open letter to President Vladimir Putin, thanking him for \u201cfighting for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine with its ruling regime, which has put the security of all of Europe and our country at risk, for the sake of its political goals and ambitions.\u201cI express to you, our commander-in-chief, full support in protecting the interests of Russia, our multinational Russian people, eliminating threats and establishment of peace! I wish you the speedy fulfillment of all the tasks assigned to our valiant army,\u201d added Karjakin.Since Russia began its operation, partly entering Ukraine via Belarus, athletes from the two nations have faced sweeping bans from numerous sports federations following recommendations from the International Olympic Committee (IOC).FIDE has banned Russia and Belarus from any team events \u201cuntil further notice,\u201d although players from the two countries can compete in a neutral status under the FIDE flag."},{"uuid":"4922602d-711f-4fdd-89cc-385ef1a7d129","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/business\/552620-india-buys-russian-oil\/","title":"India snubs US call to isolate Moscow","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623c765385f54047bb542ea0.jpg","subtitle":"The country buys more Russian oil despite pressure from Washington","content":"India\u2019s largest oil and gas company, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), bought three million barrels of Urals crude oil from Russia on Wednesday, the Deccan Herald newspaper reported citing trade sources.According to the publication, the oil was purchased through European trader Vitol at an undisclosed discount.This is the second time the Indian company has bought oil from Russia since Western sanctions were imposed on Moscow over the conflict in Ukraine.

The supermarket chain boss pointed out that price hikes have been particularly evident when it comes to items such as milk, whose production involves several stages, with the cost of every part of the process rising.He concluded that high food prices were here to stay and that it could be argued that, systematically, \u201cFood has been too cheap for too long.\u201d He said the pressure on chains was \u201crelentless and coming at us from all angles\u201d as they tried to keep prices down.Explaining the ballooning costs, he blamed rising oil prices, worker shortages, and the falling supply of Russian fertilizers and Ukrainian sunflower oil over the past month.Walker suggested that the UK government could implement measures to take the heat off retailers. He urged that the energy price cap on households could be extended to businesses, which he said would translate into some \u00a3100m in savings on consumers.

Ukraine, meanwhile, claims to have killed some 16,000 Russian troops and destroyed hundreds of tanks, armored vehicles and artillery guns.

Some 23,000 volunteers from 37 nations had expressed interest in fighting, Rudskoy said. But Donbass officials refused those offers, he added. Ukrainian officials have offered a similar estimate for its own newly created foreign legion, with Ukrainian Brigadier General Kirill Budanov putting the number at more than 20,000.Russia\u2019s military operation followed a seven-year standoff over Kiev\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Moscow\u2019s later recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

The House minority leader then went on to criticise the statements Adam Schiff made regarding the Hunter Biden story. On 14 October 2020, less than a month before the 2020 presidential election, the New York Post published an expos\u00e9 on the second son of Joe Biden. The story was based on a trove of emails and documents it obtained from a laptop purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden. It said Hunter took his computer to an IT store in Delaware, but never returned to collect it. The owner of the store first alerted the FBI about the contents of the laptop.Several emails showed that Joe Biden was seemingly involved in the business dealings of his son in Ukraine during his tenure as vice president of the United States, something the New York Post maintained potentially constituted a conflict of interest. The documents also showed that the younger Biden reportedly used his family's name to benefit himself \u2013 he allegedly asked for money from Beijing, promising that his father would improve US policy on China.Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook prevented users from sharing the New York Post's expos\u00e9 amid its release. The story was branded fake news that could potentially influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential race. Both Bidens declined to comment on the issue.Adam Schiff and other prominent Democrats have called the article a Russian \"smear\". A group of 51 former senior intelligence officials wrote a public letter, saying that the laptop story has \"all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation\" without providing any proof for their hypothesis. After the election, Hunter Biden said that the laptop could have \"absolutely\" belonged to him, but said he never took it to an IT store and suggested the device was perhaps stolen or hacked by Russian intelligence.The president's younger son has since become a subject of investigation into his tax affairs. He is also being probed by the Justice Department about whether he potentially violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act while working with foreign companies. On Friday, the New York Post contacted the 51 former intelligence officials and asked them whether their stance on the Hunter Biden remains the same following the publication of The New York Times' story. Forty-four people declined to comment or didn't respond, two individuals couldn't be reached, and five people said their views on the issue have not changed. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

The campaign to demilitarise Ukraine is taking place via precision strikes against military infrastructure facilities, areas where troop formations have been deployed, including airfields, command posts, arsenals and depots containing weapons and equipment, as well as battles between Ukrainian and Russian forces, Rudskoy said in a briefing Friday. \"At present, the Ukrainian Air Force and the system of air defences have been almost completely destroyed. The country's naval forces have ceased to exist,\" the officer said. Rudskoy warned that Russia would \"not leave unattended\" any attempts to supply Kiev with new aircraft and air defence systems, and warned NATO not to implement a no-fly zone. Ukraine's armed forces have suffered 30,000 losses - 14,000 dead and 16,000 injured during the same period, according to the Main Operations Directorate chief. These losses have affected all 24 groupings of the ground units which existed before the operation began, Rudskoy added. He reminded listeners that Ukraine's armed forces and National Guard formations consisted of 260,200 servicemen before the Russian-led operation began. The grouping of Ukrainian forces fighting in the Donbass against the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Militias has lost more than 7,000 troops, accounting for more than a quarter of its total strength, Rudskoy said. The Russian military has stopped these forces from being replenished by taking control of railway junctions and key roads. The supply of missiles and ammunition, fuel and food to these units has been almost completely stopped, he said, with remaining stockpiles of weapons and fuel in the relevant areas being destroyed in strikes. The Ukrainian military no longer has organised reserve forces available, and losses are being compensated by territorial defence troops who do not have the necessary training, which increases the risk of higher casualties, Rudskoy said. The Main Operations Directorate chief also reported that 113 captured tanks and other armoured vehicles, as well as 138 trophy Javelin and 67 NLAW anti-tank missile systems have been transferred to the Donetsk and Lugansk militias by Russian forces. Russian military intelligence estimates that a total of 6,595 foreign mercenaries and terrorists from 62 countries have been concentrated in Ukraine to date. \"Today, the number of foreign mercenaries is decreasing. This was facilitated by high-precision strikes against bases and camps where they were being trained. Just at Starychi and the Yaroviv base on 13 March, more than 200 were killed and over 400 were injured,\" he said. The officer warned that the rules of warfare do not apply to mercenaries, and that they would be destroyed without mercy. Rudskoy also reported that more than 23,000 foreign nationals from 37 governments have volunteered to fight alongside the DPR and LPR units, but that the republics have rejected their help. \"We proposed to the LPR and DPR leadership that they accept this assistance, but they said they would defend their lands themselves. They have enough forces and means to do so,\" he said. Commenting on the situation in Mariupol, the major south-eastern Ukrainian coastal city which has seen heavy fighting in recent weeks, Rudskoy said that more than 7,000 Ukrainian militants, among them Azov, Aidar and Right Sector neo-Nazi units, are concentrated in the area, taking cover behind civilians whom they use as human shields. The Main Operations Directorate chief said that more than 270 settlements previously controlled by Ukrainian forces are now controlled by Lugansk and Donetsk forces, and that the latter are now operating alongside Russian forces to liberate settlements west of Donetsk. Rudskoy said Ukraine's military created a heavily echeloned, well-fortified defence zone in the Donbass over the past eight years consisting of a \"monolithic\" network of concrete structures, forcing advancing Russian and militia units to conduct heavy strikes against enemy strong points and reserve positions before proceeding to avoid losses. Rudskoy gave his assurance that the Russian military operation in Ukraine will continue until the goals outlined by the Russian president are met.

I'm worried for the staff there when I see this turmoil.\"We've tried to focus on a proposal which align the ownership of the club with long-term investors with a deep history with the club. If you look at the proposal we put forward, keeping it an entirely British finance proposal is core to that.\"There are plenty of very successful clubs financed by international investors but in this case, after two decades of exceptional success by the club, the club has the fanbase with the resources to support the club to maintain that success. That's what's very unique about this proposal.\"We've looked at the club in the past. There have been occasions where there were rumours of the club being available but ultimately all those projects were shelved.\"Our bid is all domestic, we don't have any foreign investors so we're using domestic capital which I think is quite noteworthy. We all attend the matches with our kids.\"I don't think any of us are coming purely because we're fans or purely because we love football.\"It's really driven by the commercial opportunities. But it is a long-term investment.\"Centricus underlined their long-term commitment in a statement looking to \"continued success\" for the Premier League's third-placed team.\u201cThe intention is to maintain and support existing management on both the business and sporting operations of the CFC Group,\"\u00a0they said.\u00a0\"We intend to maintain the existing strategy direction.\"The group said Chelsea had been operating\u00a0under \"challenging conditions\" and\u00a0emphasized the importance of a \"smooth and stable ownership transition\"\u00a0alongside open dialogue.\u201cCentricus would be focused on ensuring that [Chelsea continue] to achieve sporting excellence, high level of community support, transparent governance, financial sustainability, fan engagement and exemplary custodianship,\"\u00a0they added.Centricus have also pledged to \u201cmaintain an elite global brand\u201d while continuing to significantly invest in the Chelsea women's team, the club's highly successful youth academy and its charitable Chelsea Foundation.\u00a0Chelsea have been for sale since March 2, when Abramovich confirmed his intention to sell six days after Russia's attack on Ukraine began.\u00a0The businessman\u00a0was sanctioned\u00a0in the UK on March 10, with Boris Johnson's Conservative government claiming\u00a0that Abramovich has direct ties to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.Abramovich has always denied that he has done anything to warrant being punished.The 55-year-old's\u00a0UK assets \u2013 including Chelsea \u2013 were frozen\u00a0and the club was ordered to operate under the terms of a\u00a0government license.The club wants the government to reconsider the potentially crippling measures, which include a ban on selling tickets and merchandise, agreeing new contracts with players, making signings and spending more than $26,000 on travel to away games.Abramovich is prohibited from\u00a0profiting from the sale and had already announced that a $2 billion loan to the club was being written off.\u00a0Several other bids for Chelsea are thought to remain on the table. Major League Baseball side LA Dodgers' part-owner Todd Boehly, the Ricketts family who own\u00a0rivals Chicago Cubs and British property magnate Nick Candy are involved in some of the potential bids, as are the\u00a0Saudi Media Group.The\u00a0government is said to be keen to agree a swift sale subject to the Premier League's ownership tests.\"For us, you simply can't buy a club and expect to sell it in five or 10 years,\" said\u00a0Al-Bassam.\"The expectations from the fans, the regulators, be it the FA or Premier League or from the government, would be not to have a sale of this club in the next five or 10 years.\"So this would have to be a very, very long-term commitment.

The ministry cited \u201cthe talks moving into the practical dimension,\u201d as the reason for the change.Medinsky explained the announcement of a de-escalation on the approaches to Kiev, among other reasons, by the fact that key decision makers are based in the capital.Russia's top negotiator also underlined that there is a difference between de-escalation and ceasefire.\u201cThis is not a ceasefire, this is our desire to gradually come to a de-escalation of the conflict, at least in these areas, .... and we understand that there are people in Kiev who need to make decisions,\u201d\u00a0he said.\u201cWe don't want to put this city at additional risk,\u201d Medinsky stressed.David Arakhamia, Medinsky\u2019s opposite number in the Ukrainian delegation, said Kiev had sought a security guarantee from a number of nations that would work not unlike NATO\u2019s mutual self-defense commitment.He named the UK, China, the US, Turkey, France, Canada, Italy, Poland and Israel as possible guarantors, and claimed some of them have given their preliminary agreement to serve in that capacity.The proposed security pledge will not apply to the parts of Ukraine whose status remains in dispute, Arakhamia said. These include Crimea, which Russia considers its territory, and the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics, which Russia recognized as sovereign states and whose forces are taking part in ongoing hostilities.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu remarked that he hoped that the outcome of the negotiation would soon lead to a ceasefire and a sustainable political resolution of the crisis.Last month, Russia\u00a0launched a military attack\u00a0on Ukraine over Kiev\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Kiev says the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."},{"uuid":"5330679d-b76f-4fdf-9420-c91808c0c01a","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220327\/serbian-president-calls-western-demands-to-support-sanctions-against-russia-unfair-1094237195.html","title":"Serbian President Calls Western Demands to Support Sanctions Against Russia Unfair","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e5\/03\/07\/1082275073_0:0:3071:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_dd39e201be68ab848a505f8ff2ef6584.jpg?source-sid=reuters_photo","subtitle":"BELGRADE (Sputnik) - Western demands for Serbia to support sanctions against Russia are unfair, since the country is a sovereign state, is not a member of the European Union, and has itself survived foreign aggression by NATO forces in 1999, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Sunday.","content":"The president added that Belgrade behaves in accordance with its national interests even if it runs counter to plans of other countries.

Earlier in March, the Serbian government supported 4 of the 13 points of a UN resolution condemning Russia's special military operation in Ukraine. All of those points did not imply the introduction of sanctions against Moscow. In 1999, an armed confrontation between Albanian separatists from the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian Army led to the bombing of what was then the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, by NATO forces. The operation was undertaken without the approval of the UN Security Council and was based on allegations by Western countries that the Yugoslav authorities were allegedly carrying out ethnic cleansing of Kosovo Albanians.

It turns out that, as the US moves to lift sanctions on that nation by rejoining the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), global energy security is more important than the much-hyped Iranian nuclear threat.It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a Democrat or a Republican, when it comes to using economic sanctions as a weapon, politics don\u2019t matter. The case of Iran and its nuclear program stands out as a clear example of this. Under the administrations of Republican President George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama alike, the US used the alleged threat posed by that program \u2013 claimed by the US to be military in nature, but to be used for exclusively peaceful purposes by Iran \u2013 as justification to impose stringent economic sanctions ostensibly designed to compel the Iranian government to cease its acquisition and use of uranium enrichment technology.Ultimately, this policy failed in the face of Iran\u2019s refusal to yield on the issue of its rights under the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to pursue a peaceful nuclear energy program inclusive of the entire nuclear fuel cycle. By building a case for sanctions as the only alternative to military action to remove the alleged threat posed by the program, the US had boxed itself into a corner where, when sanctions had demonstrably failed, the only choice left was one the US was in no position to make.This is the true background to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the JCPOA. It wasn\u2019t US sanctions that brought Tehran to the negotiating table. In fact, it was the failure of these sanctions that forced the US to back down from its previous policy position, which was intolerant of all Iranian uranium enrichment capability. For Iran, the JCPOA was a win-win situation: it was able to retain its uranium enrichment program, albeit with significant temporary restrictions and under strict monitoring from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which employed an intrusive on-site inspection regimen, as well as to have US and international sanctions lifted.The respite of a sanctions-free existence for Iran, however, was short-lived. There were two realities hard-wired into the JCPOA, which, from an American perspective, always doomed the agreement from being successfully brought to term. First and foremost were the so-called \u201csunset clauses\u201d which placed stringent restrictions on the scope and scale of Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment program, including limitations on the number and quality of the centrifuges it could use in this effort. As the JCPOA matured, these clauses would eventually be lifted, allowing Iran to install more efficient centrifuges in greater numbers.Given the stated purpose of the JCPOA was to deny Iran a so-called \u201cbreakout\u201d capability (defined as the period needed by Iran to produce enough fissile material for the production of a single nuclear device should all restrictions be removed) of less than one year, it was clear that once the sunset clauses were lifted, this breakout calculation would diminish significantly, to a period of months or even weeks. Herein lay the poison pill of the deal: the US continued to maintain that Iran had been operating a nuclear weapons program that had been mothballed in 2003, but which had never been declared by Iran and, as such, had continued to exist.If one accepts this narrative at face value \u2013 Iran denies having ever had such a program, and the IAEA has not been able to prove that one had ever existed \u2013 then the expiration of the sunset clauses would put Iran on a fast track toward acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. This was the logic that underpinned Obama\u2019s admission, made in April 2015 during an interview with the US broadcaster NPR, that the US would \u201creconsider\u201d the viability of the JCPOA as an instrument of US policy on the eve of the clauses expiring. In short, the JCPOA was simply a place-holder, designed to buy the US time to find a way to convince Iran to give up the very thing the deal enshrined: its uranium enrichment program.The other fatal flaw of the JCPOA was that, from an American perspective, it lacked the strength of a formal treaty. Unable to get Senate ratification of the deal, Obama enacted it through his inherent executive powers, which meant that any successive administration could simply revoke the relevant executive order and the JCPOA would, from the US perspective, be no more.This is precisely what happened when Donald Trump was elected president. In little over a year, citing Israeli intelligence that Iran had an undeclared nuclear weapons program, and highlighting the risk of allowing Iran access to the technologies it would lawfully be able to possess once the sunset clauses expired, Trump simply withdrew from the JCPOA, instituting a policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d through stringent economic sanctions that specifically targeted Iran\u2019s energy sector. Citing the hand-in-glove relationship between the Iranian economy and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the Trump administration labeled that entity a terrorist organization, opening it up to targeted sanctions.The decision to leave the JCPOA was not well received by either Iran or the other members of the agreement (Russia, China, France, the UK, Germany, and the European Union). Neither was the US policy of maximum pressure against Iran, which employed so-called \u201csecondary sanctions\u201d against any nation or company that did business with Iran. The tension the policy caused regarding US relations with its European allies, combined with the deterioration of security in the Persian Gulf region, prompted the administration of President Joe Biden to commit to rejoining the JCPOA as soon as possible after coming to power in early 2021.The negotiations between the US and the remaining parties to the Iran nuclear deal have been going on for nearly a year now. What should have been little more than the signing of an executive order undoing the actions of the Trump administration turned into a veritable effort by the Biden administration to renegotiate the JCPOA that, among other things, extended the timeframe of the \u201csunset clauses\u201d and retained the non-permanent characteristic of US participation, i.e., no binding treaty, but merely a renewal of executive powers that could at any time be rescinded.By the fall of 2021, the negotiations had got bogged down, with many observers questioning whether a deal could be reached at all. And then came Russia\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine.Overnight, the subterfuge of US concern over Iran\u2019s nuclear capability dissolved in the face of brutal economic reality driven by the US-led effort to sanction Russia, inclusive of its oil and gas energy sector. Concerns about global oil supplies suddenly made Iranian oil, which the US had tried to block from the world market through sanctions, an invaluable geopolitical asset. The need to get that oil into the global energy supply chain had the effect of eliminating most if not all the objections the US had been raising regarding JCPOA renewal. The US has even sweetened the potby reportedly being open to revoking the \u201cterrorist\u201d label from the IRGC. And, in a final display of fecklessness, it has agreed to Russia\u2019s demands that any economic interaction between Moscow and Tehran protected by the JCPOA cannot be subject to the US-led sanctioning of Russia because of its Ukrainian operations.This still leaves the temporary status of any US commitment to the Iran deal on the table. This, however, is non-negotiable\u2014there is simply no way Biden would be able to get the JCPOA in its original form through the Senate ratification process. Iran and the other parties to the agreement should have no illusions about any US commitments in this regard. There will come a time in the not-so-distant future when an American president, whether he\/she is a Democrat or a Republican, will be compelled, for domestic political reasons, to withdraw from the JCPOA once again. The inconsistencies inherent in the US policy formulation \u2013 that Iran has an undeclared nuclear weapons program that would be accelerated once the sunset clauses of the JCPOA expire \u2013 demand as much.That this reasoning is purely political in nature, however, has been exposed by how quickly the Biden administration rushed to finalize a renewal of the JCPOA. Apparently, creating the conditions to keep the price of gasoline down at the pumps in the lead-up to the midterm elections later this year trumps any genuine concern about the threat posed to international peace and security by a rejuvenated Iranian uranium enrichment program."},{"uuid":"5688afe8-b469-48e7-bc33-34fd5dab33eb","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552757-pranksters-ukraine-uk-youtube\/","title":"Russians pranksters banned by YouTube after request from UK government","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623f19b22030272aa759f925.jpg","subtitle":"Vovan and Lexus\u2019 channel has been shut down for violating the platform\u2019s community guidelines","content":"Notorious Russian pranksters Vovan and Lexus, whose most recent high-profile\u00a0targets were UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace and Home Secretary Priti Patel, saw their channel removed by YouTube on Saturday.The duo shared, on social media, a message they had received from the US social media giant, citing unspecified violations of \"community guidelines.\"\u201cChannels responsible for serious breaches are being removed in order to keep the platform safe for all users,\u201d it read in Russian.\u201cSadly, everything has been deleted,\u201d Vovan confirmed to the Russian newspaper Izvestia, claiming the ban was another example of anti-Russian censorship on the part of the UK.

Flight MH17 of Malaysia Airlines crashed on 17 July 2014, in eastern Ukraine while en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam. All 298 people on board, mostly Dutch citizens, were killed. Kiev and the self-proclaimed republics in the Donbass region, where the plane was shot down, have blamed each other for the incident. The investigation into the MH17 crash was conducted by Dutch prosecutors and the Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT). The international group of investigators claims that the plane was downed by a Buk missile belonging to the Russian armed forces, something Moscow denies. Russia was excluded from the joint probe, but conducted its own investigation and said it had provided the JIT with evidence, including radar data, showing that the plane had been shot down by a Ukrainian Buk missile. The trial of four suspects in the case \u2014 Russian nationals Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinsky and Pulatov, as well as Ukrainian national Leonid Kharchenko \u2014 is taking place at the Schiphol judicial complex near Amsterdam.

Energy has become an important pillar of India's special and privileged relationship with Russia during the Narendra Modi era.","content":"India has brushed aside US warnings against energy ties with Russia amid the ongoing military operation in Ukraine.  Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has categorically stated that if Western energy firms vacate the Russian market, New Delhi will not hesitate to take advantage of the opportunity. The oil minister, who spoke with Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak on 12 March on energy matters, replied to parliamentarians wondering if there would be diplomatic and economic ramifications if India increased energy investments in Russia. New Delhi sees rising opportunities in Russia at discounted rates as Shell, British Petroleum, ExxonMobil, and several others responded to Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine by exiting their investments worth around $30 billion from Russian energy fields. India's public sector units \u2014 ONGC Videsh Ltd, Indian Oil Ltd, Bharat Petro Resources Ltd, Oil India Ltd -- have invested over $16 billion in oil and gas fields such as Sakhalin-1, Imperial Energy, Vankorneft, TaasYuryakh, and License-61 since the early 2000s.  Russian entities, including Rosneft, own a majority stake in the Indian refiner Nayara Energy. The Indian minister said that some of those Indian investments are very profitable. Using the Sakhalin-1 project as an example, the minister said that the Indian firm ONGC Videsh Ltd has earned over $3.7 billion with a 20% investment of $337 million two decades ago. ExxonMobil operates the Sakhalin-1 project on behalf of an international consortium of Japanese, Indian, and Russian companies.  \"In response to recent events, we are beginning the process to discontinue operations and developing steps to exit the Sakhalin-1 venture\", the Texas-based ExxonMobil said on 1 March. The BJP politician, however, underlined that the media reports about Western firms already withdrawing their investments from Russian energy fields are not authentic. The minister assured the parliamentarian that there would be no adverse impact on hydrocarbon energy agreements with Russia. India's top refiner, Indian Oil, signed an agreement to purchase 3 million barrels of crude oil from Russia this month.  Although India buying Russian oil wouldn't violate US sanctions against Moscow, the Indian government has planned payment in national currencies to continue trade in other commodities. The US has imposed sanctions on several Russian financial institutions. When asked if rupee-ruble transactions will harm New Delhi's relationship with Washington, Minister Puri responded to parliamentarians by saying that India and the US have a robust bilateral energy partnership that will continue to grow. The minister said that energy imports from the US are around $13.5 billion, including $10 billion in crude oil. \"As far as oil imports from Russia are concerned, contrary to what is being played up in the press, these are minuscule\", Puri said. Indian oil and gas public sector undertakings imported approximately less than one percent of its total crude oil imports from Russia in 2021-2022 (April 2021 to January 2022). On 15 March, when a reporter asked about India's decision to buy discounted Russian oil, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the US message to \"any country\" is to \"think about where you want to stand when the history books are written\". Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a special military operation in the Eastern European country on 24 February at the request of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. President Putin stressed that the operation was started to stop the eight-year-long atrocities by Kiev in Donbass, adding that Russia's goal is the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine.

An informed source at the Ministry of the Armed Forces told L\u2019Opinion that Vidaud was set to be sacked in the summer over \u201cFrench shortcomings\u201d regarding the crisis in Ukraine, but chose to quit immediately instead. Vidaud\u2019s sacking is reportedly related to a \u201clack of understanding of the issues\u201d and \u201cinsufficient briefings\u201d. BMFTV and other French outlets have subsequently confirmed L\u2019Opinion\u2019s reporting of Vidaud\u2019s departure. A diplomatic source cited by AFP defended the general, who was put in his post in the autumn of 2021, saying his agency was responsible for \u201cmilitary intelligence on operations, not intentionality\u201d. The source said Russia was deemed not to have the means to launch a full-scale operation in Ukraine, and that \u201cwhat happened proves him right\u201d. Before his appointment to the Main Directorate of Military Intelligence, Vidaud served as head of French Special Operations Command \u2013 the body responsible for coordinating the missions of French special forces units. Vidaud\u2019s resignation follows comments made to Le Monde by Thierry Burkhard, chief of defence staff of France\u2019s armed forces, that French military intelligence failed in its assessment of the \u201cRussian threat\u201d to Ukraine. Criticism of Vidaud\u2019s performance has not been limited to Ukraine. Last year, after the United States and Britain pulled the rug out from underneath a French submarine contract with Australia worth $65 billion, French military intelligence and other agencies were lambasted for failing to predict the loss of the contract. Brigadier General Jacques de Montgros, who presently commands the European Union\u2019s training mission in the Central African Republic, is expected to replace Vidaud, according to L\u2019Opinion\u2019s information. President Emmanuel Macron and Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian have sought to prevent the crisis in relations between the West and Russia over Ukraine from spiraling any further out of control. Earlier this week, after US President Joe Biden called for regime change in Russia and dubbed Vladimir Putin a \u201cbutcher\u201d, Macron said he \u201cwould not use those words\u201d and called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. \u201cIf we want to do that, we can\u2019t escalate either in words or action,\u201d he said. French opposition have criticised the Elysee Palace over its weapons deliveries to Ukraine, with National Rally leader Marine Le Pen calling on Europe to stick to diplomacy instead. Putin and Macron have spoken repeatedly since Russia began its military operation in Ukraine. On Wednesday, the Russian president briefed his French counterpart on measures to provide humanitarian aid and to evacuate civilians from the conflict zone, and told him that Ukraine\u2019s nationalist fighters would need to lay down their arms to resolve the crisis in Mariupol.

The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

Nevertheless, the devil is, as usual, in the details.\"As Hon\u2019ble Members would be aware, the tense situation between Russia and Ukraine erupted into conflict on 24 February 2022. The root causes for this are complex, going back to range of issues including the security architecture, political governance and inter-state politics. To that was added the challenges of implementing understandings reached earlier. What is pertinent to note is that the hostilities placed the Indian community of 20,000 plus in direct danger. Even while we were participating in the global deliberations of this evolving situation in the UN Security Council, the pressing challenge was to safeguard our citizens and ensure that they were not in harm\u2019s way\", said Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in his address to the upper-chamber of the Indian Parliament (Rajya Sabha) on March 15, 2022.Thus, it is not the changing geopolitical equilibrium or arguments over India\u2019s stance on the conflict but the evacuation of the Indian community in Ukraine, most of whom pursued medical studies in Kiev, Kharkov and Sumy, that in fact most seemed to bother the nation\u2019s leadership.Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government launched \"Operation Ganga\", the aim of which was to return Indian nationals home. The exercise entailed a \"whole of Government\" approach and joint efforts undertaken by the Ministry of External Affairs with all the Embassies concerned, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Defence, the National Disaster Response Force, Indian Air Force and private airlines. What should be mentioned is that the Russian political leadership and the military on the ground were in constant contact with New Delhi's officials and succeeded in providing Indian students and professionals with humanitarian passage.Unfortunately, a final year medical student of Kharkiv Medical University Naveen Shekarappa Gyanagaudar lost his life. That tragedy requires a deep investigation, which Russia immediately promised to conduct. However, \"Operation Ganga\" has eventually been undertaken successfully, with the close India-Russia interaction in a tough situation having served as another example of mutual understanding in resolving urgent issues.Although the Indian leadership, and public in general, obviously concentrated on the humanitarian dimension of the conflict, more pragmatic considerations have been in place. These considerations concern India\u2019s positioning in the international arena (including such venues as the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly) and speculation about the mounting number of sanctions imposed on Russia by the West as well as the ways to face the future ramifications for India-Russia cooperation, engendered by those constraints.Hardly anyone in Russia expected India to fail its historical ally in such circumstances. And it didn\u2019t. New Delhi\u2019s position during the vote on the resolutions condemning Russia\u2019s actions in the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly respectively has been steadfast and coherent \u2013 India abstained from taking part in\u00a0West-sponsored resolutions that sought to deplore in the \"strongest terms\" Russia's \"aggression\" against Ukraine.Hence, India remains committed to its strategic culture, expressed most clearly in the principle of \"multialignment\" (a reference to the earlier principle of non-alignment), where the emerging world power persists in seeking ground for fruitful cooperation with all nations and avoids taking a stand on controversial issues. India proved its traditionally independent stance and should have dissuaded those political pundits who mistakenly regarded its historically weighted position, as an inclination to bolster its ties with the West at the expense of New Delhi and Moscow's bilateral relations.Economic cooperation seems to be a rather complicated issue, as it requires handling multiple structural constraints stemming from the very nature of the interconnected global markets. Operating in this environment entails the elaboration of coherent and consistent strategies, responding to the newly emerged challenges.Indian decision-makers in the economic field, as well as business circles, pay close attention to the Western sanction policies, the mass media provides detailed information about the measures undertaken by the Bank of Russia, the ruble exchange rate and the functioning of the Russian financial markets.What disturbs them most is possible structural problems in the world economy and the global network of supply chains. For instance, the Reserve Bank of India (acting as the country's central bank) has expressed concern about the impact of economic sanctions on the dynamics of energy prices, volatility in the financial markets and inflation rates.Indian market players themselves are unwilling to join the Western-led sanction campaign but are wary of repercussions deriving from further cooperation with Russia. That is why the State Bank of India (the nation\u2019s top lender) has stopped processing any transactions involving Russian entities which are subject to international sanctions imposed on Moscow\u00a0due to its significant international presence and the need to comply with US and EU regulations.However, it's no surprise that some notable economic agents should have acted in line with Western initiatives so as not to endanger India\u2019s long-term plans on attracting investments and advanced businesses from around the world. It is of Russia\u2019s interest to have relations with a rapidly developing economy with the steps undertaken by the SBI being of marginal importance in the whole context of India-Russia economic ties.One may wonder what interests India could pursue in the current situation? First of all, New Delhi has another chance to take advantage of the Russian pivot to the East, since this time Moscow has no option but to finally embark on boosting its ties with the non-Western world in practice. While Russia and Europe are strongly interconnected from geostrategic perspective, and that is why they are doomed to restore European security architecture and find consensus on other fields of cooperation, nowadays there is a room for both reaffirming historical commitments and exploring new spheres of partnership in order to make it comprehensive in full effect.Secondly, it is high time India took real steps to lessen the so-called \"Russia\u2019s dependence on China\". This narrative of \"Russia rapidly becoming subordinate to China\" has been circulating around Indian official, academic, expert and media circles in recent years. There is unlikely to be a better chance for New Delhi to enter the game decisively by establishing new businesses, launching joint projects and increasing investments so as to pick up its desired winnings.Finally, India could demonstrate that despite being under tough pressure from the West, and primarily from the US, it is ready to take advantage of its special privileges in its partnership with Russia. There will be no better argument in fighting back against speculation within some circles in Moscow that India is gradually tilting towards the West.\u00a0The environment we will have to operate in is, no doubt, uncertain. However, it is quite clear\u00a0that for today Russia should be satisfied with the stand India took in the crisis. The interaction between Moscow and New Delhi outweighs thousands of supportive words and statements.India and Russia are going to further interact within a new international order since the old one does not seem to work anymore. The way it will look depends on the political will of the leadership of the two nations and \u00a0the motivation of both Indian and Russian entrepreneurs.\u00a0"},{"uuid":"59b53305-d56d-4bae-a517-3b83ff8f8252","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552423-japan-kuril-islands-negotiations\/","title":"Russia scraps WW2 peace  talks with Japan","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6238b98785f5400fe1365327.jpg","subtitle":"Moscow has broken off talks to formally end its WWII conflict with Tokyo, citing Japanese sanctions against Russia","content":"Russia has ended an arrangement dating back to 1991 that allowed Japanese citizens to visit the Kuril Islands without a visa, and has broken off talks with Japan on formally ending the Second World War, citing Tokyo\u2019s \u201copenly unfriendly\u201d conduct in sanctioning Moscow over the conflict in Ukraine.Due to the what it called the\u00a0\u201cobvious unfriendly nature of the unilateral restrictions imposed by Japan against Russia in connection with the situation in Ukraine,\u201d the Foreign Ministry announced on Monday that it would \u201cterminate\u201d the visa-free regime and \u201cdoes not intend to continue negotiations with Japan on a peace agreement.\u201dRussia also withdrew from talks on establishing joint economic activities with Japan in the Southern Kuril Islands, and will block Tokyo\u2019s partner status in the Black Sea Economic Cooperation organization.\u201cAll responsibility for the damage to Japan\u2019s bilateral cooperation and interests lies with official Tokyo, which deliberately opted for an anti-Russian course instead of developing mutually beneficial cooperation and good neighborliness,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said.Japan joined the US-NATO economic embargo against Russia after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine last month.

The comments were made by Sitaram Yechury, general-secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M), during a press conference in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir. He was visiting Kashmir for his party's 12th state conference. \"We agree with Russia when it says that the war in Ukraine is actually a war between Russia, the US and NATO. Ukraine has become its unfortunate theatre,\" said Yechury, referring to Russia's ongoing military operation in Ukraine. The CPI-M has also said NATO has gone back on promises it once made to the former USSR president, Mikhail Gorbachev, that there would be no eastward expansion of NATO. Yechury also argued that, despite the fact that Georgia and Ukraine are not NATO members, \"in both of these countries, NATO has developed a complete infrastructure. And today 175,000 NATO combat troops are posted on the ground near the Ukraine-Russia border even before the war.\" Commenting on how to get out of the Ukrainian crisis, Yechury said that his party wants the crisis to be resolved through talks. However, he termed India's foreign policy of becoming subservient to interests of the United States. \"India is completely aligned with American foreign policy. The Modi government is involved in the American strategic and military alliances whether it's the QUAD or Indo-Pacific or regional joint military exercises or defence acquisitions \u2013 their relationship has been cemented,\" Yechury claimed. He said India has been reduced to become a junior partner of the USA\u2019s global strategic team. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February in an effort to de-Nazify the country. So far India has abstained from voting in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) twice, and in the UN General Assembly once over resolutions regarding the Russian military operation. The steps included abstention from a UN resolution that attempted to label Russia the \u201caggressor\u201d in the ongoing crisis. The CPI-M also adopted a resolution in Srinagar targeting various of the policies propounded by the federal government, led by the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). The party demanded an early hearing of a petition in the Indian Supreme Court challenging the withdrawal of Jammu and Kashmir's special status in August 2019. The party, in its resolution, also alleged that journalists in Kashmir working for \"different media outlets face intimidation and harassment\". Weighing in on the ongoing discussion of a Bollywood film titled, 'Kashmir Files', the resolution stated \"promoting Kashmir Files is an attempt to polarise the people further\". The Bollywood film, which is about the migration of Kashmiri Pandit community because of the anti-India insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir, has been promoted by several politicians of the BJP.

Meanwhile, London's own state-controlled BBC has covered all conflicts involving the UK in living memory, including the \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d pretense for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which turned out to be false.While UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has condemned Russia\u2019s military offensive against Ukraine, his office has not supported all of the west\u2019s retaliatory measures. In a briefing on Tuesday, Dujarric said that Guterres does not support proposals by US lawmakers to exclude Russia from the UN Human Rights Council, and that such a move would set \u201ca dangerous precedent.\u201d"},{"uuid":"5af32b1e-8ca9-4c7c-8ab7-b45d57b18e9b","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552392-ukrainian-doctor-denies-castration\/","title":"Ukrainian doctor comments on his \u2018castration of POWs\u2019 interview","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623871272030275b4a6089de.jpg","subtitle":"The shocking claim was not true and was an emotional outburst, he said, after apparently having received threats","content":"A Ukrainian doctor who claimed during a live interview that he had ordered his volunteer unit to castrate captured Russian soldiers has stated that his words were not true.

The deal is aimed at decreasing Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian energy supplies by partly replacing them with American fossil fuels.However, environmentalists take issue with the idea of swapping one source of fossil fuels for another instead of \u201ctransitioning to affordable clean energy.\u201d\u201cAllowing for the expansion of new and expanded gas export facilities would lock in decades of reliance on risky, volatile fossil fuels and spell disaster for our climate and already overburdened Gulf coast communities,\u201d Kelly Sheehan, senior director of energy campaigns at the Sierra Club, an American environmental organization, said in a statement on Friday.Sheehan concluded that it was only by \u201creducing reliance on fossil fuels\u201d that countries could \u201cstop being vulnerable to the whims of greedy industries and geopolitics.\u201dEchoing the above warnings, Kassie Siegel, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Climate Law Institute, equated \u201cpushing new toxic export facilities and decades more methane gas\u201d with a \u201cdeath sentence for those on the frontlines of the climate emergency.\u201d She added that more American LNG \u201cwon\u2019t solve Europe\u2019s current crisis\u201d anyway.\u201cApproving more export terminals, pipelines and fossil fuel production only throws fuel on the fire of our burning world,\u201d she said.According to the International Energy Agency, to keep global temperatures from rising 1.5C above the pre-industrial era, humanity should stop building new fossil fuel infrastructure now. Scientists believe that if the said threshold is exceeded, the planet will experience a dramatic rise in dangerous heatwaves, flooding, droughts, and wildfires that could potentially displace populations.Speaking in Brussels on Friday, President Joe Biden announced that the LNG supply deal would ensure that \u201cfamilies in Europe can get through this winter,\u201d while putting a dent in Russia\u2019s gas revenue, which, according to Biden, Moscow pumped into its \u201cwar machine.\u201d He also claimed that the plan would not undermine his administration\u2019s ambitious climate goals, saying that the conflict in Ukraine would serve as a \u201ccatalyst\u201d for broader introduction of renewables.Under the deal, America will provide an additional 15 billion cubic meters of LNG to the European Union this year alone. This cited amount of gas is expected to supplant roughly a tenth of gas imported from Russia. Brussels has revealed plans to further ramp up LNG imports from the US and several other countries down the road, in a bid to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels."},{"uuid":"5ba42548-db63-4c89-bdfe-d52904cb6f85","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/sport\/552576-russia-ukraine-hector-bellerin-israel-palestine\/","title":"Premier League footballer brands attention on Ukraine \u2018racist\u2019","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623b5a8285f5404780152305.jpg","subtitle":"Hector Bellerin compared the attack to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and wars in Yemen and Iraq","content":"Arsenal\u00a0wideman and Real Betis loanee Hector Bellerin has spoken out on Russia's attack on Ukraine and questioned why the conflict has been given more media attention than others in Palestine, Yemen and Iraq.The 27-year-old former Spain international accused people who selectively turn their focus on the attack while ignoring conflicts in other countries of racism\"It is quite difficult to see that we are more interested in this war than in others,\"\u00a0the Spaniard told La Media Inglesa via\u00a0Marca.\"I don't know if it is because they are more like us or because the conflict can affect us more directly both economically and in terms of refugees.A post shared by He\u0301ctor Belleri\u0301n (@hectorbellerin)\"The Palestinian war has been completely silenced, no one speaks about it.\"Yemen, Iraq... now Russia not being able to play in the World Cup is something that other countries have faced for many years.\"Governing body FIFA's ban on Russian teams that Russia's Qatar 2022 qualifying playoff semifinal against Poland has been called off, with their opponents, who had refused to head to Moscow, given a bye.Bellerin went on to suggest that turning \"a blind eye to other conflicts and now to have this position\" is \"racist\".\"It also reflects a lack of empathy for the number of lives lost in many conflicts and we are prioritizing those that are near to us,\u00a0he said.Joining the\u00a0Premier League side from Barcelona's famous La Masia academy in 2011, Catalonia native Bellerin spent a decade at Arsenal before leaving for Real Betis on a season-long loan last year.\u00a0Bellerin's remarks on Russia and Ukraine echo those made by world squash number two Ali Farag\u00a0after winning the Optasia 2022 Squash Champion title in London at the Wimbledon Club earlier this month.\u00a0\"One more thing that I know is going to get me in trouble, but you know we've all seen what's going on in the world at the moment with Ukraine and nobody is happy about what's going [on],\u201d\u00a0Farag said\u00a0following his victory against world number six Diego Elias.Egyptian squash player @AliFarag:\u201cWe\u2019ve never been allowed to speak about politics in sports but all of a sudden it\u2019s allowed.

With petrol and diesel prices at the pumps soaring by 50p per litre since this time last year, driven in part by Western sanctions on Russia over its operation to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" Ukraine, the UK Chancellor has reportedly been mulling a 5p-per-litre cut in fuel duty in the spring mini-budget. Furthermore, Sunak had indicated earlier that his Spring Statement - one of two that the HM Treasury makes annually to Parliament upon publication of economic forecasts \u2013 would contain new measures that would show the government is prepared to \u201cstand by\u201d budget-squeezed families. That, according to the Chancellor, includes \u201csecurity for working families as we help with the cost of living,\u201d as well as \u201cthe security of more resilient public finances\u201d. In interviews ahead of the Spring Statement, Sunak highlighted that he was aware high prices at the pumps are \u201cone of the biggest bills people face\u201d. Appearing on Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge On Sunday Sunak had stated: As prices at the pumps have soared to record highs of \u00a31.66 per litre for petrol and \u00a31.77 for diesel, slashing fuel duty has long been demanded by Conservative backbenchers. In the UK, fuel duty is 57.95p a litre, plus 20% VAT, and has remained frozen for 12 years. Labour shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds was cited by UK media outlets as saying that the mulled 5p per litre cut would save families no more than an average of \u00a32 per tank of fuel. According to The Resolution Foundation, even a 10p fuel duty cut would reverse only around a quarter of the past year\u2019s rise in costs. Another option open to the UK Chancellor is to raise the threshold at which workers start paying national insurance contributions (NICs) - Britain's social security tax. If the threshold, which will stand at \u00a39,880 from April due to the 1.25 per cent NI rise earmarked for health and social care, is brought closer to the personal allowance of \u00a312,570 that applies to income tax, it would ensure that around 150,000 lower-income workers are exempt. Sunak could also choose to defer the increase planned for this April.  To support poorer households, the British Chancellor has also been facing calls to raise the value of universal credit by more than the 3.1% set for April, originally based on September\u2019s inflation rate. Furthermore, to offer business support amid high energy costs, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has been urging Sunak to turn his \u201csuper deduction\u201d, offering tax savings on business investment, into a permanent deduction to offset a rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25% planned from April 2023. The super-deduction tax break, intended to spur business investment, was a tax relief introduced for two years for expenditure from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023. A company can claim back up to 25p for every pound invested in \u2018qualifying\u2019 machinery and equipment, and was touted by Rishi Sunak as a \u201cdirect way to help businesses invest.\u201d As Rishi Sunak presents his update on the economy based on the forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) there are expectations for a weaker economic outlook amid high inflation set to eat away at the spending power of consumers. According to the Bank of England, inflation will reach 8% this April, possibly later on peaking at 10%. Furthermore, many British households will face what financial expert Martin Lewis called a \u201cfiscal punch in the face\u201d when the energy price cap increases from 1 April for approximately 22 million customers. Those on default tariffs paying by direct debit will face an increase of \u00a3693 from \u00a31,277 to \u00a31,971 per year. Prepayment customers will see an increase of \u00a3708 from \u00a31,309 to \u00a32,017.

This will strengthen the international financial isolation of Russia and become an effective tool for maximum counteraction to Russian aggression in the financial sector,\u201d the statement reads, as cited by RIA Novosti.After the start of Russia\u2019s military operation in Ukraine, the US and its allies began restricting and banning Russia\u2019s largest banks and state-owned companies, and froze around $300 billion in Russia\u2019s forex reserves. While the EU banned operations to manage reserves and assets of the Bank of Russia, European countries are still allowed to carry out transactions with the regulator in cases of urgent need.Earlier this month, the EU disconnected seven Russian banks from SWIFT. The list includes VTB, Rossiya, Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Sovcombank, and VEB.RF.SWIFT itself is not a payment system, but an electronic document management tool. Using it, banks can send orders to their foreign partners and correspondent banks for currency transfers, as well as confirming transactions and issuing guarantees for their clients.Disconnecting the Russian central bank from SWIFT could sever the regulator\u2019s ability to conduct international transactions. For instance, it may affect Russia\u2019s ability to repay its sovereign debt, operations with which have, for now, not been subject to sanctions. Cut off from SWIFT, Russia could still pay its obligations in rubles, but international credit rating agencies have said that this may constitute a default, which would make borrowing funds for Russia in the future more difficult and expensive.However, SWIFT has alternatives. In Russia, it is the SPFS (Financial Message Transfer System), which has similar functionality and allows the transmission of messages in SWIFT format. China, which has no plans to cut ties with Russia, has its own payment system, CIPS (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System), while other countries, including India, have been working on setting up payment mechanisms which would allow national currency transactions with Russia.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"},{"uuid":"5eb59ec3-00f3-4142-aa46-9a698091a46f","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220323\/cnn-promotes-neo-nazi-commander-us-sanctions-raise-dollar-concerns-1094099602.html","title":"CNN Promotes Neo-Nazi Commander; US Sanctions Raise Dollar Concerns","image":null,"subtitle":"The Reserve Bank of India Governor has expressed grave concerns over the Western seizure of Russia's assets arguing that his nation would be crippled if they faced similar consequences.

The spokesman declined to comment on the subject of countries which could serve as guarantors of Ukraine's security, advising reporters to instead contact his \"colleague,\" presidential aide and Russian top negotiator Vladimir Medinsky. Medinsky is expected to provide additional information later in the day, according to Peskov. Peskov's comments follow Medinsky's remarks at a press conference in Istanbul, Turkey on Tuesday following negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation, during which he told reporters that the two sides had brought up a proposed commitment by Kiev to reject the idea of \"returning\" Crimea and the Donbass to its jurisdiction using force.  Ukraine was said to have proposed holding 15 years of bilateral talks on Crimea and the port city of Sevastopol, and to have brought up the concept of a permanent neutral, non-bloc, non-WMD-possessor status secured by international guarantors. Russian deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin, who was present alongside Medinsky at the Istanbul talks, said that Russia would dramatically reduce its military operations in the regions of Kiev and Chernigov in a bid to \"increase mutual trust\" and create the preconditions for further negotiations. Medinsky was tapped by President Putin to head up the Russian negotiating team at talks in Ukraine which began in late February in Belarus. Russia began a military operation in Ukraine on 24 February after months of shelling, sniper and sabotage attacks by Ukrainian forces against the Donbass republics, whose status as sovereign nations Moscow recognized on 21 February. The military operation, being waged in conjunction with Russia's Donbass allies, followed months of escalating tensions between Russia and Kiev's Western patrons, and a refusal by the US and NATO to agree not to expand into Ukraine. The Ukrainian crisis began in February 2014, when US and EU-backed forces toppled the country's unpopular but democratically elected government in a coup and proceeded to try to incorporate the country into the Western economic and security blocs. The coup prompted the majority of residents in Crimea to vote in a referendum to break off from Ukraine and rejoin Russia, and sparked a bloody civil war in the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Lugansk after local residents similarly attempted to break away from Kiev's control. Pro-Russian protest movements in the eastern and southern Ukrainian regions of Kharkov, Nikolayev and Odessa were brutally suppressed, with over three dozen activists burned alive after neo-Nazi gangs set fire to the trade unions building in Odessa in May 2014, and dozens more imprisoned, tortured, murdered and disappeared elsewhere by nationalists and security forces.

However, she stated that the US dollar, traditionally considered the world reserve currency, is not likely to suffer an \u201cimminent demise.\u201dStill, depending on how long the crisis in Ukraine lasts, there could be larger effects, Gopinath said.Touching on the prospect of Russia\u2019s sovereign debt default, the senior IMF official said its potential impact on the global economy would be limited and would not pose a \u201csystemic risk,\u201d because the \u201cnumbers that we\u2019re looking at are relatively small from a global perspective.\u201d On the other hand, for Russia, a default would have long-term consequences, Gopinath added.\u201cWhen you\u2019ve defaulted, reentry into the market is not easy. And that can take a long time.\u201dThe sanctions placed on Russia over the past month have effectively cut the country\u2019s ties to the Western financial system, banning most transactions except for debt repayment operations and oil purchases, at least for now.The measures also froze around $300 billion that Russia holds in foreign currency reserves abroad. International credit rating agencies earlier this month lowered Russia\u2019s rating to pre-default, predicting that Moscow will not be able to fulfill its obligations to foreign creditors. Russia has so far averted default, making a $117 million interest payment on two dollar-denominated bonds last week. Media reports also said that Russia made another $66 million debt payment in US dollars on Tuesday.Moscow has repeatedly stated that it is fully capable of repaying its debts, and could even make the transfers in the national currency, the ruble, if other options are exhausted.However, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Services, there is still the danger of missed payment, as the exemption from sanctions on Russia\u2019s debt operations expires on May 25, while Moscow still has payments worth $100 million due on May 27. Moody\u2019s said that after that date, Russia\u2019s creditors \u201cwill require a specific license to continue to receive debt repayments, which will further impair investors\u2019 ability\u201d to receive their funds.Russia has accused the US and its allies of trying to engineer an artificial default, since the country has the money to pay its debts. Moscow says it is the Western financial institutions that are in default, because by freezing the country\u2019s assets, they are failing with regard to their obligations.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"},{"uuid":"60fc1575-83c6-4397-9700-2a4697e0c4a3","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220331\/us-stocks-plummet-500-plus-points-as-biden-announces-hefty-oil-reserves-release-1094371067.html","title":"US Stocks Plummet 500-Plus Points as Biden Announces Hefty Oil Reserves Release","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e6\/03\/1f\/1094371784_0:0:3071:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_f6a0d40341bed55fd5159a96af3da7db.jpg?source-sid=reuters_photo","subtitle":"On Thursday, the White House announced that it would begin the daily release of some 1 million barrels of oil, totaling around 182 million barrels of oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve over the next six months.

Market data showed that although consumer prices rose a bit in February amid intensified pricing pressures, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose by 0.4% (excluding food and energy data).  The PCE number falls in line with the expectations of the Federal Reserve. Ken Polcari, a managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors, told Yahoo Finance that although the number was on target for the Fed, the US central bank will likely become more aggressive in raising interest rates to address inflation.    \"The PCE number came out today, which is the Fed\u2019s preferred number, and although that was right on target, it was higher than it was last month, and the sense is it is going to continue to go higher, therefore you are seeing some weakness,\" Polcari told the outlet.

While such a move is a historic first for the bloc, it is substantially more modest than the EU army proposed by France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron.The \u201cEuropean Union just approved Strategic Compass,\u201d Latvian FM Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds announced, following a meeting of European defense and foreign ministers in Brussels earlier in the day. The plan provides a \u201cnecessary toolbox for the EU to become a real geopolitical defense and security player together with NATO,\u201d he said, and is only the \u201cbeginning of the journey\u201d for the bloc\u2019s military future.\u00a0The plan itself has been around since 2020, when it was proposed by the European Council. Since then it has been criticized by those Eastern European countries that prefer to rely on NATO and its US muscle for their defense needs, and by commentators in neutral Ireland, who sought assurances that only peacekeeping missions be undertaken by the bloc, and that the UN be given a central role in decision-making.However, the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine has hastened the plan\u2019s adoption. In its current form, Strategic Compass is aimed at improving cooperation between existing European militaries, boosting cooperation with NATO, consolidating cyber-defense capabilities, and facilitating joint investment in research and development.\u00a0However, it also facilitates the creation of a 5,000-strong \u201crapid deployment capacity\u201d of EU troops, marking the first step taken by the bloc toward creating a common military. This step toward militarization is significant, especially as it comes less than a month after the European Commission announced it would supply Ukraine with \u20ac450 million ($497 million) worth of arms and ammunition.A strategic assessment by the EU identified\u00a0\u201cregional instability, conflict, state fragility, inter-state tensions, external influences, [and the] destabilising impact of non-state actors\u201d as reasons for drafting the plan, suggesting that the bloc may, at some point and in some capacity, intervene in future conflicts akin to the one in Ukraine.\u00a0Doing so would be an unprecedented step for the union, but Strategic Compass still falls short of the united military some leaders support. Macron has long been a proponent of creating an EU army and lessening the bloc\u2019s dependence on NATO, an alliance he called \u201cbrain dead\u201d back in 2019.Macron renewed his push for an EU fighting force independent of NATO earlier this month, stating that the conflict in Ukraine had \u201cchanged the era\u201d for the European Union. However, the Eastern Europeans are still content to rely on NATO for their defense needs, with Polish Deputy Prime Minister Piotr Glinski telling The Telegraph on Saturday that the EU was not ready for conflict, and that Macron\u2019s comments risk \u201cdestabilizing Europe.\u201d"},{"uuid":"620f983e-7232-4a1e-ad6a-c149e7cd6b61","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220330\/china-outburst-of-ukraine-crisis-stems-from-long-lasting-differences-over-security-in-europe-1094323041.html","title":"China: 'Outburst' of Ukraine Crisis Stems From Long-Lasting Differences Over Security in Europe","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e6\/03\/1e\/1094325821_0:0:3072:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_6f5422e212857341537d9a6d623382ee.jpg?source-sid=not_sputnik_photo","subtitle":"According to the Chinese Foreign Minister, it is necessary to build an effective and sustainable security system in Europe through dialogue and negotiations.

The Chinese minister added that Beijing welcomes the first results that were achieved during the Russian-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul on Tuesday and supports the continuation of the negotiations aimed at de-escalating tensions in Ukraine.  \"We support the efforts being made by Russia and all other sides to avert a full-scale humanitarian crisis,\" the Chinese top diplomat said, as quoted by the ministry. According to Wang Yi, it is necessary to build an effective and sustainable security system in Europe. The Russian top diplomat is currently on a two-day visit to China to take part in the third ministerial conference of Afghanistan's neighbouring countries and the expanded troika on Afghanistan (Russia, China, Pakistan and the US). The geopolitical situation has changed dramatically since the beginning of Russia\u2019s special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February. As Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly explained, Moscow had to begin the operation after all diplomatic means to settle the conflict between Kiev and the Russian-speaking Donbass region were exhausted. Putin said that the operation was aimed at protecting civilians in Ukraine's breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk (which were recognized by Russia as sovereign nations on 21 February) and also to demilitarise and de-Nazify the entire Ukrainian territory since numerous radical neo-Nazi armed groups had been operating there and presented a serious threat to Russian-speaking population. The operation also followed months of ineffective negotiations between Moscow and the West about NATO's eastward expansion (including prospects for Ukraine's membership in the bloc) which Russia has always categorically rejected as a threat to its national security.

Sputnik: It's been one month since Moscow began a special military operation in Ukraine. How do you assess Moscow's operation so far? Vijainder K Thakur: The Russian special military operation in Ukraine has gone well so far, albeit their progress appears to have slowed down. Russian forces have wrested a very significant amount of Ukrainian territory and practically removed any future threat to the Donbass area and Crimea from a surprise attack by the Ukrainian Army. Demilitarisation and de-Nazification are ongoing but slow because at the start of the war, instead of fighting Russian forces on the borders or the hinterland, Ukrainian nationalists quickly retreated to heavily populated areas. Russia has carefully calibrated its campaign to minimise civilian casualties. Russian forces are striking at nationalists entrenched in cities in close proximity to populated areas with precision-guided artillery shells and missiles. However, footage of urban structures destroyed by Russian precision strikes, occasional collateral damage and civilian casualties are being used by the nationalists and their supporters in the West to discredit Russia's forces. Ukrainian and western Information warfare directed at Russia is high-pitched. Russian forces are holding up well in the face of disinformation. There has been no breakdown in discipline. Popular support for President Vladimir Putin within Russia remains intact. China and India have not been swayed. Sputnik: Some commentators claim that Russia is losing the operation as they observed that Russia's offensive was \"largely stalled on all fronts\" in the past few days. As you monitor the operation closely, do you find a gap in the West's assessment and facts on the ground in Ukraine? Vijainder K Thakur: I don't believe the Russian operation has stalled. Far from it! Russian forces may not have made dramatic advances in the past two weeks or so, but they have tightened their grip on important cities such as Kiev, Kharkov and Mariupol. Elite Ukrainian forces in the Donbass region and further south near Crimea have been cut off from their command and resupply centres. Ukrainian forces are surrounded and their fuel and ammunition are being rapidly depleted because of Russian precision strikes on supply depots. Casualties are mounting. Sputnik: Russia and Ukraine have held several rounds of negotiations since 24 February. Now, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants to sit with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate. Do you think talks at the top at this point will bear fruit? Vijainder K Thakur: A peace agreement would have to be based on the groundwork laid by sustained and serious negotiations by officials at different levels over many days. Top leaders, overseeing the ongoing military operation, simply don't have the time to engage in sustained peace negotiations lasting days. President Zelensky can better serve his country by providing compassionate leadership through pragmatic directions to his negotiating team, rather than negotiating directly with President Putin. Sputnik: The US has delivered security assistance worth more than $1 billion in the past week alone. However, the US and NATO declined to get involved directly and remain opposed to instituting a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Many observers have predicted that the US actions in Ukraine will trigger insurgency in the country. Do you agree with this prediction? Vijainder K Thakur: First, I don't believe it's in the long-term interest of Europe or NATO to stoke an insurgency in Ukraine. They would be shooting themselves in the foot with a rather high-calibre weapon! Failure to strike a peace agreement would lead to a wider civil war than the one that has been ongoing in Donbass since 2014.  The tragedy is that the EU and NATO have so far ignored the already ongoing civil war! Sputnik: Do you foresee the war-like situation spilling over into other regions such as the South China Sea or countries such as Poland? Vijainder K Thakur: In recent history, China has not engaged in a shooting war. It has focused almost exclusively on development, leveraging its military power, when necessary, without starting a shooting war! The US and NATO have engaged in wars where a low-cost victory was assured. Having said that, I don't think the West is done pushing buttons to provoke Russia, so an accidental escalation cannot be ruled out. However, self-preservation is a strong instinct, perhaps a stronger instinct in the more affluent West than the less affluent East. Sputnik: Several European countries have started increasing their military budget. Do you think this is the beginning of efforts to decrease dependency on the US for security? Vijainder K Thakur: Absolutely! Germany's and Japan's decision to increase their military spending is not directed at Russia. It is an acknowledgment of emerging multi-polarity in the world. Russian special operations in Ukraine indicated the end of Pax Americana. Germany and Japan will now strive for their own place in the emerging multi-polar world.

On Tuesday, when asked to comment on a Reuters report that the US and its Western allies had engaged in consultations about Russia\u2019s future in the G20, Biden national security advisor Jake Sullivan said that \u201cit cannot be business as usual for Russia in international institutions and in the international community.\u201d Sources said to be involved in discussions told Reuters that the US and its allies were aware that China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Saudi Arabia or others would likely veto any Western push to expel Russia from the body.

Actually it\u2019s a forum aimed at improving economic situation and solving mostly economic problems,\u201d Vorobieva said. The G20 grouping consists of 20 members \u2013 including 19 countries plus the European Union, with the group accounting for 80 percent of world trade, two thirds of the planet\u2019s population, and nearly 90 percent of gross world product.

US President Joe Biden admitted at the NATO summit in Poland this week that the embargo on Russia would lead to food shortages.","content":"The UK's foreign secretary has hinted that the West will keep sanctions on Russia even after the end of the conflict in Ukraine. Liz Truss told The Sunday Telegraph that the measures, which include a ban on energy imports by the UK, US, and Canada, will only be lifted after a \"full ceasefire and withdrawal\" by Russian forces. She said Russia would have to pledge no further \"aggression\" against Ukraine, and would be hit with \"snapback sanctions\" if it did. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has demanded that Russia not only end the \"demilitarisation and de-Nazification\" operation it launched on 24 February, but also withdraw from the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk Peoples' Republics, which Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised on 22 February, eight years after they declared independence. Zelensky also wants Russia to cede Crimea, whose residents voted overwhelmingly to reunite with Russia in 2014 following the violent Maidan Square coup in Kiev. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said this week that the West was waging a hybrid economic \"total war\" against Russia through its sanctions regime. Truss also claimed that Russia had failed to honour previous agreements on Ukraine, a possible reference to the two Minsk accords brokered between Kiev and the Donbass republics by Russia, France, and Germany. Russia has no obligations under those accords, but Ukraine has continuously broken its pledges to pull back heavy artillery from the \"line of control\" and cease bombarding civilian areas. Kiev reportedly deployed some 150,000 troops along the border with Russia and the Donbass republics, and stepped up its artillery attacks before Russia launched its military operation. Documents captured by Russian forces detail plans for a huge Ukrainian offensive on the two breakaway states. Sanctions have already hit the West at least as hard as Russia, with prices of natural gas and oil soaring \u2014 with a knock-on effect on household bills and service station prices. US President Joe Biden admitted at the NATO summit in Poland this week that the embargo on Russia, which supplies one-quarter of the world's wheat exports, would lead to food shortages. Meanwhile, Russia is diversifying its energy export markets to China and India, while Putin announced that European Union states must henceforth pay for Russian gas in roubles, not euros or US dollars. The Russian Ministry of Defence announced on Friday that it had destroyed two-thirds of the Ukrainian Army's 2,400 armoured vehicles, two-thirds of its air force, almost all its anti-aircraft systems, and sunk or captured the entire Ukrainian Navy after a month of operations, for the loss of 1,351 soldiers killed and some 3,800 injured.

","content":"Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has denounced the West's accusations against Russia in connection with its ongoing operation to \"demilitarize and de-Nazify\" Ukraine as shameful and \u201cstupid\u201d, reminding that 19 NATO countries unlawfully bombed Serbia in 1999. Speaking on the tragic anniversary of the start of the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, on 24 March 1999, he continued: According to Serbia\u2019s president, small nations are \"always victims.\" \u201cWhen you talk about the big countries, then their morals, principles and values, which they constantly talk about, do not exist at all. If they existed, the question would arise - why not bomb those who are bigger, who did you much more damage than small ones like us\u2026 but they don't want to, because the bigger nations can retaliate,\" the Serbian leader said. Washington, its European and NATO allies have been targeting Russia with sanctions over its special operation to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" Ukraine after the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed amid increasing attacks from Kiev forces. Moscow has underscored that the goal of its operation is to exclusively target military infrastructure, with the Kremlin having no plans to occupy Ukraine. Earlier, in an address to citizens on 2 March, President Vucic said that the Serbian authorities supported four of the 13 points of the UN resolution condemning Russia's actions in Ukraine - those that do not imply sanctions. He added that Serbia did not plan to alienate the property of Russian companies in the country, but noted that the crisis due to hostilities in Ukraine is having a dramatic impact on Serbia, which has come under enormous foreign policy pressure. \"We insist on respecting the territorial integrity of states, this is our principle. On this we base the preservation of Kosovo and Metohija as part of Serbia. If we had not condemned the invasion of Ukraine, we would never again have the moral right to present this argument,\" Vucic said on the B92 TV channel. In 1999, an armed confrontation between Albanian separatists from the Kosovo Liberation Army and the army and police of Serbia led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), at that time consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, by NATO forces. Carried out without the approval of the UN Security Council, the military operation was based on the assertion of Western countries that the authorities of the FRY carried out ethnic cleansing in the Kosovo autonomy and provoked a humanitarian catastrophe there. Air strikes by the North Atlantic Alliance lasted from March 24 to June 10, 1999 and led to the death of more than 2.5 thousand people, including 87 children, and damage of 100 billion dollars.

Japan said that it is \"unsure\" how Russia will handle the required ruble payments for its energy. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz claimed last Friday that the contracts \"clearly stipulated\" that Russia's hydrocarbons should be paid in euros. For his part, French President Emmanuel Macron told journalists on Saturday that the Russian move \"is not in line with what was signed, and I do not see why we would apply it\". On 28 March, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that during the coming four days, the Russian energy corporation Gazprom is expected to develop a \"transparent and understandable system\" in both technical and logistical terms. Once the system is established, Gazprom will inform its customers about the new rules, said Peskov, adding that Russia won't provide energy for free to those \"unfriendly countries\" which refuse to pay in rubles. The same day German Energy Minister Robert Habeck said that G7 nations \"reject\" Russia's demand regarding ruble payments for energy resources and claimed the G7 is ready for \"all scenarios\" including Moscow suspending gas supplies. Dr Roberts hailed the Kremlin's decision to switch to ruble payments, asking in his blog: \"Is Russia going for the petro-ruble?\" According to the economist, Moscow could apparently be pursuing two goals: first, forcing Russia's energy customers to bypass the sanctions; second, ruble payments support the value of the ruble and frustrate the sanctioning countries' hope of causing its value to collapse. However, \"payment in rubles should be the policy regardless of sanctions\", according to Dr Roberts. During President Joe Biden's visit to Europe last week European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledged to dramatically \"reduce dependence\" on Russia's energy supplies. The bloc's flagship, Germany, also vowed to become \"more energy independent\" from Russia's oil, coal, and gas on 27 March.  Nevertheless, earlier last week Chancellor Scholz admitted that an immediate ban on Russian energy imports would prompt an economic recession both in Germany and across Europe. \"The truth is that the sanctions that have already been decided also hit many citizens hard, and not just at the gas pump\", Scholz told the Bundestag on 23 March, adding that sanctions \"must not hit the European countries harder than the Russian leadership\". In any event the EU cannot immediately replace Russia's energy which means that the bloc is likely to go through denial and bargaining and finally accept paying in rubles, according to Dr Roberts.

Western media claimed the US was negotiating a possible transfer of the weapons from Turkey to Ukraine, while offering various defense concessions in return.\u201cThis is a done deal for us. They are our property serving our defense, so it\u2019s over,\u201d the Turkish leader said, when asked about the S-400 systems.Donald\u00a0Trump's US government kicked Ankara out of the F-35 program in retaliation for buying Russian military hardware, back in 2019.Erdogan said his country\u2019s reaction to the transfer idea was well-summarized in a letter from his spokesman, Fahrettin Altun, published by the Wall Street Journal this week. The official said the current US administration\u00a0should reverse Trump's move\u00a0without any preconditions, in order to repair relations.Erodgan claimed\u00a0NATO has been revitalizated by the Ukraine crisis, remarking that French President Macron, who infamously called the military bloc \u201cbrain dead\u201d in 2019, has been proven wrong. Leaders of member states gathered behind closed doors in Brussels on Thursday to discuss their response to the Russian attack on Ukraine. Turkey reasserted its role as an essential part of the insitution, Erdogan stated.Unlike other members, Turkey has refused to impose economic sanctions against Russia and has kept diplomatic channels open with both Moscow and Kiev. Erdogan said his country had no intention of hurting itself by breaking economic ties with Russia, its most important energy supplier.\u201cI cannot leave my people in the snow in the winter,\u201d the president said, referring to natural gas supplies from Russia. \u201cI cannot completely stop our industry.\u201dHe expects the pragmatic approach to benefit Turkish tourism, saying he anticipates Russian visitors to be a major source of revenue for the industry in 2022. The financial blockade that the West has imposed on Russia has proven that Ankara was right to suggest switching payments between Turkey and Russia to their national currencies, Erdogan\u00a0added.Commenting on Turkey\u2019s mediation efforts between Moscow and Kiev, Erdogan announced that he would be talking to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky later on Friday and Russian President Vladimir Putin over the weekend or early next week.He said the two sides had found common ground on four out of six principal points of contention during their peace talks.Kiev is unwilling to relinquish official sovereignty over Crimea and the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, Erdogan explained. Zelensky previously\u00a0suggested\u00a0he could put the territorial issues to a referendum, with Moscow replying\u00a0that the proposal was not feasible under the circumstances.Crimea was reabsorbed Russia in 2014, following the events of the Kiev Maidan, while the two other regions were recognized by Moscow as sovereign republics days before it launched its attack on Ukraine in late February. Protecting Donetsk and Lugansk from Kiev\u2019s forces has been one of the official goals of the Russian offensive.Erdogan said the hostilities in Ukraine are a major crisis for the world, both due to the humanitarian damage they were causing and because of the economic impact of the anti-Russian embargoes\u00a0and Moscow\u2019s counter sanctions.Turkey was affected indirectly by the potential threat of Ukrainian mines in the Black Sea, which Russia warned may untether and float towards shipping routes through the Turkish Straits. Ankara's navy is working diligently to deal with it, Erdogan\u00a0outlined.His government\u00a0is eager to see a swift peaceful resolution to the situation, he stressed, and is doing its part to make it happen."},{"uuid":"6a5c2b4c-3860-4988-baf6-2edd18bbbca8","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220325\/gop-rep-demands-white-house-big-tech-keep-hunter-biden-records-for-possible-cover-up-probe-1094174066.html","title":"GOP Rep Demands White House, Big Tech Keep Hunter Biden Records for Possible Cover-up Probe","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e4\/0c\/10\/1081483649_0:0:1785:1293_1440x900_80_0_1_537ec0a987a02a7d8f9ccdb09da5b0c1.jpg?source-sid=ap_photo","subtitle":"The authenticity of emails extracted from the Mac that Hunter Biden reportedly abandoned at a Delaware repair shop in 2019 before it fell into the hands of the FBI, was confirmed on 16 March by The New York Times. Previously, at the height of the 2020 presidential campaign, the paper had dismissed the laptop story as \"Russian disinformation.\" ","content":"Citing the need for \u201cfull truth\u201d and \u201ccomplete accountability\u201d, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., has written letters to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, Chief of staff Ronald Klain, *Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, as well as multiple former US intelligence officials, and others, demanding that they preserve all Hunter Biden-related records. Issa has been calling out the mainstream media and social media over a \u201cconspiracy of monumental size\u201d regarding the censoring of the Hunter Biden laptop story in the run-up to the 2020 Presidential Elections. These materials, according to the republican politician, would be instrumental in driving a thorough GOP probe into how Big Tech and media colluded to suppress the Hunter Biden scandals if they win back a majority in the November midterm elections. Underscoring that material preservation was critical for Congress to be able to carry out a fact-finding inquiry into actions by technology companies, media and political allies \u201cto suppress information and prevent public awareness of matters involving the Biden Family,\" Darrell Issa added in a statement to Fox News: Darrell Issa was one of many Republicans who were outraged after The New York Times confirmed last week the authenticity of Hunter Biden's infamous laptop after dismissing the original article in the New York Post (NYP) almost a year and a half ago as \"Russian disinformation\". In 2020, the NYP alleged that the Mac belonging to Hunter Biden that he left at a repair shop in Delaware in 2019 contained several emails questioning claims by Joe Biden that he never used his former position as vice president to aid his son in the latter's foreign business dealings. At the time, then-US President Donald Trump dubbed the device \"the laptop from hell\". Back then, NYT claimed the New York Post story on the laptop was unsubstantiated, and social media companies had moved quickly to suspended The Post\u2019s accounts and blocked users from sharing the story, citing policies that prohibit distribution of hacked material. However, in its 16 March report about the ongoing federal probe into Hunter Biden's unpaid tax bills, the NYT said that when looking into the younger Biden's business dealings certain emails had been scrutinised by prosecutors. According to The New York Times, the emails in question were obtained by them from \"a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr Biden in a Delaware repair shop\". Furthermore, \"the email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation\". After this admission by NYT, Issa slammed the censorship related to the Hunter Biden story as amounting to a Watergate-level scandal. He tweeted on 17 March that he was calling for a Congressional investigation into how \u201cbig tech, mainstream media, and the Democrat industrial complex colluded to suppress the Hunter Biden scandals \u2014 and during the last days of the 2020 election.\u201d House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) also went on Twitter to say that Donald Trump, the republicans had been right. Last week Darrell Issa remarked that while he realised that Joe Biden would be \u201cfinishing out his term as corrupt as we now know he is\u201d, the \u201cbig crime\u201d was that the New York Post had come out with \u201ccredible evidence\u201d, but was shut down by the \u201cNew York Times\u201d, \u201cpublic broadcasting\u201d, and \u201cby having more than fifty of the most informed people in the intelligence world, all saying that they knew that this was false information.\u201d *Facebook is an extremist organisation banned in Russia.

This was done \u201cin order to prevent a threat to the life and health\u201d of these people so that they could safely return to their home countries, the minister explained.Last week, the Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki urged to stop issuing visas for Russian citizens as part of new sanctions against Russia.\u201cAnother suggestion is to freeze visas for all Russians,\u201d he said, explaining that, in his opinion, this was necessary to make Russians aware of what was happening in Ukraine. Belgium previously voiced a similar proposal.Japan earlier froze the issuance of visas to certain categories of Russians, while Lithuania, Latvia, Norway, and the Czech Republic have stopped issuing visas to all of the country's citizens.

They called on the US and the West to play a positive role in promoting peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, instead of transferring weapons to fan the flames. In a nine-minute interview with Margaret Brennan on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Monday, Qin was interrupted by Brennan more than 20 times with the latter continuing to ask whether China will support Russia over Ukraine, and why has China not condemned Russia. Despite Brennan's constant interruptions, Qin repeated that \"China has good relations with Russia, has good relations with Ukraine. And China keeps close communications with the US and with Europe. These enable China to reach out to all parties concerned in the crisis. So China's unique role can help with the peaceful settlement of the crisis.\"  Some criticized the CBS host for being \"rude\" to interrupt Qin from fully uttering his opinions. Analysts noted that such a scenario shows how eager the US is to pressure China into condemning Russia, but China has not and will not jump into the trap. Unlike China, which has made efforts to promote peace talks, the US - the initiator of the crisis - has done nothing positive to promote a ceasefire but fans the flames.It is true that the US is the obstacle of Russia-Ukraine negotiations. As the conflict continues and talks remain inconclusive, the situation will actually benefit the US, for it would be able to suppress Russia on one hand and strengthen its control over Europe on the other, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Monday.The interests of the US on the military conflict is different from that of Ukraine, although it seems that the US has been backing Ukraine by sending weapons, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times. \"In other words, preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is not the strategic aim of the US.\" Biden's plan for Europe is obvious, that he will urge Europe to unify its stance and align with the US on Russia, Cui Heng said, \"because now we see a division in the EU's stances on Russia, especially on the issue of oil and gas. Countries like Hungary, Poland, Germany and France that still have a need for Russia's oil and gas maintain a reserved attitude toward Russia, while the US and Canada already banned imports of Russian energy.\"Observers believe that having reached a point like this, the US' fanning flames will only do harm to the peaceful settlement between Russia and Ukraine. Instead, there should be a mediator, pushing forward relevant sides to approach each other's terms, and that role can only be played by China. \"For one thing, China has maintained good relations with both countries, and for another thing, China's independent foreign policy in the conflicts without siding with any party has allowed China to have a unique position,\" Cui Heng said. *This article was originally published by The Global Times.

Not even medical facilities are immune from the lunacy. Last week, the Iatros Clinic in Munich, Germany, announced it would no longer treat Russians and Belarusians, and I\u2019m guessing that unspeakable act of cruelty would have included pediatric patients too. Only after experiencing a wave of online criticism, proving that not everyone has lost their mind, did the facility retract its racist decision.Equally astonishing has been the West\u2019s brutal sanctions regime, which is so vicious and over the top that it could actually succeed in inflicting severe economic pain even on Westerners. This emotionally charged reaction to the events in Ukraine looks like virtue-signaling gone mad \u2013 a particularly worrisome development, given the mob seems incapable of differentiating between the actions of the Russian government and those of its citizens, who, as is the case with every country finding itself in such circumstances, have precious little say in matters related to war and peace.\u00a0And while it is perfectly natural to loathe war, and to speak out against it, a little consistency would be nice. Since I\u2019ve already explored the question of Western hypocrisy in a previous column, I\u2019ll just touch on it here: Why have the US and its NATO allies never suffered so much as a canceled dentist visit for their illicit military adventures across the Middle East and North Africa?And that brings us to another question: why has it become so acceptable, even fashionable, for people to embrace their inner Klansman whenever the subject is Russia, the global whipping boy? I believe I speak for the majority of Americans when I say we have been methodically conditioned from birth to believe Russians are inherently ruthless and amoral. Much of this conditioning occurs on the television screen and in the movie theater over the duration of a lifetime. Russians find the clich\u00e9s so ridiculous as to be amusing.\u00a0To offer just a couple of famous examples, in the 1985 film \u2018Rocky IV\u2019, Dolph Lundgren plays the part of Ivan Drago, the icy-cold, expressionless Soviet-Russian boxer who literally beats his opponent, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), to death in the ring without displaying an ounce of remorse. On a lighter but no less effective note, American children were entertained during the Cold War years by the TV series \u2018The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends,\u2019 in which the main antagonists are Russian spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale. Such examples of Russians playing the role of evil villains in Hollywood could be cited hundreds if not thousands of times.\u00a0These racist stereotypes have become so deeply ingrained in the Western brain that most people accept them at face value without thought \u2013 which, by the way, is practically the definition of \u2018brainwashed.\u2019 It\u2019s interesting to note that Americans \u2013 at least from what many Russians have told me \u2013 are rarely typecast as the villain in Russian films.In addition to being systematically vilified by Hollywood scriptwriters, Russia has been subjected for many years to a non-stop media smear campaign. From perpetuating the debunked news that the Kremlin played kingmaker by installing Donald Trump in the White House, to falsely accusing Russia of hacking the US power grid at the very peak of torrid AC season, it should come as no surprise that many Americans \u2013 aside from feeling nothing but media-generated contempt for Russians \u2013 have absolutely no clue what motivated Moscow to initiate its offensive actions in Ukraine in the first place.\u00a0A person does not have to agree with those motivations, of course, but they should at least be made aware of them. Instead of behaving in the interest of real journalism, however, Google\u2019s YouTube, for instance, banned all channels linked to Russian state media and even the supposedly unbiased search engine DuckDuckGo said it would deliberately down-rank Russian news sites.\u00a0Like so many others I am sickened by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the gigantic humanitarian crisis it continues to create. #StandWithUkraine\ufe0fAt DuckDuckGo, we've been rolling out search updates that down-rank sites associated with Russian disinformation.As far as the mendacious Western media is concerned, Russia woke up on February 24, yawned, stretched, and scratched itself, before deciding then and there that it was a wonderful day to shake up its neighbor. Such a myopic narrative precludes decades of Kremlin warnings, most notably Putin\u2019s now-famous speech at the 2007 Munich Security Conference, in which he told the packed assembly, \u201cNATO expansion \u2026 represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust. And we have the right to ask: against whom is this expansion intended?\u201dFar from legacy media and social media using the vast tools at their disposal to keep their readers informed, perhaps even demand some answers from NATO as to why it was so necessary to smash up against Russia\u2019s border, they contributed to political climate change at the worst possible time. Meta Platforms announced that, in the context of Moscow\u2019s military offensive in Ukraine, it would condone on Facebook and Instagram hate speech that called for violence against \u201cinvading Russians.\u201d As a thought experiment, would these US-based companies have made such dramatic concessions had American or NATO-ally lives been on the line? It seems doubtful.So, as Russians find themselves increasingly discriminated against in the West, another important question must be asked: Where was this level of hysteria when America and its allies was obliterating various Middle Eastern nations with its \u201cshock and awe\u201d performances that gave rise to a whole new genre of Merriam-Webster-approved euphemisms \u2013 gems such as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d(dead civilians), \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d (torture), and \u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d (state-sanctioned kidnappings to \u201cblack hole\u201d sites).Setting aside the tricky matter of whether a military response is ever the right response, should a people ever be judged on the actions of their leader? According to a recent poll by the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 70% of the Russian population supports the offensive in Ukraine. Yet military decisions in every country are typically made without the consent of the governed. Historically, the majority of onlookers are tolerant and intelligent enough to separate the actions of a government from those of its citizens. But somehow that sort of rational thinking got tossed out in the Ukrainian conflict, and that is turning into a tragedy not just for Russians, but for mankind."},{"uuid":"6ad77002-2bd9-4b6c-a8ce-6e743491a899","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552355-senio-russian-officer-killed\/?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=Email","title":"Deputy commander of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet killed in Ukraine","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623790c685f54014a7779e58.jpg","subtitle":"The senior officer got killed in combat near southeastern city of Mariupol, Russian officials have said","content":"Deputy commander of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, Captain 1st rank Andrey Paliy, was killed in combat near the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, multiple senior Russian officials said on Sunday.Yekaterina Altabaeva, Senator for the Crimean city of Sevastopol, the home port of the Black Sea Fleet, was first to break the news.

Switchblade killer drones are part of an additional $800 million military aid package announced by Washington on 16 March. Who is benefitting from the armament spree?","content":"\"One reason for the continued transfer of weapons from NATO nations to Ukraine is to keep the profits of the military industrial complex flowing\", says Bruce Gagnon, coordinator of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space and a contributor to Foreign Policy In Focus. \"The US will 'replace' these weapons to the particular donor country by either charging them for new military equipment or having the US taxpayers pay the bill. Either way, the weapons industry profits big time\". Western defence and cybersecurity stocks began to climb at the end of February as Washington and its NATO allies vowed to step up weapons supplies to Ukraine after the beginning of the Russian special operation, according to Gagnon.  The stocks made substantial progress in slightly over a week and are continuing to rally. Thus, between 24 February and 4 March, defence stocks broadly soared, with shares of Raytheon Technologies rising nearly 8%, General Dynamics 12%, Huntington Ingalls Industries 14%, Lockheed Martin 18%, and Northrop Grumman 22%, according to Fortune. Gagnon notes that Lockheed Martin currently tops the list, followed by other corporations like General Dynamics, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and BAE. However, even before the Russian operation, major US defence contractors started to benefit from Ukraine, with the Biden administration having increased lethal aid to the Eastern European country since the beginning of his presidency. \"In his first year in office, Biden approved more military aid to Ukraine \u2014 some $650 million \u2014 than the US had ever provided\", The Intercept remarked on 10 March. The US weapons supplies to Ukraine soared substantially in the second half of 2021 amid the Ukrainian military buildup along the contact line with the Donetsk and Lugansk Republics. On 9 March, the Russian Ministry of Defence released secret documents of the command of the National Guard of Ukraine, confirming preparation by Kiev authorities for an offensive operation in Donbass in March 2022. The US defence contractors are the major beneficiaries of US-NATO warmongering, according to Gagnon. Ukraine has long been in the focus of US politicians and the military industrial complex, according to the scholar. Gagnon cites a 2019 RAND Corporation study entitled \"Overextending and Unbalancing Russia\", co-authored by ex-State Department and White House adviser James Dobbins and military intelligence branched lieutenant colonel and Iraq War veteran, Raphael Cohen. \"Providing lethal aid to Ukraine would exploit Russia\u2019s greatest point of external vulnerability\", the study emphasised. According to The Intercept, the Obama administration provided a wide range of \"nonlethal military and intelligence assistance\" to Ukraine, including training, while under Donald Trump, \"Washington began a relatively modest flow of weapons shipments\". Under Biden, arms supplies to Ukraine have already become \"unprecedented\", according to the media outlet. Furthermore, the US political class and defence contractors have become intertwined through Washington's \"revolving door\" politics, notes Gagnon. \"The swinging door between the weapons industry and staff positions inside military and foreign policy institutions is strong evidence of this reality\", he says. \"There is no democracy in the US. WWII Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini defines fascism as 'the wedding of corporations and government'. This is exactly what we have in the US today - and throughout much of Europe as well\". Ironically, it is Joe Biden who declared an end to \"an era of major military operations to remake other countries\" following the US' hasty Afghanistan withdrawal, and stressed that the president\u2019s job is to protect and defend the \"fundamental national security interest of the United States of America\". According to Gagnon, Washington's Ukraine armament spree is caused by the US' unwillingness to completely lose its fading unipolar leadership. However, firm rejection of anti-Russian sanctions by nations throughout the Global South indicates that the West's efforts \"will not be successful\", says the scholar. The Wall Street Journal's recent report saying that Saudi Arabia is considering selling some oil to China using yuan instead of the \"petro-dollar\" shows the demise of the Western-centric world order, according to Gagnon. \"The West's arrogance, greed and sense of exceptionalism are their Achilles' heel\", the scholar concludes.

In his reply to the question, Jaishankar said that the Indian government was \u201cexamining various options\u201d to maintain existing commercial relations with Russia. The Indian foreign minister informed Parliament that a group comprising officials from different ministries was looking at various aspects of the trade ties between India and Russia, including the question of rupee trade. He also sadi that \u201cother countries import between 10 and 20 times the amount of oil that we do\u201d. The remarks by the chief Indian diplomat come just a couple of days after US President Joe Biden publicly called out India over its \u201cshaky response\u201d to the Ukraine crisis. While addressing a chief executive officer roundtable at the White House this week, Biden praised the \"united response\" which the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) allies and the US\u2019 partners in the Pacific region had made to Russia's special operation in Ukraine. \u201cThe Quad is - with the possible exception of India being somewhat shaky on some of this - but Japan has been extremely strong, so has Australia, in dealing with Putin\u2019s aggression. We presented a united front throughout NATO and the Pacific,\u201d Biden said. Last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki also urged New Delhi against supporting Russia as the western allies push to isolate it economically, politically and culturally in retaliation to Moscow\u2019s ongoing military operation in Ukraine. Psaki was answering a question about reports that India had decided to increase its crude purchases from Moscow, which has offered energy products and commodities to Delhi at a cheaper price. Psaki, however, admitted that sourcing more Russian oil by India won\u2019t violate the US sanctions. \"But also think about where you want to stand when history books are written about this moment in time,\u201d the US official added. Russian President, Vladimir Putin, launched a \"special military operation\" aimed at the \"demilitarisation\" and \"de-Nazification\" of Ukraine on 24 February.  Moscow has said that it would cease its military action if Kiev enshrines a \"neutral\" status in its constitution and pledges that it would never join NATO. After the Russia's operation began, a number of western states imposed sanctions against Moscow. Besides economic sanctions, the US and some eastern European allies such as Poland, urged the EU to ban the imports of Russian oil and other energy products.  The US, which used to source around 4 percent of its oil from Russia, announced a ban on Russian crude and other energy imports this month.   \u201cRussian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin\u2019s war machine,\u201d Biden announced this month.   However, Washington\u2019s insistence that EU allies completely cease their Russian imports has been met with little success in Europe, with nations such as Germany and Hungary warning that such a measure could have major economic implications and cause thousands of jobs to be lost.

The ministry slammed the remark as \"unacceptable\" and \"unworthy of a statesman of such high rank\", warning Washington that further unfriendly actions would receive a harsh and decisive response. Additionally, the Foreign Ministry said that the issue of Russian diplomatic missions' work in the US has been raised with the American ambassador.   Biden called Putin a \"war criminal\" on Wednesday during his conversation with reporters at the White House. When a journalist asked whether the US president considered his Russian counterpart to be a war criminal, Biden initially responded negatively, but then clarified: \"I think he is a war criminal\".   The remarks prompted a wave of scepticism even among those who largely shared Washington's official position on the ongoing Ukrainian crisis. After being reached out to for clarification on Biden's stance, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the US president \"was speaking from his heart and speaking from what he's seen on television\". The West, including the United States, has condemned Russia's military operation in Ukraine and imposed harsh sanctions on Moscow, demanding that the Kremlin immediately stop the operation. Russia, in its turn, has underlined that the goal of the operation is to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" Ukraine and said that its troops do not pose any threat to civilians, as only Ukrainian military infrastructure is being targeted. In early March, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that it was \"important\" for Washington to preserve diplomatic relations with Russia, even in the wake of the US calling on Americans to promptly leave Russia and refrain from trips there as the US government\u2019s opportunities to help them if necessary are limited.

According to Iohannis, countries cannot impose sanctions that will hit them much harder than Russia. Earlier this month, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that even discussing Europe's refusal of Russian oil is negative for the market, as it immediately reacts. Without Russian oil and gas the global economy will collapse, and prices will be unpredictable, according to Novak. This week, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia will be transferring payments for gas supplies to \"unfriendly countries\" into rubles, at the same time stressing that Russia would continue to supply gas in volumes and at prices fixed in earlier contracts, as the country values  its reputation. A series of Western countries have introduced new sanctions against Russia amid its operation in Ukraine. A number of companies have announced their withdrawal from the Russian market and the closure of production facilities in Russia. As the Kremlin said earlier in the month, the Western sanctions are very serious and Russia was preparing for them in advance. It requires analysis and coordination of agencies to work out the response measures corresponding with Russia's interests. Earlier in the month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the policy of restraining and weakening Russia is a long-term strategy of the West and sanctions have dealt a serious blow to the entire global economy. The main goal of the West is to worsen the lives of millions of people. The president also said that the US and the EU have defaulted on their obligations to Russia, freezing its foreign exchange reserves. Current events draw a line under the global dominance of the West in both politics and economics, the Russian leader said.

While making it clear that he does not foresee any such sanctions being imposed on India, Das did acknowledge that the action taken by the US has probably provoked every country to re-examine the composition of their forex reserves. Last month, Russia's military operation in Ukraine resulted in severe sanctions being imposed on the $1.7-trillion-economy, impacting transactions in most sectors except energy and pharma. The US and European Union, besides imposing sanctions on political leaders and businessmen, have frozen the Central Bank's assets stashed in different parts of the world. The West's decision has been dubbed an \"economic war\" by the Kremlin. It limits the Central Bank's ability to intervene in the currency market, where the ruble has recorded a drastic fall against the US dollar. On Monday, Shaktikanta Das assured industrialists and concerned people about India's well-distributed forex reserves in many currencies. \"We decided to diversify our reserves to other currencies not now but six months back. So I don't think this (sanctions) is a major problem for us\", Das underlined. On 17 March, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and ex-governor of the RBI said that fear of \"indiscriminate sanctions\" by the US could see China, India, and others limiting their holdings in the advanced economy.

Negotiations began but have been difficult because the Ukrainian side, although it seems to have expressed understanding of the things  that should be agreed during talks, is constantly changing its position, rejecting its own proposals,\" Lavrov said in a speech it MGIMO, Russia's top diplomatic school, on Wednesday. Moscow, Lavrov said, requires \"reinforced concrete\" agreements with Kiev in the future so that no forces are ever tempted to violate them. The minister also said Russia was not against Western countries' eagerness to play some kind of mediating role in the current crisis. \"But we have absolutely clear red lines, which we have been talking about for many years,\" he said. Lavrov suggested that current Western moves, such as the provision of advanced anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine, will surely have a blowback effect, among them deliveries of \"additional Stingers, which are a colossal threat, because they will undoubtedly spread all over Europe.\" The foreign minister also commented on the prospects of a NATO \"peacekeeping force\" in Ukraine, warning that such a move would lead to direct clashes with Russian forces. Lavrov also brought up the topic of US-financed biological laboratories in the former USSR, saying the Pentagon's interest in Soviet-era biolabs in Kazakhstan \"requires clarification.\" \"We are now completing the preparation of a memorandum of cooperation in the field of biology with our Kazakh friends...I hope that we will resolve these issues with Kazakhstan,\" he said. Commenting on Western countries' move to seize over $300 billion in assets from Russia's reserve cushion, which wound up in Western countries for reasons as yet unclear, Lavrov characterised the freeze as plain \"theft\".  \"When the central bank's reserves were frozen, no one among those who predicted what sanctions the West might apply could even think of this. It's just theft,\" Lavrov said. In the future, Lavrov said, Russia must not depend on the West as it has in the past, but be ready to cooperate on equal terms. \"[We need] clarity which will be based on the absence of any dependence on the West in the future. If they want to cooperate, of course we will not step back from this, if it is based on an equal footing, in both our interests, if there is a balance of interests.\" Russia, the minister suggested, has sufficient material resources and talented people to be self-sufficient. \"We have a huge country, resources, brains, everything we need to be self-sufficient, but at the same time open up to the outside world for mutually beneficial projects.\" "},{"uuid":"719e46e7-17ce-4463-8d2f-664dd32dc8af","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552810-us-denies-russia-regime-change-strategy\/","title":"Blinken denies regime-change strategy against Russia","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6240b23285f5407fee23d587.jpg","subtitle":"US secretary of state tries to walk back Joe Biden\u2019s comment that Vladimir Putin \u2018cannot remain in power\u2019","content":"America\u2019s leading diplomat has insisted President Joe Biden didn\u2019t mean to suggest Washington aims to oust Vladimir Putin as Russia\u2019s leader, standing by previous assertions that the US doesn\u2019t have a regime-strange strategy in Moscow.US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken made his comments at a press conference on Sunday in Jerusalem, hours after Biden raised eyebrows during an emotional speech in Warsaw about Russia\u2019s military operation in Ukraine. Biden said of President Putin, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, this man cannot remain in power.\u201dAn unidentified White House official quickly tried to clarify the US position, saying Biden\u2019s point was that Putin can\u2019t be allowed to exercise power over neighboring countries.

German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

The MoD has published correspondence between the US President\u2019s son and employees of the US Department of Defense Threat Reduction Office, as well as Pentagon contractors in Ukraine. The emails suggest that Hunter Biden was instrumental in raising funds for the American contractors, Black &amp; Veatch and Metabiota, enabling the companies to engage in pathogen studies on the territory of Ukraine, stated the head of the Russian radiation, chemical and biological defense forces, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov. It also follows from the correspondence that the goals of the Pentagon in Ukraine are far from scientific, underscored the Russian Defense Ministry. Igor Kirillov recalled that earlier, in the course of Russia\u2019s special operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine, the military had seized documents that revealed an ongoing scheme of interaction between US government agencies, the current military-political leadership of the United States with Ukrainian biolabs. In particular, the documentary evidence pointed to the involvement of an investment fund managed by Hunter Biden in financing high-risk biological research in Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry has also presented the names of US officials involved in the creation of bioweapons components in Ukraine. One of these was Robert Pope, at the time Director of the US Defense Department's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at DTRA, which had sought to draw post-Soviet states into biological warfare, stated Major General Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, at Thursday's briefing. Pope spearheaded the idea of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bcreating a \"Central Depository of Especially Dangerous Microorganisms in Kiev,\" the general added. Joanna Wintrall, the head of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) office at the US embassy in Kiev, led the coordination of military biological projects in Ukraine, Konashenkov said. Furthermore, Lance Lippencott, Program Director at the Ukrainian division of the company Black &amp; Veatch, acted as the main contact for officials of Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defense and Health Ministry, said Konashenkov. According to him, Black &amp; Veatch has been working in the interests of the Pentagon since 2008 as an inherent part of projects studying potentially dangerous bioagents. Among these was the UP-1 project to study rickettsia and tick-borne encephalitis virus in arthropods in northwestern Ukraine. In the course of the UP-2 project, the company introduced a system for remote monitoring of the incidence of tularemia and anthrax at Ukrainian biological facilities, said the Russian general, adding: The MoD then revealed that Ukrainian engine maker Motor Sich asked the manufacturers of Turkish Bayraktar drones about the possibility of using the UAVs to spray deadly substances, which raises concerns in the light of the American military biological programme developed in Ukraine. Igor Kirillov stressed that the document on this request is dated 15 December 2021, with Motor Sich wondering if it's possible to equip Bayraktar drones with systems and mechanisms for spraying aerosols with a capacity of more than 20 liters. He emphasised that such a UAV with a flight range of 300 kilometers could pose a real threat of contamination of the territory of Russia. Russia's MoD has previously shed light on the fact that the US spent more than $200 million on the work of biological laboratories in Ukraine, which were a part of the American military biological programme and dealt, in particular, with plague and anthrax pathogens. The freshly-provided damning correspondence comes as the Russian military has spent weeks shedding light on research into deadly pathogens being conducted in Ukrainian laboratories under the direction of the Pentagon and with US funding. Initially, the MoD's reporting was dismissed by Washington as \"Russian disinformation\", with both officials and media since then corroborating many of the assertions. According to Konashenkov, the Russian militarywould be continuing its analysis of documents received from employees of Ukraine-based biological laboratories, including the secret military biological activities being conducted in the country by the US.

The newspaper recalled that it was previously announced that Zelensky would speak before the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Italian Parliament, via a video link next Tuesday, amid Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. Lawmaker Nicola Grimaldi told La Repubblica that he would like to \"invite\" Putin to address the Italian Parliament via a video call after Zelensky's speech, something that was also welcomed by Grimaldi's colleagues Davide Serritella and Gabriele Lorenzoni. As for Grimaldi, he, along with four other colleagues from the 5 Star Movement and the League coalition, recently voted against a bill stipulating that Italy send \"non-lethal\" military help to Ukraine in a show of support for Kiev against Moscow. The developments come as Russia continues its special military operation in Ukraine, which was announced by President Putin on 24 February and aims to demilitarise and de-Nazify the country. The operation was launched after a request for help from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) amid continuing shelling of their positions and infrastructure by the Ukrainian Army. The operation is only targeting Ukraine's military infrastructure with high-precision weapons, posing no threat to the civilian population, according to the Russian Defence Ministry. Moscow and Kiev are currently in talks to resolve the conflict, with Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky on Friday stressing that the sides have made progress on several issues during the negotiations, including Ukraine's neutral status and its non-entry to NATO. He added that \"the nuances are related to what security guarantees Ukraine can receive in addition to existing ones, in case of its refusal to join NATO\". The statement came after Putin said earlier this week that the special operation is going as planned and that the tactics mapped out by the Russian Defence Ministry and the General Staff had justified themselves.

There, Baden-Wurttemberg Minister of Agriculture and Consumer Protection Peter Hauk told citizens to get used to wearing sweaters to deal with the cold after he backed a complete ban on Russian oil and gas imports.Rising fuel prices have rocked Macron\u2019s entire presidency, with a tax hike in 2018 triggering years of near-weekly \u2018Yellow Vest\u2019 protests that grew into a show of dissatisfaction with his neoliberal economic policies. Despite persistently low approval ratings and the current spike in living costs, however, Macron is projected to win the first round of elections next month.If successful, he would likely face off against right-wing stalwart Marine Le Pen, a showdown that polls show him winning, albeit less comfortably than he did in 2017."},{"uuid":"7280d9f0-c10d-42f0-8b47-276b190c2fb8","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552846-novaya-gazeta-newspaper-suspended\/","title":"Russian liberal newspaper suspends publication \u2018until Ukraine operation ends\u2019","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6241d5ff20302725ef6d262e.jpg","subtitle":"Novaya Gazeta has decided to \u201ctemporarily\u201d halt its operations after receiving two warnings in a row from the media regulator","content":"The Moscow-based Novaya Gazeta newspaper has announced it will suspend its operations from Monday, after receiving the second notice in a row from the Russian media watchdog.\u201cWe received another warning from Roskomnadzor.

Even if they apologize later, even if they take me back into the Candidates Tournament, I\u2019ll create my own organization\u2026\u201cWe\u2019ll create a good, professional team, we will work with permanent sponsors. All the good things that FIDE does, I\u2019m talking about the World Championship, about holding tournaments, we\u2019ll transfer all this to our organization with a large prize fund.\u201cWe\u2019ll wait for anyone who wants [to join]. I\u2019ve been nurturing this idea since yesterday, I\u2019ve already discussed it with some people, I\u2019ve already enlisted some kind of support.\u201cPlus, ordinary people, and this is very important to me, they ask me, they say: \u2018Let\u2019s do it, we will support it.\u2019\u201cSo that not everything can be decided only by an order from above. It\u2019s very important for me that ordinary people support me.\u201dKarjakin has received support from the Chess Federation of Russia in the aftermath of his ban, with the organization vowing to appeal the suspension. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also urged FIDE to reconsider the ban, describing it as \u201cpolitical.\u201dBorn in Simferopol, Karjakin switched allegiances from Ukraine to Russia in 2009.He is a former world rapid and blitz chess champion, and pushed Carlsen all the way in their epic world championship meeting in New York in 2016 before falling in a tiebreak series.A vocal supporter of President Putin, Karjakin issued an open letter to the Russian leader at the onset of the military operation in Ukraine, wishing the armed forces success.\u201cIt is fighting for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine with its ruling regime, which has put the security of all of Europe and our country at risk, for the sake of its political goals and ambitions,\u201d wrote Karjakin.\u201cI am closely following the ongoing special operation, in the lands where I spent my childhood, where I learned to play chess and where my relatives still live.\u201cFor eight long years we have been waiting with hope for salvation from countless shelling and loss of human lives, the ongoing genocide by the still acting Kiev regime.\u201cI express to you, our commander-in-chief, full support in protecting the interests of Russia, our multinational Russian people, eliminating threats and establishment of peace! I wish you the speedy fulfilment of all the tasks assigned to our valiant army.\u201dKarjakin said he and his family had received death threats in light of his stance, although he also said he had been given messages of support.FIDE announced on March 16 that it was banning Russia and Belarus from its team tournaments until further notice, but said players from the two countries would be able to compete as individuals under neutral status and the FIDE flag. \u00a0"},{"uuid":"734bfd56-4d01-4f4f-9ea0-6425a5f010aa","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/sport\/553023-anna-shcherbakova-decision-figure-skating-career\/","title":"Olympic queen Shcherbakova makes career decision","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6245697f85f5400f214a8367.jpg","subtitle":"Anna Shcherbakova spoke about her aims after rumors she could call time on her career","content":"Russian figure skating star Anna Shcherbakova has declared that she \u201cstill has the same goals\u201d in an indication that the 18-year-old Olympic champion will not retire from competitive action.Rumors have swirled in recent days that Shcherbakova could retire after she signaled that the bans imposed on Russian skaters because of the Ukraine conflict might be a factor in her decision.But speaking on Russia\u2019s Channel 1 on Thursday, Beijing gold medalist Shcherbakova suggested any retirement talk was premature. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll continue to skate, I still have the same goals.

Before playing the clip, however, Cooper felt obliged to do a bit of explaining for viewers just in case they should get the wrong (sic) idea. He said the Ukrainian soldiers who are heard repeatedly shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d were actually Chechen volunteers who had signed up to fight against Russia. So our kindly CNN host is trying to contrive an apologetic distinction here. Shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d is \u201cOK\u201d if you are from Chechnya, he implies, as opposed to Saudi Arabia or some other place more associated with Islamic terrorists in Western public perception. Forbid the subversive thought that there may be no distinction. The Islamist slogan is a well-known rallying cry used by Jihadist terror groups affiliated with Al Qaeda* outfits like Nusra Front* and Daesh* who recruit fighters from all over the world. During the Syrian war, these militants would often release propaganda videos depicting fighters firing off weapons and shouting the slogan. Chechnya in Russia\u2019s southern Caucasus region is a stronghold of Islamist terror groups that Moscow battled against during the late 1990s and 2000s. The same militants were responsible for terrorist atrocities against civilians in the Russian capital such as the theater hostage in 2002 when 171 people were killed. The similarity with the Mariupol theater incident in Ukraine last week is notable. Chechen fighters were an important fighting element in the Western-backed war for regime change in Syria. Western media like CNN covered up the links between the US and NATO governments and the terror groups who were doing their bidding to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad. That covert war failed because of Russia\u2019s military intervention in support of the Syrian nation from the end of 2015 onwards. Getting back to CNN\u2019s video clip this week from Ukraine, what the American cable news channel is doing is inadvertently admitting that Chechen Jihadists are fighting in support of the Kiev regime. Secondly, it shows too that the Western media and governments are in effect back to their unspoken Syrian war policy of supporting the Jihadists \u2013 albeit lionizing them as \u201cfighters against Russia\u201d in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a military intervention in Ukraine on 24 February because the Kiev regime was attacking Russian-speaking populations for eight years. The United States and its NATO partners weaponized Ukraine deliberately to threaten Russia\u2019s security. NATO special forces from the US, Britain and Canada held training camps in Ukraine for Nazi fighters. This is consistent with how the US and its allies covertly backed the Third Reich\u2019s Nazi remnants in the Gehlen Organization after the Second World War in Soviet territories. Moscow says that its war in Ukraine will continue until the country is neutralized as a military threat. That means no NATO membership or presence and the elimination of Nazi paramilitaries that form the backbone of the Kiev regime since the CIA-orchestrated coup in 2014. In other words, the present war could have been averted if Washington and its NATO allies had refrained from their systematic hostile policy towards Russia. If Russia\u2019s proposals for a security treaty had been respected and negotiated reasonably the present crisis would have been avoided. Ever since the 2014 CIA-backed coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Kiev when an elected Ukrainian president was violently overthrown, the Western media like CNN have systematically ignored the reality of the Nazi paramilitaries underpinning the regime. The Azov Battalion and their ilk are now presented as some kind of noble resistance movement against \u201cRussian aggression\u201d. Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian comedian-turned-president, is flagged up by Western media for his Jewish ancestry as somehow a countervailing narrative, instead of the possibility that he is simply a puppet for the CIA and its Nazi militants who actually run the country. Ironically, US President Joe Biden has lately been lecturing China, India and others to be \u201con the right side of history\u201d by joining the Western campaign to condemn Russia over the conflict in Ukraine. It is grotesque for an American president to label others as war criminals when we look at how the Americans wage criminal war after criminal war, flattening cities like Fallujah, Mosul and Raqqa to prosecute their illicit objectives. It\u2019s also grotesque for American and European governments and their media to pontificate about the \u201cright side of history\u201d when they are openly supporting Nazis and now we can see Jihadist terrorists in Ukraine \u2013 just like they did covertly during their regime-change war in Syria. The astounding Western duplicity and hypocrisy are only possible when the propaganda machine that is Western media is allowed to run its \u201cprograms\u201d full throttle without any intelligent media challenge. That\u2019s why the US and European Union are doing everything to censor and shut down Russian news media. It is incredible but nevertheless illuminating that today, the Western public is prevented from accessing RT and Sputnik news websites via open sources of the internet. The draconian censorship is necessitated because the shocking truth is the Western governments and their media are on the ugly side of history from weaponizing and glorifying Nazis and head-chopping terrorists in Ukraine. *Daesh (IS\/ISIS\/ISIL), Al-Qaeda, Nusra Front are terrorist organisations banned in Russia.

The Georgian leadership has abstained from imposing anti-Russian sanctions, arguing that such a step would only harm the country\u2019s own economy.\u201cGeorgia is behaving not very appropriately, to put it mildly,\u201d the official said, calling on the Salome Zourabichvili government to try and \u201creturn\u201d\u00a0territories. Danilov was apparently referring to South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which broke away from Tbilisi in the 1990s and are recognized as independent by Russia.\u201cBut, what if both Pridnestrovie [another name for Transnistria, an enclave internationally recognised as part of Moldova], and Georgia, and everyone would embark onto returning their territories today,\u201d Danilov asked. A Russian peacekeeping force has been stationed for decades in Transnistria.\u00a0\u201cThis would definitely help us, because that would make them busy with something besides destroying our cities and villages, killing our children and women.\u201dDanilov\u2019s warlike calls, however, have met a cold reception in Georgia, with multiple politicians firmly rejecting such ideas. An MP from the ruling Georgian Dream party and the head of Georgia\u2019s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, Nikoloz Samharadze, even expressed doubts such statements could have been produced by that senior official at all.\u201cI hope this is a lie. Does the Secretary of the Security Council of Ukraine call on Georgia and others to abandon the policy of peaceful restoration of their territorial integrity, opening a second front to destroy our cities and villages, so that Georgian women and children die too?

The general claimed that the formerly German region, which ended up under Russian rule after the defeat of the Nazis in World War Two, was, in fact, Polish land.The remarks prompted\u00a0widespread condemnation in Russia, with the governor of the region, Anton Alikhanov, warning the Polish general that his country should not raise territorial claims, given that \u201ca very large part of land that is now Poland, in fact, was conquered, claimed from Nazi Germany and transferred as a gift from the Soviet to the Polish people [by\u00a0Joseph Stalin's regime].\u201d"},{"uuid":"7356212c-2ce9-4319-99d3-eef1c95b586a","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220321\/american-delusions-of-pitting-china-against-russia-1094061665.html","title":"American Delusions of Pitting China against Russia","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e5\/02\/07\/1082008929_0:0:3000:2000_1440x900_80_0_1_f2fa7850f9c980e1c16d8ccb16d3fbee.jpg?source-sid=ap_photo","subtitle":"Nice try Joe.

It\u2019s a sign of the times of declining US global power that China effectively told the American side to wind their necks in. \u201cChina will not be coerced by anyone,\u201d said its foreign minister Wang Yi commenting on the earlier video call between the two leaders. The American political class is so out of tune with reality. It seems to still think that whatever they say is a writ for the rest of the world to obey. But the rest of the world is learning to ignore the US duplicity and blatant attempt to dominate through diktat. President Vladimir Putin and President Xi unveiled a strategic partnership last month that precisely rejects US hegemonic ambitions and Cold War geopolitics of divide and conquer. Russia and China are calling for a multipolar international order based on mutual partnership and respect. Such a vision is intolerable for US-led Western capitalism. Beijing understands that the ongoing conflict in Ukraine is a direct result of American and NATO hostility towards Russia. Years of aggression and destabilization through supporting Neo-Nazi paramilitaries like the Azov Battalion have blown up into the present violence. For Biden to arrogantly demand Xi to join Western economic warfare against Russia is American hubris taken to sublime levels. Washington has succeeded in getting its European vassals to shoot themselves in the foot by thwarting energy trade with Russia. Now, the Americans want China to do the same. China\u2019s global economic power is driven by a vast supply of Russian gas and oil. The Americans want to sabotage China\u2019s ascent as an economic power to offset their own historic demise as a bankrupt capitalist has-been, and for that Washington is demanding Beijing to forfeit its relations with Moscow. You could hardly make this American conceit up. China can see through the nauseating hypocrisy of Biden and others in Washington. The American posturing and pontificating towards Russia about alleged violations of international law in Ukraine are sickeningly absurd given the litany of criminal wars and destruction from the US and its NATO gangsters. Biden himself is personally responsible for facilitating criminal wars in dozens of countries during his decades-long political career in Washington. But it\u2019s not just about hypocrisy. The fact is the Americans and their unipolar hegemonic mindset and ambitions of dominance have led to the crisis in Ukraine. China understands that the only way to avoid conflict is for a mutual security treaty to be established for Europe, one that involves mutual negotiations with Russia. But such negotiations and security treaty are anathema to the Cold War logic of Washington and its NATO partners. Russia tried to negotiate through diplomatic proposals but was continually rebuffed by the US and NATO. Another crucial aspect of America\u2019s delusions about pitting China against Russia is that Beijing knows full well that the very same nefarious game is being played by Washington with regard to Taiwan. The Americans are brazenly weaponizing the island territory to undermine China\u2019s national security and strategic balance. Even though Washington officially recognizes Taiwan as an integral part of China under Beijing\u2019s sovereignty, the Americans are doing everything to inflame tensions between the mainland and the island. The US under Biden is weaponizing Taiwan with the apparent objective of inciting conflict with China. This is analogous to what Washington and its NATO allies have done to Ukraine. When Biden tried to lecture Xi last week about China being expected to not support Russia what the American was trying to do was pressure Beijing with moral blackmail to join US-led efforts to subjugate Russia. The Americans are so full of their own self-righteous arrogance and propaganda they don\u2019t even realize when they look stupid. President Xi reportedly gave Biden a brush-off and reminded him of China\u2019s priority concern over America\u2019s nefarious machinations on Taiwan. China supports Russia as a matter of international principle and shared vision of a more viable global order based not on American hegemony, but rather on mutual respect. China also knows that if Washington were to ever succeed in somehow subjugating Russia to its diktat, the US would move quickly to target China for its next act of imperialist bullying. Joe Biden is the personification of US presumed global power: frail and oblivious to its own demise in a changing world. Ordering China around is like a drunk in the Last Chance Saloon ordering another round he can no longer pay for.

According to Statistics Canada data, in 2021 alone Canada imported CAD$4.8 million ($3.78 million) worth of alcoholic beverages from Russia. The campaign against Russian products comes as a response to a special operation in Ukraine, launched by Moscow in February.

Medvedev wrote in a Telegram post that Washington has tried to \"humiliate, limit, divide and destroy\" Russia. According to Dmitry Medvedev, Washington has made it its mission to destroy Russia and then China, which would lead to a global crisis and collapse; however, Moscow will never allow such a turn of events. He stated that over the past 30 years, Russia has been the target of a mediocre and primitive game waged by the United States. \"There is only one explanation - it is an enemy. What other successors of the USSR are there, even if there are no more fundamental ideological contradictions? This means that Russia must be humiliated, limited, divided and destroyed,\" underscored Medvedev. The next goal of Washington, Medvedev continued, will be the total weakening of China. Medvedev added that the Russian Federation would like to see the United States as a responsible state that performs all the functions of a great power, a state that tries to solve its many internal problems, and does not undermine the development of other countries. \"All this is possible. Unless, of course, you think that the US president's name is Volodymyr Zelensky and do not periodically ask aides how to spell Iraq or Iran correctly,\" he concluded. Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine on 24 February to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" the country after a direct request for assistance from the Donbass republics, which faced weeks of escalated shelling, sabotage and sniper attacks by the Ukrainian military. The Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics had earlier been formally recognised as independent states by Russia on 21 February.  In response, Washington and dozens of European nations have imposed several batches of sanctions against Russia, targeting its economy, space industry, financial institutions, businesses, etc. over what they called \"an invasion.\" Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the goal of the current operation was to neutralise Ukraine's military capacity while not harming the civilian population of the country. In March, the Russian Ministry of Defence began presenting evidence of suspected Ukrainian plans to launch a full-scale offensive in the Donbass, and reporting on the presence of a network of Pentagon-funded biological laboratories in the country, the existence of which US officials and media first denied but later confirmed.

Therefore, I welcome that we will now use our collective bargaining power. Instead of outbidding each other, driving prices up, we will pool our demand.\u201dVon der Leyen has already promised to reduce Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian gas, but some EU countries remain dependent on a steady supply from Russia. Germany, whose leaders have recently warned that their economy could crash were Russian imports sanctioned, relies on Moscow for more than half of its gas supply.However, leaders in Berlin have balked at paying for Russian gas in rubles, as Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded they do earlier this week. France too has opposed the gas-for-rubles system, with French President Emmanuel Macron telling reporters on Friday that he believes such a demand is \u201cforbidden\u201d by law.Should the EU refuse to pay in rubles, as it likely will, its members will have to source their gas elsewhere. The US will likely step in to fill that void. In a joint news conference with US President Joe Biden on Friday, von der Leyen said that Washington would step up its deliveries of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to \u201cat least 50 billion cubic meters\u201d per year, which she said would replace a third of the gas currently provided by Russia.\"We as Europeans want to diversify away from Russia towards suppliers that we trust, that are our friends, that are reliable,\" she said.\u00a0However, American LNG is more expensive than the Russian alternative, and getting it to Europe involves condensing it to fill special tanker ships, before converting it back to gas upon arrival at a purpose-built port facility. There are currently two dozen LNG import terminals in Europe, but none in Germany, which is an important gas distribution location. At present, work has yet to begin on Germany\u2019s flagship LNG terminal, which is set to start receiving gas in 2024.These issues with pricing and logistics led Germany to ignore American offers of LNG shipments under President Donald Trump, and press ahead with the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia instead. However, Nord Stream 2\u2019s certification was halted in response to the conflict in Ukraine.\u00a0\"I know eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe,\u201d Biden said during his appearance with von der Leyen, before adding that high energy prices are something that Europe should put up with to oppose Putin.\u201cIt\u2019s not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's gonna put us on a much stronger strategic footing.\u201d"},{"uuid":"767a2fc2-6f74-4711-b525-f8f9e3df4f75","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552988-russia-ukraine-weapons-synagogue\/","title":"Ukraine used synagogue to store weapons \u2013 Russia","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/62445e4620302748393a39fc.png","subtitle":"The Russian Defense Ministry has accused Kiev of spreading \u201ccynical lies\u201d about its military campaign","content":"Russia claimed on Wednesday that Ukrainian fighters have been using a synagogue to secretly store weapons and ammunition.

Tens of thousands of Jews gather in Uman to pay their respects at the tomb of a local religious leader.The images, according to Konashenkov, were dated March 21 and provided by \u201ca member of Uman\u2019s Jewish community.\u201d They appear to be stills from a CCTV video and show a group of men in fatigues gathering around a truck and two buses parked outside a building, which Konashenkov identified as a synagogue.The truck is loaded with backpacks and objects similar to rolled up cushion foams.

However, according to IBA consultancy, most of the planes are still flying on Russia\u2019s domestic routes.Dual registration of planes is forbidden under international rules but, in an unprecedented move so as not to lose the airfleet, Russia passed a law allowing it to move foreign-owned aircraft to its domestic registry earlier this week. Over 800 planes out of a total of 1,367 have already been registered, and they will be getting airworthiness certificates within Russia.According to the country\u2019s authorities, the aircraft will stay and operate in Russia until the current lease contracts run out. The government will also be moving to buy these aircraft, worth an estimated total of $20 billion. The head of Russia\u2019s Transport Ministry Vitaly Savelyev said this week that airlines are trying to negotiate with lessors to buy the planes, but \u201cso far to no avail.\u201d Meanwhile, 78 planes leased to Russian carriers were seized due to sanctions abroad, and will most likely be returned to lessors.However, the situation still leaves leasing firms hostage in the political battle. According to analysts, they face years of negotiations with insurers because of the unprecedented nature and scale of losses. Lessors could use security deposits or letters of credit from Russian banks to cover the losses, but the former are worth only a fraction of the planes\u2019 value, while the latter are mostly in US dollars and effectively have no value because of Russian sanction-response currency controls. However, though the total value of the planes is large, the impact on individual leasing firms may not be too great, experts say, as Russian airlines mostly account for less than 10% of leasing firm portfolios.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to cripple these businesses,\u201d Brad Dailey, a director at Alton Aviation Consultancy, told Reuters, noting, however, that the situation \u201cchanges the future market potential of Russia.\u201dFor more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"},{"uuid":"7683c1fd-4b63-41c7-8259-91896827dddd","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552249-kremlin-reacts-biden-insults-putin\/","title":"Kremlin reacts to Biden\u2019s Putin insults","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6234a4af203027635e69f84e.jpg","subtitle":"The Russian president\u2019s spokesman says the US leader\u2019s remarks were probably due to fatigue","content":"The Kremlin sees recent aggressive statements made by US President Joe Biden about his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin as \u201ca personal insult\u201d caused by Biden\u2019s fatigue and irritability.

Kiev has been pleading for foreign aid to help it fight off the Russian military offensive.\u201cIt is the responsibility of the West and especially the US to normalize relations with Turkey,\u201d Altun wrote in a letter to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on Wednesday. He added that \u201cwhat the West must do is deliver the F-35 fighter jets and Patriot batteries to Turkey without preconditions.\u201dThe spokesman wrote that Washington\u2019s removal of Turkey from the F-35 program in 2019 was \u201cunlawful.\u201d The US refused to deliver the promised planes after Ankara rejected its demand to scrap the purchase of S-400s.Altun was responding to a Wall Street Journal op-ed from last week, which asked Ankara to give its S-400s to Kiev so they can use them to shoot down Russian aircraft. Paul Kolbe, a scholar at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and former CIA operative, wrote that Turkey could get the now-dead F-35 shipment from the US \u201cback on track,\u201d as well Patriot batteries as a \u201cnice new American replacement\u201d for the S-400s. Kolbe further argued it would be \u201csymbolic\u201d for Russian-made missiles to destroy Russian planes.Reuters reported on Monday that US officials informally pitched the idea of the transfer of the Russian-made missile systems to Ukraine during Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman\u2019s trip to Turkey this month. Ankara and Washington have not commented on the matter.Turkey was in talks with the US to buy the Patriot systems before it acquired the S-400s, but the deal fell apart. Altun noted that, in 2015, Washington withdrew the missiles from the Turkish-Syrian border. Ankara\u2019s relations with Moscow plummeted that year after a Turkish fighter jet shot down a Russian warplane during its mission in Syria.Turks still remember how our allies withdrew Patriot batteries from Turkey during some of the tensest periods in Turkish-Russian relations. In light of experience, the Turkish people no longer take seriously any informal pledge by the West to supply the Patriot.Altun pointed to Ukraine\u2019s use of Turkish Bayraktar combat drones as part of a successful arms deal with the country. Kiev has been asking NATO to set up a no-fly zone over Ukraine or to supply it with warplanes in order to fend off Russian jets, but these requests have been denied.Moscow attacked Ukraine exactly one month ago, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

German energy giant E.ON, which operates the pipeline, has rejected the calls.TheGerman CEO has called for increasing investments in renewable energy sources and to \u201cexpand their use as quickly as possible.\u201d Sewing also said that a technology-intensive nation such as Germany shouldn\u2019t rule out nuclear energy in such a decisive way.Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank said it would shut down its business in Russia due to Moscow\u2019s offensive in Ukraine.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"},{"uuid":"7747cb02-1f6d-429a-b5b4-8227fcb554a3","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552328-mercenary-base-strike-ukraine\/","title":"Russia says it\u2019s struck another mercenary base in Ukraine","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/62370c6985f540570c0cacf7.jpg","subtitle":"More than 100 Ukrainian special ops troops and foreign soldiers of fortune were eliminated, according to Moscow","content":"Russian forces hit a Ukrainian special forces training center early on Sunday, killing more than 100 local troops and foreign mercenaries, the Ministry of Defense has said.A Ukrainian Special Operations Forces training center near the town of Ovruch in the northern Zhytomyr Region, which hosted the mercenaries, was targeted by \u201chigh-precision air-launched missiles,\u201d ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said during a briefing.The airstrike has eliminated more than 100 Ukrainian special ops troops and foreign soldiers of fortune, he added.A week ago, Russia destroyed another mercenary base at the Yavoriv range in the western Lviv region, saying that up to 180 foreign fighters were killed there.Kiev disputed those numbers and put the death toll at 35 people.

The emails revealed the names of several American figures central to the biological research projects from the firms Metabiota and Black &amp; Veatch, as well as officials from the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Those named include: Pope was deputy director of operations, readiness and exercises at the DTRA from 2017 until 2020. He previously held various positions at US Air Force European Command (USAFE), US Central Command (USCC), and the Pentagon. Pope participated in the development of radiochemical procedures for monitoring international treaties in the field of nuclear weapons (Air Force Technical Application Center). The published emails revealed a correspondence between Pope and Ukraine\u2019s acting health minister between 2016 and 2019, American-born Ulana Suprun, who went to Ukraine to participate in the US-backed coup in 2014. Williams took over for Pope as acting DTRA director in 2020, having previously been the agency\u2019s director of development, test and evaluation. He led the Department of Defense\u2019s program to develop capabilities to detect, locate and neutralize foreign WMD and improvised explosive devices. Williams also served as Assistant Deputy Administrator for Nonproliferation at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the US Department of Energy, the organization responsible for the country\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal. Wintrol headed DTRA projects in Ukraine until 2021 at the US Embassy in Kiev\u2019s Defense Threat Reduction Office. Emails published by the MoD revealed she directly supervised experiments with deadly pathogens, including the UP-2 Project for \u201cmapping highly infectious diseases in Ukraine,\u201d including anthrax; the UP-4 Project, described as a \u201crisk assessment of particularly dangerous pathogens transmitted by birds in Ukraine during migration\u201d; the UP-8 Project studying \u201cspread of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and hantaviruses in Ukraine and the potential need for differential diagnosis of patients with suspected leptospirosis. Previously released documents showed she also oversaw Project P-782, conducting research into the transmission of diseases through bats. Wintrol moved to Chemical Security and Elimination (CSE) in early 2021. According to a DTRA publication, CSE was formerly known as the Chemical Weapons Elimination (CWE) program and the Chemical Weapons Destruction (CWD) program. The effort \u201cstarted in 1992 to build the capacity of the states of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) to reduce the threat from chemical weapons (CW) by securing and eliminating CW stockpiles, chemical research capabilities, and production facilities, while also redirecting scientists to peaceful purposes,\u201d the agency said. Since 2013, Edwards has been the CEO of American engineering firm Black &amp; Veatch, a longtime contractor for the Pentagon used for a variety of construction tasks. He has been with the company since 1978 and was formerly its Chief Operating Officer. Black &amp; Veatch was long known to be working on Pentagon projects in Ukraine, but the documents seized by Russian forces earlier this month revealed the firm\u2019s job in overseeing biological programs there, including the UP-8 project previously mentioned, studying Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, leptospirosis and hantaviruses. He has been the project manager in Ukraine for Black &amp; Veatch since 2011 and its biological project coordinator. In August 2021, he told the Kansas City Business Journal that his work on airborne biological agents in Ukraine had helped Black &amp; Veatch to develop a device for purifying air of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, the virus that causes COVID-19. Lippencott is a graduate of the US Army Military Academy at West Point. In one of the documents published by the MoD, a report from the Security Service of Ukraine\u2019s Kherson region referred to \u201ca potential threat to the epidemiological and epizootic situation in our country that has recently come to light as a result of DTRA\u2019s intentions through Black &amp; Veatch to establish control over the functioning of Ukrainian microbiological laboratories that conduct research into particularly dangerous pathogens that can be used to create or upgrade new types of biological weapons.\u201d Another document from Lippencott to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense concerns the extension of the UP-8 project mentioned above. \"Issues of biomonitoring and transfer of information were supervised by David Mustra, who is closely associated with another Pentagon contractor, Metabiota,\u201d Konashenkov said. \u201cPreviously, he led military bio-projects in Ukraine and Eastern Europe as part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program.\u201d Mustra was the company\u2019s biosafety recruitment manager in Ukraine, its biosurveillance and control managers, and the head of Metabiota\u2019s research and development. With a doctorate in microbiology from UMass Amherst, Guttieri was the Executive Vice President at Metabiota from 2014 until 2019, and was previously the vice president of its Science &amp; Technology Administration. She is now the lead scientist at Labyrinth Global Health. In Ukraine, Guttieri was the integrator of research projects for the US biology program and supervised the execution of biological projects related to the research of animals as vectors of disease. Madhav has been the CEO of Metabiota since 2019. She specializes in epidemiology and pandemics and has a PhD in Public Health. However, according to the Russian MoD, there was no information in the documents about her supervising any specific biological programs in Ukraine. Thorton was Metabiota\u2019s senior microbiologist and laboratory start-up coordinator between 2006 and 2016. He previously spent 20 years in the US Navy, where he worked as a research microbiologist and head of the Navy\u2019s Threat Assessment Department. According to his CV, Thornton did his work at secret facilities, including one in Cairo, Egypt, and \u201cconducted research on disease agents of military relevance, especially enteric pathogens.\u201d In Ukraine, Thornton advised local staff on highly dangerous pathogens as well as other epidemic disease related issues in DTRA projects, and coordinated the upgrade of reference laboratories in Ukraine to biosafety level 3 (BSL-3), which are used to study infectious agents or toxins that may be transmitted through the air and cause potentially lethal infections.

Under Joe Biden, the North Korean problem has been relegated to the back burner. A recent test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) allegedly capable of striking targets across the US demonstrates the folly of allowing diplomacy to languish.North Korea\u2019s flight test of an indigenously manufactured ICBM on Thursday serves as a stark reminder that even as the international community wrestles with the consequences of Russia\u2019s \u201cspecial operation\u201d in Ukraine, the world outside Europe remains a very dangerous place, with the potential for becoming even more so.The launch of the Hwasong-17 ICBM, which had been publicly unveiled at an October 2020 military parade in Pyongyang and again at a defense exhibition in October 2021, represents a dramatic leap forward in terms of North Korean military capability.The test, which used a mobile launcher from a site adjacent to Pyongyang International Airport, was conducted using a lofted trajectory that, according to North Korean media, saw the missile travel 1,090km (681 miles) for 67 minutes, reaching an altitude of around 6,250km (3,905 miles), before accurately hitting its intended target in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Japan.\u00a0The flight parameters of the missile test would give the Hwasong-17 a demonstrated range of just under 15,000km (9,320 miles) \u2013 more than enough to hit any target in the continental United States.Reportedly, North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, personally oversaw the launch of the Hwasong-17 \u2013 a missile he claimed had been developed due to \u201cthe inevitability of the long-standing confrontation with the US imperialists, accompanied by the danger of a nuclear war.\u201d According to his nation\u2019s state-run media, it is capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads, \u201cexactly met the design requirements,\u201d and was assessed as being ready for operations \u201cunder wartime environment and conditions.\u201dThursday\u2019s test had been preceded by a series of missile launches that appeared to have been related to the testing of individual components in preparation for the full-scale testing of the missile. While these tests, which used the Hwasong-17 as a booster to launch military reconnaissance satellites, did not have the rocket fly to its full potential range, they did serve to validate its propulsion system, as well as its ability to separate a payload with precision in space \u2013 both essential tasks for an operational ICBM-capable missile.North Korea has been unable to achieve any meaningful diplomatic traction with the Biden administration, after four years of unprecedented yet ultimately fruitless direct engagement with the Trump administration and President Trump personally. As part of the now-stalled denuclearization talks, in 2018, North Korea undertook a self-imposed moratorium on the testing of long-range missiles.The ICBM test is a clear demonstration that Pyongyong believes the diplomatic window that had been opened with the US under Trump is now closed, and, as such, was in keeping with the goal of enhancing North Korea\u2019s self-defense capabilities that Kim had outlined in his end-of-year message to the nation.The Biden administration has committed toa policy built around a notional \u201cPacific pivot\u201d that would place the issue of North Korea and, in particular, its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, at the forefront. A disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, coupled with heightened tensions with Russia over Ukraine, have prevented this \u201cpivot\u201d from making the transition from paper to action, however.The important takeaway from the testing of the Hwasong-17 isn\u2019t that North Korea is preparing for war, but rather that it is seeking to create an environment in which a diplomatic solution to the ongoing standoff with the West can once again take priority. Kim, in the aforementioned end-of-year speech, in December, did not emphasize military strength, but rather domestic frailty, acknowledging for the first time that his country was suffering acute food shortages. With devastating floods crippling North Korean rice production, the UN estimates the country is facing a food deficit of nearly 860,000 tons (780,179 tonnes), which can only be met with international assistance.The missile test, viewed in this context, is an important indicator of how Pyongyong seeks to move forward diplomatically in what has been a vacuum of US leadership. As such, it\u2019s in keeping with its usual practice, which is to send diplomatic signals through demonstrations of military strength. However, these serve only to highlight the underlying insecurity of the reclusive nation, which remains at loggerheads with the US, South Korea, and Japan over the diplomatic path toward resolving decades of isolation and confrontation.\u00a0If the only response by the US and the West to the testing of the Hwasong-17 is yet another round of economic sanctions, it may have no choice but to escalate its actions, most likely in the form of renewed nuclear weapons testing. The main problem today isn\u2019t North Korean belligerency, but a lack of US vision in exploiting the opportunity created by Pyongyong\u2019s measured provocation."},{"uuid":"7bee875d-22aa-4c92-b698-271aa5dde5da","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552534-germany-gas-shortage-test\/","title":"German state agency reveals how gas shortage affects public life","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623af93185f540159d2a2172.jpg","subtitle":"The sudden drop in supplies will hit every crucial service, from hospitals to police","content":"A 2018 stress test run by the German civil defense agency, the BBK, found that all crucial services will be impacted by a gas supply shortage. Newspaper Die Welt revisited the exercise on Tuesday amid calls for Berlin to stop purchasing energy from Russia as part of sanctions in response to Moscow's ongoing military campaign against Ukraine.The two-day crisis management exercise Lukex 18, which involved several states in southern Germany, found that the shortage of gas supply will have \u201ca drastic effect on public life,\u201d including the closure of public and private facilities.The disruption of supply will also lead to \u201cfar-reaching, difficult-to-predict consequences for the service sector and the production of goods,\u201d according to the BBK.The BBK warned of personnel shortages because people will be unable to drop their children off at daycare centers, while hospitals and retirement homes may have trouble preparing meals.\u201cLikewise, a high number of illnesses related to the cold are to be expected,\u201d the agency said, adding that it will also lead to staff shortages in government departments, police, and civil protection services.The agency also said that during prolonged cold some people, especially those living in cities, might resort to keeping themselves warm by using fireplaces at home, or building makeshift fireplaces, which will lead to a spike in fires.In a video released on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, once again, asked Germany to stop buying energy from Russia. Some German politicians share the urgency. \u201cI think it'll be tough, but doable, and that's why we should do it. But instead, the economy minister is spreading catastrophic scenarios,\u201d Norbert Roettgen, an MP, told reporters last week.Berlin agreed to look for alternative suppliers and reached a deal to get liquefied natural gas from Qatar this week. However, the country has been hesitant to do away with Russian oil and gas just yet.Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned last week that Germany will see more unemployment and poverty if it immediately pulls the plug on Russian gas. \u201cIf we do not obtain more gas next winter and if deliveries from Russia were to be cut, then we would not have enough gas to heat all our houses and keep all our industry going,\u201d Habeck said on Monday.Chancellor Olaf Scholz reiterated on Tuesday that sanctions were \u201cthe right approach,\u201d emphasizing that they also must be \u201cbearable in terms of the repercussions for the development of the national economy.\u201dUS President Joe Biden will meet European leaders in Brussels on Thursday, as the White House prepares to unveil new sanctions, Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, said. Washington banned imports of Russian energy this month, and has been long pressuring states like Germany to do the same.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

Moscow and Kiev have held three rounds of in-person talks and further contacts via video link, but the exchanges\u00a0have failed to yield any tangible result apart from the two sides finding some common ground on humanitarian corridors and evacuation of civilians from combat zones.In mid-March, the Financial Times reported an imminent breakthrough in the talks, claiming that the two sides had drafted a 15-point peace plan. The report, however, was refuted by both Moscow and Kiev, while no actual breakthrough occurred. The new claims by the newspaper have not prompted any official reaction so far.The latest prediction\u00a0appeared to directly contradict fresh statements by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who told Serbian media that both \u201cdenazification\u201d and \u201cdemilitarization\u201d remain among the main goals of Moscow.\u201cIt\u2019s in our interest that these negotiations yield a result.

","content":"An ex-Trump official and a former officer of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have locked horns over the authenticity of the Hunter Biden laptop-related story in a Twitter war of words. The row happened late last week, when Richard Grenell, the former acting director of national intelligence responded to a post by retired CIA officer John Sipher, who tweeted about ethical behaviour among public servants. He was referring to a letter signed by 51 former intelligence officials, including Sipher, and released after the New York Post (NYP) in October 2020 revealed the existence of what was purported to be Hunter Biden's laptop, which contained damning information on his business dealings in Ukraine that implicated his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden. As for Sipher, he was among the scores of signatories who then refused to apologise for their signing the letter after another US newspaper, The New York Times, \"authenticated\" the existence of the laptop, which was earlier described by the newspaper as \"Russian disinformation\". This was mentioned by Grenell after his Twitter showdown with Sipher entered its second day. \u200bIn a subsequent post, Grenell wrote that while he was calling for sanctions on Nord Stream 2, Sipher was claiming Hunter Biden's laptop was Russian disinformation. \"You lied. There wasn't a single piece of intel that suggested it\", he added. Sipher responded by tweeting that \u200b\u201d\"there are no lies there\" and that \"the Russians clearly used the issue to damage our country [the US] but you and your ilk merely enabled and furthered Russian disinformation\". The ex-CIA officer argued that Grenell \"will support anything \u2013 even lies \u2013 to suck up to Trump\". Sipher cracked back posting that the remarks come from \"the man who failed to say a word when his boss said he trusted [Russian President Vladimir] Putin more than his own intelligence community\". Shortly thereafter, Grenell argued that Sipher \"can run but he can't hide\u200b\", slamming the former CIA officer as \"a phony who lied about intel\". This was followed by the ex-Trump official posting a new tweet that included an image of Sipher blocking his tweets. \"Lol. He signed the letter saying Hunter's laptop was Russian disinformation\u200b\", Grenell tweeted. The story originates with a bombshell New York Post article from October 2020, which exposed alleged corruption by the former vice president's son and apparent involvement of Joe Biden in Hunter's business deals. The laptop in question, containing a trove of potentially damning documents and described by then-President Donald Trump as \"the laptop from hell\", was reportedly abandoned by Hunter Biden at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. The younger Biden recently said that the laptop could have \"absolutely\" belonged to him, but added that he had never taken it to an IT store and claimed the device was perhaps stolen or hacked by Russian intelligence. In the October 2020 article, the NYP mentioned two alleged emails that Hunter Biden purportedly received from a top official at the Ukrainian company Burisma while he was on the board of the firm. In a May 2014 email, Burisma board adviser Vadym Pozharskyi purportedly asked Joe Biden's son to \"use [his] influence\" to politically support the Ukrainian company, while in another email, dated April 2015, Pozharskyi thanked the younger Biden for arranging a meeting with his father, then-US Vice President Joe Biden. POTUS has repeatedly denied that he had any knowledge about his son's work and financial gains. Former US Attorney General William Barr claimed after the release of the NYT's article about the authenticity of the laptop that Joe Biden \"lied to the American people\" during a presidential debate when he called the NYP's exposure of Hunter's emails \"a Russian plant\".

The Russian Ambassador earlier confirmed that he received a note from the Polish foreign ministry demanding the expulsion of 45 Russian diplomats over alleged espionage. Earlier in the day, the spokesman of the Russian diplomatic mission, Vladimir Aleksandrov, said that the Polish foreign ministry had summoned Andreyev. The Russian Ambassador to Warsaw slammed the decision as unfounded, noting that embassy employees were engaged in normal diplomatic and commercial activities. He added that diplomats on the list were to leave the country no later than in five days. Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Moscow would respond in kind to an expulsion of Russian diplomats from Poland. According to the website of the Russian Embassy in Warsaw, it employs slightly over 50 diplomats. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, weighing in on the reports on Wednesday, said Moscow will retaliate to Warsaw's decision. Earlier in the day, Stanislav Zharin, a spokesman for the Polish secret services' coordinating minister, said that Poland's Internal Security Agency had compiled a list of 45 Russian diplomats suspected of espionage, and demanded their expulsion. Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine after the Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for help in defending themselves against continued attacks from Kiev forces. Moscow has reiterated that the aim of its special operation is to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine, with exclusively military infrastructure targeted. Russia added that it had no plans to occupy Ukraine. However, in response to what has been labelled \u201can invasion\u201d, the US and its allies have been funneling military assistance to Ukraine, while slapping Moscow with massive sanctions. Thus, on Tuesday, Poland froze 140 million zloty ($33 million) of Russian assets as part of sanctions against Moscow, said government spokesman Piotr Muller. US President Joe Biden will be heading to Poland after the NATO summit scheduled to be held in Brussels on 24 March, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said earlier. According to the White House, the Brussels talks between NATO allies, G7 and EU leaders, will focus on \"international efforts to support Ukraine and impose severe and unprecedented costs on Russia\" over its ongoing operation in Ukraine.

The presence of US troops on its territory has been growing rapidly since August 2020, and the stance currently adopted by Polish authorities is much more dangerous for pan-European security than the mythical \"Russian threat\" that Warsaw constantly talks about. Authorities in Poland are also maliciously promoting a false version of their country's history of relations with Russia, depicting the latter as a hostile country, Medvedev wrote in his article for the Sputnik Polska. Poland hopes that its role in Europe might be significantly boosted at the expense of Kiev and vehemently declares its support for the latter, but the country's authorities are in a difficult situation. Costs of settling Ukrainian refugees, and in Poland their number is already approaching two million, are covered by the US, and Polish authorities are in no rush to invest their own funds, emphasized Dmitry Medvedev. According to the Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman, Polish authorities are willing to sacrifice the well-being of their country's citizens, their own economic interests as they succumb to a frantic Russophobic policy. One of the most painful issues for Poland is gas, underscored Medvedev, as he remarked that Polish citizens were constantly being warned that Russia is gearing up to wield its \"gas weapon\" against a state whose energy system is largely dependent on the purchase of blue fuel. He recalled that Poland has also taken a number of steps against the Nord Stream 2 project and to expand the presence of American companies in the EU gas industry, adding: \"Poland's dream is to become a European hub for the supply of liquefied natural gas from the United States. A terminal for receiving LNG in Swinoujscie has been built and is being expanded, it is planned to build a terminal near Gdansk, gas interconnectors with Lithuania and Slovakia, the Polish-Danish-Norwegian gas pipeline BalticPipe.\u201d Medvedev noted that Poland considers the events in Ukraine, where Russia is conducting a special operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify the country, as an excellent reason to freeze any initiatives related to Russia, support \"the regime of anti-Russian sanctions and whipping up of a  new cold war.\" Warsaw, said Medvedev, has been eyeing the territory of Ukraine, using anti-Russian rhetoric to mask its true intentions. Earlier, a partition map of Ukraine had been displayed on the air of the Polish TV channel TVP1, showing Lvov, Ivano-Frankovsk, Volyn, Rovno and Ternopol regions of Ukraine as part of Poland. Medvedev\u2019s statements come as on Saturday, Russian Ambassador to Poland Sergei Andreev suggested Russia might be forced to temporarily close its embassy in Warsaw. The move is considered after Warsaw earlier announced it was expelling 45 Russian diplomats suspected of spying, in an allegation Andreev dismissed as \"nebulous.\" Poland\u2019s moves have followed in the footsteps of Washington and its NATO allies, which have been drumming up support for the Kiev authorities, pumping the country with weapons, while slapping Russia with sweeping sanctions over its actions in the neighboring country. On 24 February, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Kiev aggression. The Russian defence ministry said the operation is only targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure. Earlier in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decrees recognising the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. The new treaties oblige Moscow with ensuring the security of the two Russian-speaking republics.

Apparently, Hauk sees no issue with the residents of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg \"freezing for freedom\" a bit and believes that it's worth depriving Russia, and specifically President Vladimir Putin, of money from gas sales. The minister proposed this measure as a response to the Russian special military operation in Ukraine. In Hauk's view, such a step from the German government, made at the expense of the comfort of its citizens, would \"make [anti-Russia] sanctions work\". What the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg minister failed to mention in his estimates of the consequences of such step is the impact that abandoning Russian fossil fuels will have on the German economy in general. Fuel and energy prices (and as a result, the price of nearly all products) are bound to rise after Germany does away with Russian supplies, which constitute 55% and 35% of the country's gas and oil imports respectively. German Minister of Economy, Robert Habeck, recently warned that stopping the import of Russian energy resources will have the most drastic consequences for the country's economy. Russia, in turn, recently announced its response to the Western sanctions over the operation in Ukraine and said it will demand that payments for gas from \"unfriendly nations\" be made in rubles instead of dollars or euro. While the EU authorities rejected the idea, citing the existing contracts with Gazprom, it is unclear how they are going to enforce the payments in euro once Moscow implements the measure.

","content":"Robina Qureshi, the head of the charity Positive Action in Housing, has lashed out at a UK government scheme aimed at helping Ukrainian refugees who are fleeing their country amid Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. She said that her charity had been dealing with 483 Ukrainian families, young people, and unaccompanied minors who needed a sponsor to house them, in line with the Homes for Ukraine scheme. According to Qureshi, the forms involved in this government programme are \"tortuous and confusing \u2013 with no guideline\". The Positive Action in Housing head asserted that Ukrainian refugees are turning to \"wholly unsafe methods\" of entering the UK, \"meeting people in Facebook groups, on social media\". Qureshi stated that the British government is \"responsible for giving people false hope and putting them further in the way of danger\". She spoke after Labour MP and Shadow Communities Secretary Lisa Nandy told The Observer that the government should do away with excessive bureaucracy and take more steps to coordinate the matching process so that the Homes for Ukraine scheme can work. This was preceded by The Telegraph reporting that the Homes for Ukraine scheme had descended into chaos as Britons launch bidding wars on social media boasting about their homes. According to the newspaper, users on Facebook are competing against each other, bragging about the size of their houses, bedrooms, as well as leisure facilities located nearby. Ukrainian refugees are said to have received 300 posts each with Brits offering them a place to stay in their houses. The Telegraph claimed that at least 147,000 people have registered for the Homes for Ukraine scheme, citing sources as saying that this amounted to more than 400,000 rooms. Under the Homes for Ukraine programme, residents of Britain have to offer accommodation for Ukrainian refuges for at least six months. The scheme stipulates that the government will provide \"a substantial level of funding to local authorities to enable them to provide much wider support to families to rebuild their lives and fully integrate into\" UK communities and people will have access to public services, work, and benefits. Authorities are offering an optional \"thank you\" payment of \u00a3350 ($460) per month to people who can accommodate one or more households, in sync with the programme. It is limited to one payment per residential address. The scheme was unveiled after the chiefs of the UK's MI5 and MI6 reportedly warned Home Secretary Priti Patel against easing visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees, purportedly due to the risk they could include Daesh* militants and mafia-linked criminals. The Daily Mail quoted unnamed senior intelligence sources as saying that \"no one disputes that this is a humanitarian tragedy, and that 99.9 percent of the refugees [from Ukraine] are genuine\". The sources, however, cautioned that the British government \"cannot just allow a complete open-door policy\", adding, \"Ukraine is a melting pot at the moment, and we have already been presented with fake passports\". UN estimates show that more than 3.2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian special military operation in the country on 24 February. Neighbouring Poland has so far received the most refugees, with others travelling to Hungary, Slovakia, Moldova, Romania, and the UK. Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine in order to demilitarise and de-Nazify the country, following a request for help from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, which saw weeks of intensifying shelling by the Ukrainian Army. The goal of the operation is to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure with high-precision weapons, which do not target civilians, according to the Russian Defence Ministry.

In it, Patel calls Russians \u201cbarbarians,\u201d promises to step up spying on Russians in the UK, and is tricked into calling the pranksters \u201cincredible heroes\u201d and admits that her own country \u201cplays dirty.\u201dThe duo \u2013 real names Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov \u2013 who call themselves \u2018Vovan and Lexus\u2019, set up a video call with Patel last week, in which one impersonated Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmygal. After releasing a teaser clip from the conversation on Thursday, in which Patel said that Britons were fine with Ukrainian \u201cnationalists\u201d settling in their country, the pair released the full 15-minute conversation on Friday.Patel opened by calling Interpol \u201cfeeble\u201d for refusing to suspend Russia\u2019s membership, saying that the UK and its Five Eyes (an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the US) colleagues would continue to push for Russia\u2019s \u201cblanket suspension\u201d from the international policing organization.\u00a0Britain would do this, she said, \u201cbecause of the barbarians that the Russians are.\u201dPatel and the fake Ukrainian PM talked about newly-passed British legislation allowing for the seizure of assets from Russian billionaires in the UK, and when the pranksters asked whether she\u2019d support making this property available to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Patel replied that she \u201cabsolutely\u201d agrees with the sentiment, saying \u201cwe want justice for Ukraine and justice for Ukrainians.\u201dPatel then seemingly admitted to collaborating with Bellingcat, a supposedly \u201cindependent\u201d investigative outlet which Russia has long accused of being operated by Western intelligence agencies. \u201cOur approach is very clear in terms of the organizations we work with,\u201d she said, adding that these organizations help her government \u201cstand up for real facts.\u201dThe pranksters suggested that Patel could step up security checks on Russian students coming to the UK \u201cin a special way,\u201d by asking them to denounce Russian President Vladimir Putin or state their position on Crimea.\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d Patel replied. \u201cWe have some of the finest security checks, and working with our agencies that\u2019s effectively the approach we are taking.\u201d\u201cWe have some very very specialist work taking place on this right now, which clearly we can\u2019t go into much detail on,\u201d the home secretary continued.After asking Patel to say the nationalist slogan \u201cGlory to Ukraine,\u201d the pair then tricked her into saying a Russian phrase that roughly translates as \u201cBritain plays it dirty,\u201d before she gave a shout out to the pranksters themselves, whom she was told were Ukrainian war heroes.\u201cVovan and Lexus, incredible heroes, thanks to them for the work that they have been doing to fight for an independent Ukraine,\u201d she stated.Patel is not the only British government official duped by the pair in recent days. In another teaser clip recorded last week and posted on Tuesday, the pair spoke to British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. Again posing as Shmygal, one of the two attempted to talk Wallace into helping Ukraine develop nuclear weapons. Wallace was enthusiastic, but did not give an official affirmation.Downing Street has accused Vovan and Lexus of working for the Russian state, calling their prank videos \u201cstandard practice for Russian information operations.\u201d The pair have consistently denied working for the Kremlin,\u00a0insisting their work is purely media in nature.\u00a0\u00a0"},{"uuid":"7ff1209d-022d-43d8-aa8a-d70d64796d7c","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220326\/gop-wants-to-subpoena-hunter-biden-over-leaked-emails-if-they-regain-majority-in-congress-1094227404.html","title":"GOP Wants to Subpoena Hunter Biden Over Leaked Emails If They Regain Majority in Congress","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e6\/03\/12\/1093980361_0:0:1921:1673_1440x900_80_0_1_50f2d8ae0dc73514a501131d1a5d6a2a.jpg?source-sid=ap_photo","subtitle":"More than a year after the presidential election and long after the story of Hunter Biden's infamous laptop was suppressed by much of the media, The New York Times finally acknowledged the authenticity of the extracted emails revealing the controversial dealings of the president\u2019s son, who actively exploited the political influence of his family.","content":"Republican congressmen say they are ready to subpoena Hunter Biden and question him on his purported nefarious dealings abroad as well as the extent of the current US president's involvement if the GOP regains a majority in Congress, the New York Post reported on Saturday. She added that \u201cthe American people absolutely deserve answers.\u201d Stefanik referred to speculation that President Joe Biden could also have been involved in his son\u2019s dealings, as the \u201cbig guy,\u201d mentioned in the emails, was said to be his cover name. While legal experts stress that it might be challenging to prosecute Hunter Biden, as even if he did find himself before Congress, he would likely invoke the 5th amendment, Stefanik claimed that \u201cthe subpoenas will rain down if they do not turn over documents and answer our questions.\u201d A \u201cSenate report found that a firm linked to Hunter Biden got $3.5 million from a Russian billionaire who has yet to face US sanctions for Putin\u2019s genocide in Ukraine. Why were they left off Joe Biden\u2019s sanction list?\u201d Stefanik asked. Last week, Republican Senators Ron Johnson and Rand Paul said they plan to investigate the Biden family if the GOP takes over Congress after the midterm elections. In addition, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., has written letters to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, chief of staff Ronald Klain, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, as well as multiple former US intelligence officials, and others, demanding that they preserve all Hunter Biden-related records. In October 2020, the New York Post published a series of materials based on correspondence allegedly found on Hunter Biden's laptop found in a Delaware repair shop. The owner of the workshop made a copy of the hard drive, which was given to Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and personal lawyer of then US President Donald Trump. The laptop was reportedly later seized by the FBI. The emails showed that Hunter Biden, employed by Ukrainian company Burisma between 2014 and 2019, organized a meeting with Joe Biden on behalf of the firm's management. Some of the documents, according to the reports, indicate the Bidens were abusing their authority to make beneficial deals with a wealthy Communist Party-linked Chinese tycoon. In an email in May 2017 from partner James Gilliar, it appears that Hunter was reportedly getting a 20 percent stake in the venture, with another 10 percent owned by the \u201cbig guy.\u201d According to Hunter Biden's former business partner Tony Bobulinski, the \u201cbig guy\u201d refers to Joe Biden, who, according to one of the emails, rejected the deal. Hunter Biden has, so far, denied all accusations and the US president has said he wasn\u2019t aware of his son\u2019s dealings. A month before the presidential race, all these reports were dubbed as a \"Russian disinformation\u201d campaign, with some major outlets saying the leaked information did not prove the allegations and did not warrant a potential tax fraud and money laundering investigation. While the story received sporadic coverage in mass media, the two major social media platforms  took measures to limit it even more. Twitter and Facebook users were not allowed to post or share the New York Post story with other users, with Twitter even banning the newspaper's account in the crucial days leading up to the election. Meanwhile, around half of those who voted for the current US president did not know about the laptop story, according to a survey conducted by The Media Research Centre. The poll also showed that around 10 percent would have changed their vote if they had known about the leaked emails, which could have altered the outcome of the presidential election, which Biden won by a 4.4 percent margin over Trump. After The New York Times acknowledged the authenticity of the emails on March 17, some Republican lawmakers also called for US mainstream media outlets and Big Tech companies to be prosecuted for hushing up the laptop story.

At what price will the new package of sanctions come for the Europeans?","content":"\"The economic consequences for Europe are already dire, and they're just going to be worse. Unlike Russia, Europe is not self-sufficient when it comes to energy, nor when it comes to the production of food. So the price of food will climb and, in general, the living standard in Europe will fall,\" says Professor Stevan Gajic, a research associate at the Institute of European Studies in Belgrade. Reuters admitted on 22 March that European energy and commodity markets are currently \"in shock.\" After the beginning of the Russian special operation to \"de-militarise and de-Nazify\" Ukraine, launched under Article 51 of the UN Charter, the US and its NATO allies and partners imposed unprecedented sweeping sanctions on Russia. Since then, prices across gas, oil, metals and agricultural markets have leaped and have become very volatile, according to Reuters.  The UK and the US are also struggling with soaring energy costs, fuel bills and food prices. According to the Office for National Statistics, UK inflation has hit a 30-year high as British consumer prices rose 6.2% from February 2021. The US consumer price index has jumped 7.9% from a year earlier \u2013 a fresh 40-year-high \u2013 according to the Labor Department. Meanwhile, the price of natural gas in Europe exceeded $1,350 per 1,000 cubic meters on 23 March, following Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement that Russia will start selling gas to \"unfriendly countries\" in rubles. Both Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures remain well above $100 per barrel, seeing yet another hike on Wednesday on the news of the possible expansion of Russia energy embargo. Energy markets are now struggling to  tackle the potential loss of about 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from Russia given that any replacement oil is likely to be months away. If Europe were to go ahead and ban the import of Russian oil, coal, gas and other energy sources, then energy prices would rise substantially in Europe, warns Alexander Clackson, founder of Global Political Insight, a UK-based think tank. Even though this situation creates commercial opportunities for the US in the EU market, the problem is that neither the US nor other energy producers could immediately fill the gap left by Russia's oil and gas supplies, according to the observers. In addition to that, the US is incapable of quickly step up the production of LNG since the US gas industry has been traumatised by the economic pain it felt from 2014-2017 and the pandemic and is currently exercising \"capital discipline,\" according to the energy scholar. When it comes to crude, even though the US is likely to reach nearly 12.6 million barrels per day by 2023, and OPEC is likely to step up crude production in the future, it will take time, says Dargin. \"We are still expected to witness elevated oil prices due to the ban on Russian oil, which will have a negative impact on consumers,\" the energy scholar admits. European countries are aware of the potential consequences of the sanctions spree and remain divided over the imposition of the US-backed oil embargo on Russia, according to Alexander Clackson. Moreover, some countries in the EU are not in favour of any stringent sanctions against Russia, the scholar notes, referring to Hungary: Budapest is \"keen not to isolate Russia completely\". There is also the issue of trade: many Western companies that have pulled out from Russia are going to feel the negative effect from that, according to Clackson. Furthermore, the sanctions war against Russia is likely to backfire against the global economy: \"Global trade and the global economy will significantly decrease because of the sanctions war, which will obviously affect all countries, including the countries of Europe and the United States,\" warns the scholar. Nevertheless, it appears that the elites of major EU members Germany and France are \"too weak to stand\" against the US pressure and the ongoing media hysteria over Russia's Ukraine operation, according to Stevan Gajic.  The volatile economic situation has already resulted in popular protests in Spain. Roughly 150,000 farmers, ranchers and hunters marched through Madrid on 20 March to protest the Spanish government's failure to tackle soaring prices amplified by the EU sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine special op. There is the risk of growing civil unrest in Europe in the future, Gajic forecasts. According to Clackson, for the leadership of Europe and the United States \"the priority has always been to undermine Russia, to contain Russia and ensure that Russia's influence does not grow.\" This policy is coming at a price for ordinary Europeans, he stresses, adding that \"while this process is ongoing, many ordinary people will suffer for the foreseeable future.\" "},{"uuid":"80f41d4f-9c03-4512-9e6e-61a4a18ff7ec","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220322\/us-considers-removing-irans-revolutionary-guards-from-terror-list-but-whats-behind-it-1094075700.html","title":"US Considers Removing Iran's Revolutionary Guards From 'Terror List', But What's Behind It?","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e6\/03\/16\/1094076318_0:0:2500:1772_1440x900_80_0_1_2de4f41da8b3b3f9991707fdfad3aa45.jpg?source-sid=afp","subtitle":"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces, has been under US sanctions since 2007, but it was only in 2017 that it was placed on the American Global Terrorist List, becoming the first national military to be designated as an extremist organisation.","content":"After almost a year of intense talks, a new Iran nuclear deal between might finally be done in a matter of days. Recent reports have suggested that only a few issues are yet to be resolved between Iran and the P5+1 together with the European Union before Washington goes back to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a 2015 agreement which originally lifted some sanctions on Tehran in return for limits on its nuclear programme, but that was dropped unilaterally by Washington back in 2018. A total removal of Western sanctions from the Islamic Republic's businesses, banks, and officials is among the key issues which are yet to be solved. The other one is the exclusion of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces, from the US list of terror organisations. The IRGC has been subject to US sanctions since 2007, but it was only a decade later that the organisation was put on America's Global Terrorist List, becoming the first national military to be designated as such. Now that the US is reportedly considering removing the IRGC from that list, Washington's regional allies are biting their nails. In Israel, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid have already called on the White House \"not to abandon [its] closest allies in exchange for empty promises from terrorists\". In the Gulf, authorities have raised their eyebrows at the American dealings with Iran. \"The removal from the notorious list will make Iran even more radical. The US might not understand it now but this decision will eventually backfire\", he added. The Emirati official says he understands well the reasons pushing Americans to \"such a radical step\". Previously, Washington banned all energy products from Russia over its special military operation in Ukraine that kicked off on 24 February. The move sent energy prices in the US through the roof, and in an attempt to stabilise the market, the White House has approached Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to try to convince them to pump more oil. Those calls have fallen on deaf ears, and this is probably the reason why Washington is now counting on Tehran and its rich energy resources. \"We know what they are trying to do. They want us to pump more oil but we won't be dancing to their tunes\", the Emirati official said. Abu Dhabi has its own accounts to square with the Americans. They didn't appreciate the initial attempts of the Joe Biden administration to halt the supply of 50 F-35 jets and 18 Reaper drones. Nor did they like Washington's decision to get closer to Iran by resuming the negotiations around its nuclear programme. They did not agree with the White House's decision to remove Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have been staging attacks against Emirati targets, from the list of terror organisations. The Emirati official would not discuss the steps his country would take in the event Washington chooses to go ahead with the removal of the IRGC from the notorious list. But he signalled that Abu Dhabi is tired of being dictated to by the US and it might take matters into its own hands. Later in the day, the crown prince of the UAE, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, is expected to meet with Israel's prime minister and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah A-Sisi in Egypt. It is believed that the three will discuss the shaping nuclear deal and what measures the states can take to protect themselves. Will those talks evolve into something more concrete, like a NATO-style defence pact? It\u2019s hard to tell. But now it seems clearer than ever that the UAE no longer believes the US has a shoulder they can lean on.

The fact that countries in the West quit contracts with Russia in several spheres \"just within a night\" is shameful, Ryabkov said. Russia has always been a reliable supplier and intends to continue gas deliveries to Europe; however, the interests of Moscow should be taken into consideration as well, he added. The diplomat hopes that European countries will revise their decision not to pay for gas in rubles and will find a creative approach to the issue.  According to the diplomat, Russia will draw its own conclusions from the racist Russophobia that has been unfolding in the West recently. These anti-Russian sentiments are not related to the situation in Ukraine, the West simply hates Russia, Ryabkov said.  \"...They do not believe that there is place for Russia's independent policy and Russia's independent position on global political arena which we are going to protect,\" the official added.

However, the leadership in both countries has been more reserved.","content":"Governor of the Bank of Finland Olli Rehn has called for Finland to join NATO using an arrangement similar to that of its northern neighbour. Rehn, a former European commissioner, has been a staunch supporter of NATO for decades. He first called for Finland to join NATO in a 1994 opinion piece, when he was a lecturer in political science at the University of Helsinki and a Centre Party MP. Remarkably, in the very same opinion piece he called Ukraine a \"powder keg\". Rehn furthermore suggested that the EU should phase out energy imports in order to limit Russia's foreign income in light of the Ukrainian conflict, in which Russia intervened to protect the inhabitants of the newly-recognised Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk from intensifying attacks by Ukrainian forces. While Russia's stated goal is to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine, the West portrays the special operation as \"invasion\" and has introduced several rounds of crippling sanctions targeting all spheres of life from tech to consumer goods. The Bank of Finland governor noted that EU energy imports from Russia this year are projected to be worth some 600 billion euros at current prices, three times higher than in 2020. Stopping Russian energy exports has been on the European agenda since the start of the operation. Last week, Finnish Finance Minister Annika Saarikko proclaimed that Finland must work to end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Earlier in March, Prime Minister Sanna Marin also said Helsinki intends to drop its energy dependence on Russia \"as soon as possible\", citing a \"shift in views\" across Europe following Russia's special operation in Ukraine. In a pivotal point, Germany decided to suspend the key Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which has been seen as an important tool for guaranteeing Europe's energy security. Finland, for its part, has frozen plans to build a nuclear power plant in partnership with Russia's Rosatom. The NATO debate in traditionally non-aligned Finland has flared up anew since Russia's special operation is Ukraine began. Over recent weeks, two groundbreaking opinion polls emerged, in which around 60 percent of Finns voted in favour of joining the alliance, for the first time in history. Yet, the country's elite has been markedly more cautious. President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 said it was \"clear\" that possible Finnish membership in NATO would permanently increase tensions with Russia along the two countries' 1,300-kilometre-long border. While calling a \"preventive effect\" the greatest benefit of NATO membership, Niinist\u00f6 ventured it would entail various types of Russian retaliation. A similar dynamic has manifested itself in neighbouring Sweden, a fellow non-aligned nation, with recent opinion polls indicating a first-time majority in favour of joining the alliance. The nation's ruling class, however, is considerably more reticent. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Scott Ritter, former UN Weapons Inspector and WMD Whistleblower, has sat down with Sputnik to discuss the special operation.","content":"Sputnik: Speaking to Maverick Multimedia on 19 March, you said that Russia\u2019s special operation in Ukraine is \"close to being over\" in Russia's favour and that Moscow's military op will later be studied by specialists. What's so special about Russia's operation, in your opinion? Scott Ritter: I think the thing that separates the Russian special operation in Ukraine, apart from other military operations of this nature, is the fact that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine. This is something that the Russian leadership has said from the very start. A military operation that is designed to occupy is a much more complicated operation requiring significantly more troops. It is about holding cities, holding roads, holding specific geographical areas.  This kind of focus allows Russia to avoid the trap of being compelled to carry out operations to conquer territory, instead, to focus on a more specific task of eliminating military formations with the goal of eventually leaving Ukraine. Sputnik: Why are the Western mainstream media continuing to claim that Russia's Ukraine operation has stalled? Does it mean that they do not understand Russia's strategy and objectives? Or does this narrative serve some other purposes? Scott Ritter: I think there are two reasons why the West is mischaracterising the Russian military operation in Ukraine. First is that the West is evaluating this as if it were Russia's intent to occupy Ukraine. From the very start, the fact that Russia is coming in with only 200,000 troops makes no military sense when we are speaking of a nation of 40 million people with a combined military capability of around 600,000 troops.  The other aspect of the mischaracterisation is that there is an information warfare aspect to this war. The West is hopeful that they will be able to use the Russian operation in Ukraine as a vehicle to motivate domestic political unrest in Russia that will at a minimum compel the Russian leadership to withdraw from Ukraine with its mission unfinished, and at a maximum lead to the overthrow, the removal of the Russian president and the Russian government, sort of a colour revolution, if you'd like to say so.  In order to do this, they are creating a picture of a military disaster in Ukraine on the part of the Russian military, and they're trying to project this narrative of a military disaster back into Russia in an effort to demoralise the Russian population and provide the impetus for massive popular demonstrations against the Russian government. Sputnik: Western pundits, politicians and experts are speculating about Russia's \"possible chemical attack\" in Ukraine. They have not presented evidence that Russia possesses such weapons, nor provided any proof that such plans exist. What could be the primary purpose of this narrative? Scott Ritter: The current narrative being put out by Western leaders and the Western media about the Russians preparing a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine is born of the standard reaction when one side is caught doing something that they shouldn't have been doing and they seek to project blame onto the other side. There is no doubt in my mind that the Russians are not preparing a chemical weapons attack. This makes no sense from both a military and political standpoint. Plus, it presumes the existence of a military-scale chemical warfare capability in Russia that Russia simply doesn't possess. But what has happened is that Russia has discovered biological research facilities inside Ukraine, operated by the United States Department of Defense, and they've discovered certain research activities which are difficult to explain by the United States that could have offensive biological warfare capacity. And the United States is embarrassed by this.  So, it's deflecting the narrative back on to Russia. And in doing so, they expand the narrative based upon past allegations that Russia supported chemical weapons used by the Syrian government in Syria, that Russia used chemical agents against the Skripal family in the United Kingdom. That Russia used chemical agents against the political dissident Navalny in Russia. And therefore, because Russia is \"guilty\" of all three of these things, Russia is preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine. It's an absurdity. It's ridiculous, but it's part and parcel of the ongoing information warfare campaign being waged by the West against Russia. Sputnik: NATO has been increasing its military presence along its eastern borders since the beginning of the Russian special operation in Ukraine. What's behind this military build-up, in your opinion? Scott Ritter: The ongoing NATO build-up on its eastern flank, I believe, is an exercise in confidence-building on the part of NATO. We are talking about an organisation that has just gone through, in this past summer, a terribly demoralising withdrawal from Afghanistan. One that made it question its relationship with the premiere power in NATO, the United States. And question the ongoing viability of NATO as a military alliance. I mean what is the purpose of NATO? The Russian incursion into Ukraine has breathed new life into those who believe that there is an ongoing purpose to NATO. But it is one thing to say NATO is relevant, it is another thing to make NATO relevant. And one of the things we know about NATO in the past decade or so is that it is militarily impotent. It doesn't have viable military capacity. There are ongoing discussions in Brussels right now in the emergency summit that NATO has convened about the possibility of putting NATO's peacekeeping forces into western Ukraine. You know, this is insanity. Under any circumstances, NATO does not have the ability to do this and prevail. But again, they've assembled these forces, they're looking in the mirror, they think they like what they see and they think that there's real muscle there. And, who knows, they may be compelled to believe that they have more capability than they really do and try to project these forces in the west of Ukraine, in which case there will be, unfortunately, a military clash between NATO and Russia. Sputnik: What are the odds of NATO troops getting involved in the Ukraine conflict? Scott Ritter: If someone had asked me at the beginning of the Russian incursion into Ukraine what are the odds of NATO getting involved? I would say zero because NATO had made it clear that it was not going to get involved in any fight between Ukraine and Russia on Ukrainian territory. But as this conflict goes on, as millions and millions of Ukrainians seek refuge in NATO countries, we're now looking at an economic and humanitarian catastrophe for NATO. And there are now people talking about not just imposing a no-fly zone, but actually putting NATO peacekeepers on the ground in western Ukraine. I don't think NATO is going to make the decision today to send peacekeepers in, but I do think this issue is being discussed and will be tabled for consideration at a later date. And that later date could come sooner rather than later if more and more refugees appear at the border between Ukraine and NATO nations like Romania, Hungary, and Poland.

The result will be a complete reformatting of the country\u2019s foreign economic relations and its economic model, as well as Russia and the US sinking into a protracted military-political confrontation in Eastern Europe.Both factors will have a direct impact on the situation in East Asia amidst a gradually growing confrontation between China and Washington there. As a result of standing on the sidelines of the crisis and calling on the parties to show restraint, Beijing will be the only world center of power to benefit from the Ukrainian catastrophe in the long run. It is possible that the events in Ukraine will predestine China\u2019s success in opposing the United States.The Chinese position on the Ukrainian crisis was expressed to the fullest in a telephone conversation between its Foreign Minister Wang Yi and a number of his European colleagues. In brief, it boils down to five points:China has expressed its regret over the ongoing tragedy, and welcomes any negotiations leading to peace. This is the rhetoric traditionally heard from Beijing regarding conflicts and crises in which it is not involved. The Xi Jiping government has avoided condemning Russia, while leveling veiled criticism at the West for NATO expansion and its unwillingness to listen to Moscow\u2019s security concerns.Chinese officials are not calling Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine an \u2018invasion\u2019. Its state media does not publish materials that present Moscow and its president in a negative light. In the Chinese blogosphere, Vladimir Putin, as well as his actions and rhetoric connected with the Ukrainian operation, are met with wide approval by nationalist-minded people who draw parallels between this situation and China\u2019s relationship with Taiwan.Despite widespread speculation that Beijing, as Russia\u2019s only remaining friendly major trading partner, could put pressure on Moscow to conclude a peace agreement as soon as possible, there is no indication that Beijing has even considered doing so.China has taken a position of neutrality that is friendly to Russia concerning the conflict. Representatives of the country\u2019s Foreign Ministry and the Chinese banking regulator have repeatedly stressed their intention to fully maintain relations with Russia despite the situation.During the UN Security Council vote on the Ukrainian crisis China abstained, electing not to support the Russian veto. But it did the same during the Crimean crisis. In principle, China cannot recognize precedents that support changing the status of territories based on referendums (as happened in the Crimea, Lugansk and Donetsk Republics) since this will affect the Taiwan problem. It should also be noted that Russia does not recognize and does not support the Chinese position in its territorial dispute with India, or Chinese claims in the South China and East China Seas.American statements about having \u2018discussions\u2019 with China about the situation surrounding Ukraine and even of China giving some consideration to Westent sanctions are divorced from reality. This is not the first time this situation has occurred. In 2014, President Barack Obama tried to convince the Chinese not to conclude an agreement with Russia on the construction of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline, which was nonetheless signed in May of the same year.As in the previous stages of the Ukrainian crisis, Chinese companies and banks operating on the world market should take into account the possible negative impact of US and EU sanctions. In this respect, they do not differ from the businesses of any other country. However, the Chinese typically exhibit an acute fear of falling under punitive American measures, which leads them to a wide interpretation of sanctions.Therefore, regardless of the position of the Chinese government, sanctions have always had a certain negative impact on Russian-Chinese cooperation. In addition, the shock effect from the disruption of usual payment mechanisms, production chains, and logistics in the coming months will inevitably manifest itself. Businesses will have to find new ways of operating.At the same time, the parties have so far carried out significant work to put a secure infrastructure in place to ensure bilateral trade, and such efforts have continued until very recently. In 2020, the share of the ruble in bilateral trade reached 7 percent, and the yuan \u2013 17 percent. China is striving to internationalize its currency, and it can now be used for settlements between non-residents of the country.Preparing for a tough conflict with the West, Russia has sharply increased the share of yuan in its gold and foreign exchange reserves. According to some estimates, the Bank of Russia has $140 billion worth of Chinese government bonds denominated in yuan alone. Indirectly, this may also indicate that the current volume of sanctions has been expected for a long time.In addition, China\u2019s CFETS trading system and the Moscow Exchange have been trading in the yuan-ruble currency pair since 2010. Thus, conditions exist for all trade between the two countries to be shifted to national currencies, mainly to the yuan, due to the volatility of the ruble.In 2020 and 2021, China\u2019s share of Russian trade was about 18 percent. Beijing is Moscow\u2019s largest nation state trading partner, although the EU as a whole takes a bigger share. It was about 38 percent in 2020. Since 1999, the China\u2019s share has been steadily rising, while the EU\u2019s has been gradually falling since the second half of the 2000s.If this trend were to continue, one would expect the levels of the China and the EU in Russian trade to be roughly equal in the early-mid 2030s. However, with the EU\u2019s embargo of Russian imports, the process of reorienting to China may slightly accelerate, and China could become Russia\u2019s main trading partner within the next two or three years. As a result, the trade between Russia and its main trading partner will be safe from external influences.A sharp increase in Russian raw material exports to China may be constrained by lack of appropriate infrastructure, including the capacity of railways, pipelines, and port terminals. China exports mainly finished goods, which are less dependent on transport capacity.Consequently, in the next free years, we should expect a sharp increase in Chinese exports to Russia with a more modest increase in Russian exports to China. There may be a significant imbalance in favor of Beijing in Russian-Chinese trade for some time.In this context, the early accumulation of huge yuan reserves indicates that Russia\u2019s authorities have been preparing for something resembling the current configuration of economic sanctions.Beijing\u2019s promotion to the role of the sole or main buyer of some types of Russian products and trade in exchange for yuan is likely to mean some price losses for Russian exporters. But, under the current difficult conditions, this can hardly be considered critical. With the development of new logistics, China may eventually replace the European market.The importance of redirecting exports to China means development of the requisite infrastructure in the Far East will need to be accelerated. Given the importance of speed, it will probably have to be built with the involvement of Chinese investment and companies. Construction projects like this can give important impetus to development in the Russian regions.The issue of expediting the conclusion of contracts for this construction will also arise, as well as the question of completing the Soyuz Vostok gas pipeline (a continuation of the Power of Siberia \u2013 2), which taps into the same raw material base as the pipelines to Western Europe, ahead of schedule.China may have significant interest in redirecting Russian raw material exports to itself while converting it to yuan, as this will not only give Beijing numerous political and strategic benefits, but also bring it huge economic gains. In particular, China\u2019s protection from sanctions and embargo attempts will sharply increase, the cost of acquired resources will decrease, while the role of the yuan in world trade will dramatically rise (the internationalization of the yuan is an important goal for Chinese policy).Russia\u2019s earlier attempts to diversify its economic ties with Asia can be considered dead after the region\u2019s three most developed economies (Japan, South Korea, and Singapore) supported anti-Russian sanctions to varying degrees, albeit under severe pressure from the United States.China will inevitably become the dominant partner, and it is possible that, in the near future, its share in Russian trade will be comparable to the peak values of the EU\u2019s share at one time (more than 50 percent).A positive point for Russia is the growth in the number of Chinese companies that have fallen under various kinds of American sanctions which occupy strong positions in mechanical engineering, information and communication technologies, and the aerospace industry. This increase in pressure from US sanctions began in 2020, and there is reason to expect that this will only grow. Sanctioned Chinese companies will not need to fear the costs of working with Russia.Chinese partners, including those under sanctions, are capable of occupying places in many important segments of the Russian market formerly held by European and American companies. This is, first of all, in the sale and production of cars, consumer electronics, and industrial equipment in Russia. In many areas, the Chinese are quite capable of replacing Western suppliers \u2013 sometimes with a moderate loss of quality, and sometimes without.An important area where the Chinese cannot be useful to us as of yet, where they are experiencing problems similar to ours, is the aviation industry. China, like Russia, depends on imported equipment. As in Russia, its own civil aviation programs (ARJ21, C919) are dependent on Western components and vulnerable to sanctions pressure that is already being exerted. Strengthening cooperation in replacing Western civil aircraft is an urgent issue.In order to somehow curb economic dependence on China, Russia will have to use the few tools at its disposal to diversify foreign trade. Nevertheless, it is obvious that, while it is facing an economic blockade by the West, Russia will have no choice but to increasingly expand political and military cooperation with Beijing.The importance for China of Russia\u2019s resource, technological, economic, and military potential amidst confrontation with the United States will allow Russia to avoid sinking into a clearly subordinate position in this partnership. But China will set the tone, nonetheless.The real political goal will be to preserve the ability to restore Russia\u2019s \u2018strategic autonomy\u2019 with a possible weakening of the embargo in the long term.Moscow has not been involved in many disputes between Asian powers, and its policy towards Asia has been independent from China\u2019s, except for that of generally containing the influence of the United States. Now Russia will have to protect its ties with independent players, in particular with India and Vietnam, while sacrificing its relations with US allies in the Indo-Pacific region, primarily Japan and Australia, for the sake of strengthening its partnership with China.The negative trend that has recently emerged in Russian-Japanese relations will sharply intensify. Events like the joint patrol of Russian and Chinese fleets around Japan that took place at the end of 2021 will continue. There may be a question of coordinating the two countries\u2019 positions in territorial disputes with Tokyo (Chinese claims to the Diaoyu \/Senkaku Islands and the problem of Russia\u2019s southern Kuril Islands).As it moves to more actively promote its global initiatives and concepts of world order (Community of Common Destiny, relations between great powers in a new era, the Belt and Road initiative), China may be interested in attracting proactive support from major countries, and it is likely to receive such backing from Russia. Actually, this was already manifested in a joint Russian-Chinese declaration following Vladimir Putin\u2019s visit to China on February 4, 2022.China probably can\u2019t radically ease the shock of the first months or year of the embargo for Russia \u2013 everything will depend on Russian economic policy here. In the long term, Russia\u2019s partnership with China, along with its own industrial policy, will become the basis of a new model for Russian economic development. And, in some respects, a healthier foundation than its previous partnership with the EU. China is less attractive to the elite as a place to extract capital and then permanently relocate, and it has a more rational and predictable system for economic decision-making. Finally, the Chinese economy will grow faster than Europe\u2019s in the foreseeable future, as well as its market demand.China will replace the EU as our main trading partner, and a gradual reversal of trade flows to the East may become a factor in the development of Siberia and the Far East, right down to the relocation of part of the population there from the European part of the country. The negative impact of Western sanctions on Russian-Chinese cooperation will gradually weaken as China itself is drawn into the sanctions confrontation with the West. Another important factor in this will be trading in yuan.With a rational policy, Russia can come out of the Western embargo significantly strengthened, with more diversified foreign trade and better developed export infrastructure in the Far East, as well as more balanced foreign relations that are more resistant to sanctions.The price for this will be the undermining of the policy Moscow had been pursuing for many years to diversify its ties with Asia. Russia will be forced to act in line with China\u2019s Asian policy not only to contain the United States, but also to confront US allies led by Japan. The negative impact of its partnership with China on relations with India and Vietnam can be minimized as long as these countries remain independent players, not unduly beholden to the United States, and, thus, do not become priority targets for Chinese pressure.The question of forming a military alliance with Beijing will most likely not arise in the near future. But hypothetically, it is still impossible to exclude the emergence of a formal Russian-Chinese military alliance, or situational military interaction in the event of military crises in the Pacific. Or, for example, appeals to article 9 of the Russian-Chinese Treaty on Good Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation of 2001. This article stipulates that, in the case of a threat to one of the parties, urgent consultations are to be held to eliminate such a threat. This is quite a realistic prospect in the event of a crisis concerning Taiwan, when Beijing will be interested in Russia\u2019s \u2018nuclear umbrella\u2019 to prevent American intervention."},{"uuid":"8448ff67-4a3a-463e-b354-f35b969df958","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220324\/joe-biden-says-hed-be-very-fortunate-to-face-trump-again-in-2024-election-1094166045.html","title":"Joe Biden Says He\u2019d Be \u2018Very Fortunate\u2019 to Face Trump Again in 2024 Election","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e5\/08\/08\/1083557904_0:0:3641:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_da407405f047ff58fb99761b3b303cef.jpg?source-sid=ap_photo","subtitle":"While discussing the Ukraine crisis at a news conference at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, US President Biden raised some eyebrows as he was asked whether he was worried the next administration may undo the work his foreign policy has done to bring the US and its allies closer.","content":"US President Joe Biden admitted during a Thursday conference that he is not worried about a potential rematch with former US President Donald Trump in the looming 2024 presidential cycle. Trump was notoriously critical of NATO and the G-7 during his campaign and time as president. He also reversed former US President Barack Obama\u2019s signature foreign policy accomplishment - the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which was designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting strict sanctions. The comment brings to mind the \u201cpied piper\u201d strategy employed by the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign, later revealed by Wikileaks. In an email from Clinton staffers to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) the campaign called for a \u201cpied piper\u201d strategy designed to elevate more extreme candidates, forcing the moderate candidates in the field to take far-right positions. The idea was to make the Republican party as a whole look extremist, causing independent and moderate voters to turn away. \u201cWe need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and tell the press to [take] them seriously,\u201d the document attached to the email stated. Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and Ben Carson were listed as potential \u201cpied piper\u201d candidates. Unfortunately for Clinton, Trump ended up winning the primary and eventually the presidency, all while introducing his fringe views to the mainstream. Some might say Biden should take note. Biden likely won\u2019t have to employ such a strategy again if he truly wants to face Trump in 2024. A recent Morning Consult poll found that Trump holds a commanding lead in a potential GOP primary race. Some 47% of Republicans who responded to that poll said Trump would be their preferred choice. Trump has hinted at a potential 2024 run, but has stated that he would wait until after the 2022 midterm elections before making a decision. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

This was Walid Taha from the Ra\u2019am (United Arab List) party, which is part of Israel\u2019s ruling coalition. Ra\u2019am leader Mansour Abbas snubbed the event as he was addressing a conference in the city of Haifa at the time.The opposition Joint List, which unites four Arab parties and holds six seats in the parliament, boycotted the Ukrainian president\u2019s speech altogether.The move was announced beforehand by the left Hadash party, which leads the alliance. Its only Jewish member, Ofer Kassif, explained on Saturday that \u201cunlike the claims we hear in the Western media, and also hear day and night, that this war is like war of the Sons of Light against the Sons of Darkness... but it isn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cFor years, there were crimes against the Russian minority in Ukraine,\u201d Kassif said, apparently referring to up to 14,000 people killed in Kiev\u2019s attacks on the breakaway republics in Donbass since 2014 and the clampdown on the use of the Russian language by the Ukrainian authorities.\u201cIn Ukraine, the regime shamelessly works hand in hand with neo-Nazi militias such as Azov. This is the truth. There is no Sons of Light against the Sons of Darkness here,\u201d the lawmaker pointed out.However, Kassif said he was still against the Russian military operation in Ukraine and urged Moscow to swiftly withdraw its forces from the neighboring country.\u201cOur position is that NATO and its leader America imposed this war,\u201d a spokesman for the Joint List and HadAsh chief Mansour Dahamsheh told the Times of Israel on Sunday.One of Moscow\u2019s demands during the ongoing peace talks with Kiev is for Ukraine to declare itself a neutral country, so it cannot become part of NATO\u2019s eastward expansion, which Russia sees as a major threat to its national security.During his speech, Zelensky, who is Jewish, shamed Israel for not doing enough to help Kiev during the conflict and for refraining from sanctioning Russia. He insisted that the Jewish state should send air defense systems and other weaponry, while also comparing the events in Ukraine to the Holocaust.The latter point angered many Jewish parliamentarians, who accused the Ukrainian leader of distorting history and attempting \u201cto erase the involvement of the Ukrainian people in the extermination of Jews.\u201d The statement by Zelensky \u201cborders on Holocaust denial,\u201d Yuval Steinitz of the Likud party insisted.The Israeli government was less emotional, with Foreign Minister Yair Lapid thanking Zelensky for \u201csharing his feelings and the distress of the Ukrainian people\u201d with the Knesset. \u201cWe will continue to provide assistance to the Ukrainian people in any way that we can,\u201d he stated.Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

Democrats and Republicans alike on Capitol Hill have pushed for a 5-7% increase instead, according to Politico. Congress had approved $782 billion for the current fiscal year.The White House draft seeks $773 billion for the Pentagon alone, with the rest going to the Department of Energy, which maintains the US nuclear arsenal.\u00a0Biden is asking for an additional $682 million for Ukraine, \u201cto counter Russian malign influence and to meet emerging needs related to security, energy, cybersecurity issues, disinformation, macroeconomic stabilization, and civil society resilience,\u201d a budget document says.\u00a0This does not appear to be a response to the current conflict, however, as Stars and Stripes reported that the proposal was largely finished before Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing a Pentagon official.The budget envisions an active-duty force of 1.32 million, with some service branches downsizing while others add strength. The Air Force would add almost 100 and the Space Force almost 200 new personnel, while the army, navy and the Marines would trim about 4,300 or so combined.Research and development funding would be boosted by 9.5% to hit $130.1 billion, the largest-ever increase. Members of the military and civilian Pentagon employees would also get a 4.6% pay rise, the largest in 20 years.Big-ticket purchases include two Virginia-class submarines, more funding for the development of Northrop Grumman\u2019s B-21 bomber, and a smaller purchase of F-35 jets from Lockheed Martin than envisioned previously, according to Bloomberg.While the budget wants $6.9 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative\u00a0\u2013 almost double from the $3.6 billion request in 2022 \u2013 and $1.8 billion for expanding the US military presence in the Indo-Pacific, the base upgrade budget for facilities facing China came in at $451 million, compared to $245 million requested for Europe.Biden had ordered a total withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan last August, arguing among other things that the 20-year war had cost far too much in terms of American money and lives.

He also expressed hope that when it happens, Zelensky would visit Jerusalem.Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow\u2019s military offensive aims to \u201cdemilitarize and denazify\u201d Ukraine\u2019s government. Kiev has repeatedly denied it has a problem with radical nationalism, often pointing to its Jewish president as proof, even though Ukraine has embraced a number of World War II Nazi collaborators, such as Stepan Bandera. The Azov Battalion, a neo-Nazi militia, was used to quell dissent following the US-backed overthrow of Ukraine\u2019s elected leadership in 2014.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

The symptoms purportedly included redness of eyes, constant and painful tearing, as well peeling of the skin on the face and hands. The Moscow-Kiev talks are being held amid Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 24 February. He said that the goal of the operation is to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine, with Russia's Defence Ministry stressing that only Ukrainian military infrastructure will be targeted with high-precision weapons and that the civilian population is not in danger.

The negotiator noted that Ukraine has also agreed in principle to reject the deployment of foreign bases or troops on its territory, and to an obligation to conduct military exercises only with the consent of guarantor states, including Russia. Medinsky recalled that until recently, Ukraine and NATO had ignored Russian proposals to hold talks aimed at guaranteeing Ukrainian security while protecting Russia's national interests. \"Ukraine's entry into NATO and the creation of NATO military bases on its territory seemed to be a settled matter, and only a question of time.\" The country was working on the creation of biological weapons with US patrons, and \"the issue of Ukraine's acquisition of nuclear weapons was also thrown into the public sphere. For all these years, the Kiev regime has been carrying out an outright genocide against the inhabitants of the Donbass region. There is no end to evidence on this matter,\" he said. At the same time, the presidential aide said that evidence has been presented by Moscow that Kiev had been preparing to launch an offensive in the Donbass in the near future, forcing Russia to act when it did or risk a new massacre. Medinsky stressed that Moscow's position on the status of the Donbass (as independent republics) and Crimea (as part of Russia) remains unchanged. His comments followed remarks by Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov earlier on Wednesday that Crimea's status was not up for negotiation. Medinsky and the Russian delegation met with their Ukrainian counterparts in Istanbul, Turkey on Tuesday for another round of negotiations aimed at ending the month-old Russian military operation in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters after the talks, Medinsky said that along with the security guarantees, the two sides discussed Ukraine's possible membership in the European Union (to which he said Moscow does not object in principle), and the idea of having guarantor-states that would ensure Kiev's security, among other issues. Russian deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, who was present with Medinsky at the talks, said Russia would dramatically reduce its military operations in the Kiev and Chernigov regions in a bid to \"increase mutual trust\" and create preconditions for further negotiations. Russia began a large-scale military operation in Ukraine on 24 February after weeks of escalating mortar and artillery fire and sabotage and sniper attacks against the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, whose sovereignty Moscow recognised on 21 February. The security crisis followed nearly eight years of civil war in eastern Ukraine between Kiev forces and the Donbass breakaways, which proclaimed themselves separate states in the aftermath of a western-backed coup d'etat in Kiev in February 2014.

As a result of the incident, the oil deficit on the world market is expected to increase significantly, according to experts.The pipeline, which ships around 1.2 million barrels of crude oil daily from Kazakhstan to Europe and the US, said in a statement the condition of two hoses has not allowed \u201csafe operation of the device.\u201d\u201cWe have to eliminate any risk of oil getting into the sea, so, of course, this equipment was to be decommissioned for preventive maintenance,\u201d CPC Director General Nikolay Gorban explained.He said that the repairs on each of the damaged floating hoses \u2013 which should be fixed one after another rather than simultaneously \u2013 would take at least three weeks. However, the weather conditions remain a major factor when it comes to the work timeline.For now, the company has all the necessary equipment for repairs, but the supply of the spare parts might arise in the future, taking into consideration the current circumstances, the CPC warned.\u201cIn this situation, the management of the Consortium has to report possible reduction in the volume of oil transportation in the nearest future by a factor of three from the requests of shippers,\u201d the pipeline, which is co-owned by Russia, Kazakhstan, and a number of major international oil market players, said in a statement.Temporary disruption to the operation of one of the biggest pipelines in the world will affect many, but especially consumers in southern Europe \u2013 Italy, Spain, and the south of France traditionally receive oil from the affected CPC\u2019s remote mooring device, Russia\u2019s Financial University expert and leading analyst of the National Energy Security Fund Igor Yushkov said.\u201cThere is already a deficit in the world market, and when a pretty large player reduces shipments, at least from this terminal, this will aggravate the deficit, and, apparently, will push the oil prices up,\u201d he said, adding that a redirection of the supplies would \u201crequire time and additional costs.\u201dBesides southern Europe, the incident on CPC might be \u201can unpleasant event for the US,\u201d Yushkov said.\u201cAbout 10-15% of volumes went (from this terminal) to the US market. For the United States, this is also an unpleasant event \u2013 they have just rejected the Russian oil, they need to look for an alternative supplier, and then another supplier interrupts supplies. Therefore, as a result, fuel prices in the US domestic market may rise,\u201d the expert claimed.The timing of the incident, in Yushkov\u2019s words, is \u201cvery unfortunate.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIf this event coincides with other factors, a perfect storm could set in and prices could soar back to $140 to $150 a barrel,\u201d he said.The good thing about today\u2019s news is that the problem is only temporary, stressed another expert, Kirill Rodionov from the Institute for the Development of Technologies in the Fuel and Energy Complex. According to his calculations, \u201cstarting from the third quarter, CPC will resume oil shipments in the same volumes.\u201dThe Russian authorities have pledged to do what they can to reduce the disruption.\u201cNaturally, we would like the recovery to happen as quickly as possible and the consequences to be eliminated, because this affects Russian companies, this affects, among other things, the production of Russian companies in the region.

Tod Wolters, commander of US European Command told American senators on 29 March, falling short of specifying whether he meant permanent basing. In recent months, US military forces have soared from roughly 60,000 to 102,000 in Europe.","content":"\"America\u2019s presence in Europe is one of regional domination over Western Europe and encroachment and encirclement across Eastern Europe along Russia\u2019s borders,\" says Brian Berletic, a geopolitical analyst and former US Marine. \"It has always been a process of escalation, edging ever closer to a conflict with Russia either directly or, as we see unfolding in Ukraine right now, by proxy.\" During a Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday hearing, Gen. Tod Wolters was asked by Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) whether the US should increase the number of troops permanently stationed in Europe, rather than the rotating forces. Wolters responded that his \"suspicion is\" that the US is going to still need more troops in the region \"following the completion of the Ukraine-Russia scenario.\" The general added, however, that the Pentagon has to \"examine the European contributions to make a smart decision about where to go in the future.\" Still, Wolters' remarks left more questions than answers, as it remains unclear whether the additional US military forces would be deployed on a permanent basis. Ritter explains that the US has made it clear that the day of it paying for the expense of sending and sustaining American troops overseas all by itself is over, and it's up to Europe now \"to pay at least a significant part of the cost of hosting these troops.\" The general is aware of these financial and political unknowns, hence his hesitance, adds the military analyst. Meanwhile, the number of US troops deployed across Europe has soared from 60,000 to about 102,000 since October 2021. For comparison's sake, NATO-allied European states hosted a total of 450,000 US military servicemen in 1957, during the Cold War era, according to Axios. Under the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, the transatlantic bloc is prohibited from \"permanent stationing of substantial combat forces\" on its eastern flank. At the same time, one needs to understand that \"the composition of the American forces in Europe right now do not represent the ideal composition of forces that would be needed if the purpose of these forces was to serve as a deterrent against any hypothetical Russian military aggression against NATO,\" argues Ritter. In order to effectively deter Russia, the US would have to deploy heavy armored brigades in Europe and keep them permanently there, according to the military analyst. However, it would be expensive for the US to provide these units, and it would be costly for any EU nation to host them, he explains. Furthermore, a meaningful deterrent value would require not one brigade, not two brigades, but probably nine brigades, according to Ritter. \"That's beyond the capacity of the US Army today to provide,\" he says. \"So we would have to form new armored brigades which are a very expensive proposition.\" The US' apparent plan to beef up its military presence in Europe is caused by the fact that Washington's role in Europe \"has always been one of domination over its so-called 'allies' and of ensuring conflict rather than cooperation between Europe and Russia,\" according to Brian Berletic. According to Berletic, if there were no US military presence and no economic or political coercion used by the US, Nord Stream 2 would already be operational, with Europeans \"enjoying cheap, plentiful, and dependable hydrocarbons from Russia.\" Instead, the EU has recently been thrown under the bus by the US and is now \"risking socio-economic ruination,\" the geopolitical analyst points out. Still, EU member states also bear responsibility for the current state of affairs, according to Scott Ritter. He highlights that Europe has long been excessively dependent on the US in terms of security. Ritter outlines two solutions for Europe which would have ensured its strategic autonomy: \u00b7 to work with Russia to redefine a European security framework that de-emphasises the possibility of armed conflict; \u00b7 if security cooperation with Moscow wasn't something that was politically acceptable for Europe, to build up its own inherent military capability to \"deter Russia.\" As the world evolves away from a West-centered unipolar system and embraces multi-polarity, it would be more reasonable for Europe to find a way to economically and politically coexist with Russia, according to the military analyst. This scenario is fraught with further risks, as the Biden administration appears to be interested in prolonging the conflict in Ukraine for as long as possible, thus deepening the rift between Europe and Russia, argues Brian Berletic. US officials' apparent plans to turn Ukraine into Afghanistan 2.0 and amass American troops in Europe could ruin any prospect of healthy and mutually beneficial bilateral relations between Russia and the Old Continent, according to the former US Marine.

Such an involvement would be a disaster, says David T. Pyne, a former U.S. Department of Defen\u0441e officer.","content":"On 9 March, James Jeffrey, a US diplomat who served as Special Representative for the Syria Engagement, proposed creating a \"humanitarian safe zone\" in Western Ukraine under UN Chapter VI in order to put US boots on the ground. According to the diplomat, for this idea to succeed, Joe Biden \"would have to reverse, to a limited degree, his 'no US boots-in-Ukraine' position, but for good reasons.\" Less than a week later, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) made the appeal for a NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Western Ukraine. Under Kaczynski's plan the peacekeeping mission would be backed by armed forces. According to Pyne, some Western politicians are guided by flawed historical analogues: they are wrongfully equating Russia to Nazi Germany, \"bent on the conquest of Europe\", and claiming that any concessions to Moscow would be nothing short of a 1938 Munich Pact-style \"appeasement\". Hence Warsaw's apparent desire \"to get NATO to fight Russia in Ukraine despite the fact that there is virtually no evidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin has any intention of attacking Poland,\" he adds. Moscow has repeatedly warned NATO member-states against intervening in Ukraine amid Russia's special operation, which was launched on 24 February in order to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" the nation. Washington and NATO have dismissed Warsaw's plan and have ruled out the bloc's intervention so far. However, a team of national security officials brought together by the White House have been discussing potential scenarios under which the transatlantic military alliance could get involved in Ukraine, according to The New York Times. Instead of incentivising both Ukraine and the Russian Federation to negotiate a compromise peace agreement, the US and its NATO allies are sending more weapons to Ukraine making President Volodymyr Zelensky much less willing to negotiate the Russian demands, according to the former Pentagon officer. The truth is that the military action could likely have been avoided if the Biden Administration had simply provided a written guarantee to Moscow that Ukraine would never be admitted into NATO, according to the EMP Task Force scholar. \"Russia did not ask for the rollback of NATO\u2019s eastern boundaries, merely that it would never be expanded eastward into additional former Soviet republics,\" he says. \"This was an eminently reasonable request.\" He notes that the fact that the US and NATO leaders viewed Russia's draft security agreements, submitted in mid-December 2021, as \"unacceptable\" shows that \"they are incapable of understanding Russia\u2019s legitimate security concerns and seem unable to understand that Russia is one of the most powerful nuclear superpowers in the world and thus the US and NATO would be wise to see that its vital interests should be respected in exchange for Russia respecting our own.\" On 29 March, Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in Istanbul, Turkey, to discuss peace proposals. Chief Russian Negotiator Vladimir Medinsky revealed that they received written proposals from Ukraine confirming Kiev's readiness for \"a neutral, non-aligned and non-nuclear status, along with a refusal to produce and deploy all types of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and bacteriological ones, and a ban on the presence of foreign military bases and foreign troops on the territory of the country.\" Medinsky elaborated that the position of Kiev will be reviewed by Moscow and presented to President Vladimir Putin. Further negotiations will continue via video conferences for now, according to the chief negotiator. On the same day, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu stated that Russia had accomplished the main tasks of the first phase of the special military operation. According to Shoigu, the combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces has been significantly reduced and now the Russian military can shift to liberating Donbass. Moscow has also announced plans to take military and political de-escalation steps as Kiev demonstrates constructive position with regard to Ukraine's neutral and non-nuclear status. In particular, there would be \"significant reduction\" of military activities in the Kiev and Chernigov directions. Medinsky specified, however, that the move doesn't mean ceasefire and that the advance of the Russian military and Donbass militias continues. Some Western observers rushed to describe Russia's strategic shift as a sign of weakness, claiming that Moscow's initial plan envisaged occupation of Ukraine and capturing its main cities, including Kiev. Still, Russia made it clear from the start that it had no intention to occupy Ukraine. If Russia wanted to occupy Ukraine it would have amassed a much more powerful force; instead it employed approximately 40% of its ground combat units, constituting only 20% of its active duty military forces, according to the EMP Task Force scholar. According to Pyne, Russia's special operation was \"more of a preventative attack from the Russian perspective in reaction to\": \u00b7          Biden\u2019s decision to sign a strategic partnership agreement with Ukraine back in November committing the US to support their joining NATO; \u00b7         the US and NATO's rejection of a mutual security agreement with Russia offered in December 2021, with the limited objectives of ensuring Ukraine\u2019s neutrality and demilitarisation.

Operating in 25 states, it employs civilians who have no accountability before Congress and can bypass the law due to the lack of direct oversight.  The program whose existence has been confirmed by none other than Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland at a Senate Committee hearing on March 8th has been dismissed by the majority of American mainstream media as \u201cconspiracy\u201d in a desperate effort to sweep under the rug one of America\u2019s best kept secrets inside Ukraine. And while the program itself is much larger \u2013 stretching across Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia \u2013 it is its Ukrainian branch that\u2019s been causing anxiety in the Pentagon as well as the Biden administration for the fear that it might fall into the hands of Russian forces.  So what exactly has been going on in the US bio labs in Ukraine? The bio laboratories are operated by the DTRA military program. Furthermore, civilian personnel of these private companies can operate on behalf of the US government under diplomatic cover \u2013 a practice commonly resorted to by the CIA.  There are three such companies operating in Ukraine - Metabiota Inc., Southern Research Institute and Black&amp;Veatch, with key posts held by former, and in some cases, current high-ranking military and intelligence officers.  Besides the Pentagon, these companies run federal biological research projects for the CIA and other government agencies. According to various sources, the DTRA finances about 15 biological laboratories in Ukraine, with data accumulated on ten of them: In accordance with an agreement between the US Department of Defense and Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Health, dated 2005, the Kiev government is prohibited from disclosing any \"sensitive\" information about the American program. In the meantime Ukraine is under obligation to transfer dangerous pathogens from the labs on its territory to the Pentagon for further biological research, in return the US military is granted access to Ukraine\u2019s state secrets related to the ongoing projects. However, a certain US-funded organization, \u201cThe Science and Technology Center in Ukraine\u201d (STCU), was set up the country even before the agreement in question. With its employees endowed with diplomatic status, the center officially supports the projects of scientists who previously worked on Soviet programs to create weapons of mass destruction.  Over the past 20 years, STCU has funneled $285 million in funding and managed an estimated 1850 projects worldwide, The work is officially carried out in line with the 1991-launched programme to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The stated goal is to ensure safe storage and destruction of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as their means of delivery, in the countries of the former Soviet Union. Since Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan destroyed their arsenal of nuclear warheads, on paper the program ended in 2013. However, in 2021, a bill was introduced in the US Congress to renew the programme ostensibly to the \u201creemerged threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass annihilation\u201d. However, according to the Federal Public Procurement website, the programme never actually stopped its operation. In 2013, one of the DTRA contractors for the programme's execution in Ukraine was Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC, with the contract worth $ 43.9 million. In 2016, the STCU itself won a five-year DTRA contract to provide scientific and technical services to a tune of $10 million. Currently, there is no clarity regarding the scope of the STCU\u2019s ongoing activity in Ukraine. While not all of the research is traceable to a tee, US Biolabs mushrooming across Ukraine soil and the American financing of STCU projects coincided with several outbreaks of serious infectious diseases in the country. In January 2016 at least 20 Ukrainian soldiers died of a flu-like virus within a matter of two days in Kharkov, home to one of the US-run laboratories. More than 200 people were hospitalized at the time. By March 2016, 364 fatal cases were recorded throughout Ukraine. The cause of 81% of deaths was swine influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 \u2013 the same one that triggered a global pandemic of the disease in 2009. More recently, another sudden outbreak of an infectious disease, Hepatitis A, was registered in the south-east of Ukraine \u2013 also the site of several Pentagon biolabs. Last January, 37 residents of Nikolaev were hospitalized with jaundice, prompting local police to launch an investigation into suspected \"deliberate infection with the human immunodeficiency virus and other incurable diseases.\u201d Three years ago, more than 100 people in that same city fell ill with cholera. In both cases, it was assumed that the cause was contaminated drinking water. Back in the summer of 2017, 60 people were hospitalized with Hepatitis A in Zaporozhye \u2013 the cause of that outbreak remains unknown. In Odessa region, 19 children had the same diagnosis, while in November 2017, 27 cases were registered in Kharkov. The virus was discovered in potable water. Ukraine witnessed an outbreak of cholera in 2011, with 33 people hospitalized with diarrhea. In 2014, more than 800 people were diagnosed with cholera, with cases spread out across the country. While the outbreaks themselves are hardly evidence enough of any foul play, the diseases in question correlate curiously with the list of the dangerous pathogens the US laboratories have been researching. For example, the Southern Research Institute has a project on cholera, as well as viruses of influenza and Zika \u2013 all of them designated by the Pentagon as pathogens of military importance. Besides the Southern Research Institute, laboratories in Ukraine are managed by two other companies, Black&amp;Veatch and Metabiota. Founded in 1915 in Kansas City, Missouri, Black &amp; Veatch is currently headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas. It specializes in mining, data centers, smart cities, banking and financial markets. In 2020, Black &amp; Veatch was the 7th largest company in the US, boasting a revenue of $3.7 billion in 2020. The activity of Black &amp; Veatch, with a web of over 100 offices around the world, since its inception has been inextricably linked with the US army and intelligence agencies. Black&amp;Veatch won two five-year DTRA contracts worth $198.7 million to build and manage bio laboratories in Ukraine, Germany, Azerbaijan, Cameroon, Thailand, Ethiopia, Vietnam and Armenia. The Federal Purchasing website states that in Ukraine alone Pentagon contractor Black&amp;Veatch has DTRA commitments in line with the \"Biological Joint Participation Program\" worth $140 million since 2013, with work to a tune of $ 77 million yet to be completed. In 2014, Metabiota, specializing in identifying, monitoring and analysing potential disease outbreaks, signed an $18.4 million federal contract as a subcontractor for Black &amp; Veatch in Georgia and Ukraine. Non-profit Southern Research first founded in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1941, as the Alabama Research Institute, conducts fundamental and applied research for commercial and non-profit organizations in four areas: development of medicine, energy, environment and engineering. Throughout the past 70 years, Southern Research has been engaged in research activities linked with national defense. Its early programs for the US Department of Defense included the development of heat- resistant materials for rocket systems returning to Earth's atmosphere. Over the decades, Southern Research expanded the direction of its work to the development of ballistic missile systems, hypersonic vehicles, etc. Since 2008, Southern Research Institute has been the main subcontractor in Ukraine. In 2001 the firm became a Pentagon subcontractor for anthrax research. The main contractor was Advanced Biosystems, led at the time by Ken Alibek, a former Soviet microbiologist and expert in biological weapons from Kazakhstan, who left for the US in 1992. Southern Research Institute is known for actively lobbying research programmes for US intelligence in Congress and the State Department at around the same time that bio laboratories began to emerge in Ukraine and other countries of the former USSR. Thus, the company paid $250,000 to Senator Jeff Sessions (now -US Attorney General) for his lobbying services in 2008-2009, when the Institute won several federal contracts. Overall, from 2006 until 2016, Southern Research Institute forked out some $1.28 million on lobbying to the Senate, House of Representatives, Department of State and Department of Defense. Finally, Metabiota Inc. is the most private of the above-mentioned companies, linked to the biolabs in Ukraine. This could be explained by its links with the family of the President of the United States, Joe Biden, more specifically, his son, Hunter Biden. Founded in 2008, Metabiota is commissioned by governments, insurance companies and livestock breeders to research and evaluate infectious disease threats, digitize global microbial data and actively avert the spread of diseases. At the first stage, it was financed by Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners (RSTP), an offshoot of Rosemont Capital, an investment fund founded by Hunter Biden, the son of US President Joe Biden, and Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former US Secretary of State John Kerry in 2009, in which Biden was managing director. Hunter Biden\u2019s shady former overseas dealings, which concealed a web of corruption in which he sought to use his father\u2019s notoriety to secure unscrupulous business deals from Ukraine to Hong Kong, have swirled for years, but yielded no action on the part of the US or International authorities so far with an investigation still underway. Metabiota is listed in the archived portfolios of RSTP, with financial reports showing RSTP covered the first round of financing for the company to a tune of  $30 million. Since 2014, Metabiota has been a partner of the EcoHealth Alliance within the PREDICT Project of the project of USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program, which aims to carry out global surveillance for pathogens to ostensibly \" identify and prevent the threat of new emerging infectious diseases\u201d. However, as part of these efforts, researchers from Metabiota, EcoHealth Alliance and Wuhan Institute of Virology jointly conducted a study on infectious diseases of bats in China.  Researchers from the EcoHealth Alliance and Metabiota also collaborated over controversial projects on how to \"live safely with bats\", and research linking emerging infectious disease outbreaks with trade in wild animals. Researchers from Metabiota were also listed along with EcoHealth Alliance staff in a 2014 study on the dissemination of the Nipah henipavirus, Ebola monitoring study in 2014, herpes study in 2015. In April 2021, USAID announced a new taxpayer-funded project, led by the EcoHealth Alliance, to track new infections diseases with pandemic potential. Metabiota, whose researchers were listed as authors of articles dated June 2021 related to coronavirus surveillance in Africa, are also linked to the new project spearheaded by EcoHealth Alliance. Metabiota has long been connected to a well-known controversial CIA front, In-Q-Tel, created in 1999 as \"the first state-sponsored venture capital company\u201d. In-Q-Tel is an American non-profit venture capital firm based in Arlington, Virginia, founded to boost national security by \"connecting the Central Intelligence Agency and US intelligence community with venture-backed entrepreneurial companies\". The firm, founded by Norm Augustine, former CEO of Lockheed Martin, and Gilman Louis, who was the first CEO of In Q-Tel, is considered a trendsetter in the information technology industry. In-Q-Tel received funding for at least $120 million in 2016, mainly from the CIA, but also the NSA, FBI and US Department of Defense While In-Q-Tel operates partially publicly, there is a shroud of secrecy over its products and their use, with the most famous known ones being analytical systems for Palantir Technologies data analysis and encrypted messages sharing application. With documents in hand, Russia addressed the damning evidence pertaining to the US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. On 11 March the UN Security Council gathered for a special meeting convened at Russia\u2019s request to discuss the issue. However,  the UN Under-Secretary-General of Disarmament Affairs, Izumi Nakamitsu, said the UN was \u201cnot aware\u201d of any biological weapons program in Ukraine. Washington was quick to denounce Russia\u2019s claims, with Ned Price, spokesperson for the Department of State, accusing it of \u201cinventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own actions in Ukraine.\u201d Russia will demand an explanation of the involvement of Hunter Biden, the son of the American President, in funding pathogen research in Ukraine, said the Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \"...This is very sensitive information - both for us and for the whole world. Of course, we will demand explanations. And we are not alone in it: you know that China has already demanded clarifications from the US, urging them to make this situation transparent to the world...\" emphasized Peskov.

However, despite the horrific bloodshed inflicted on the Iraqi people, the Western public seem to have forgotten so many of the lessons that should have been taken away from the disaster that was the Iraq War.In the build-up to the war on Iraq, Americans were told that eliminating Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, was necessary for world peace. This was due to his alleged possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) as well as his alleged links with Al-Qaeda, among a number of other claims about Hussein\u2019s genocidal ambitions. Britain\u2019s then-prime minister, Tony Blair, even likened Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler; this was at a time when anti-Middle Eastern sentiment was high and the 9\/11 attacks were ripe in the minds of the Western public, who had been informed by then-US President George W. Bush that the \u2018war on terror\u2019 was akin to a\u00a0\u2018crusade\u2019.It turned out that almost none of the major allegations about Saddam Hussein were true, despite the Iraqi president\u2019s other crimes against humanity. Yet,\u00a0with no evidence, Western media fell in line and presented the invasion of Iraq as a just war, despite the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) in Geneva stating that it constituted a war of aggression and a flagrant violation of international law prior to the invasion occurring.\u00a0Likely due in large part to the media coverage at the time, which had demonized everything Middle Eastern and Muslim, US public support for invading Iraq prior to \u2018Operation Iraqi Liberation\u2019 was between 52-64%, jumping up to 72% support on invasion day.In the first two months of the \u2018Shock and Awe\u2019 invasion of Iraq, more than 7,186 Iraqi civilians were said to have been killed. Yet, at the time, Western media outlets were celebrating the US-UK victory as if none of this death and destruction had taken place, never truly asking where the alleged WMD were. A BBC reporter, Andrew Marr,\u00a0said on April 9 of British PM Tony Blair that \u201cHe said they would be able to take Baghdad without a bloodbath and in the end the Iraqis would be celebrating. And on both of those points he has been proven conclusively right.\u201dThe blindly pro-US-UK government coverage went on, despite reports of US and UK war crimes. For example, on April 2, 2003, US aircraft struck a Red Crescent maternity hospital in Baghdad, resulting in a massacre according to The Guardian.Within less than two years of the invasion, it is said that as many as 100,000 innocent Iraqi civilians were killed, yet George W. Bush still managed to get re-elected in 2004. This was with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) not granting permission for the invasion, countless reports of civilian targets being hit, and calls from anti-war voices for the prosecution of Bush and Blair for war crimes.\u00a0On October 6, 2003, Time Magazine was still running cover for the Bush administration, only offering small criticisms of how President Bush miscalculated\u00a0\u201cfixing Iraq,\u201d whilst The Economist went with a headline in May that read:\u00a0\u2018Now, the waging of peace\u2019, which was endorsing the idea of nation-building in Iraq and ignoring the alleged war crimes.Eventually, all the major news outlets in the West, including the likes of CNN, BBC, Fox News, and others, bowed their heads in shame of their\u00a0one-sided reporting on what had occurred in Iraq and what Noam Chomsky called their participation in \u2018manufacturing consent\u2019.Peter Van Buren, a former US State Department official based in Iraq for a year, was asked about whether the Western media had learnt its lesson from Iraq and\u00a0said the following:\u201cLessons learned? No. La [\u2018no\u2019 in Arabic]. Nyet [\u2018no\u2019 in Russian]. As a State Department officer in 2003, I watched in horror as the mainstream press acted not only as stenographers for government lies but amplifiers of those lies, employing anonymous sources at the expense of their own credibility to create and then service a narrative demanding war. When their true editor-in-chief, George W. Bush, stood up, a mix of Ben Bradley and Lou Grant, to proclaim \u2018you were either with us or with the terrorists,\u2019 the media stifled dissent in their ranks nearly completely. In 2022, little has changed. The media again beats the drum for war, albeit this time as stenographers for the Ukrainian government\u2019s propaganda. Almost all of the video and imagery out of Ukraine comes from their government and those anonymous sources of 2003 have been replaced by no real sourcing at all. Crushing dissent has caught up with the times, so voices for restraint are not just left off the New York Times op-ed page, they are canceled, deplatformed, and sent down the social media memory hole, unemployable as Putin-lovers.\u201dToday, the crimes committed in Iraq are well known to the Western public, yet the former leaders of the United States and United Kingdom have never faced consequences for the chaos they caused. Not only has the war left Iraq divided, in terms of de-jure and societal ethno-religious division, but US forces are still stationed in Iraq in their thousands. NATO even announced early last year that they were expanding their own mission to 4,000 personnel\u00a0in Iraq.In addition to this, Iraq has faced the rise and fall of ISIS, a sectarian Sunni-Shia war, US occupation, torture centers, and chemical weapon deployment against civilians, and this has stained the new collective memory of the new generation of Iraqis. The young generation of Iraqis now also face a corrupt Iraqi elite, installed into a confessionalist [sectarian] system of government, which has largely been based on a manufactured political culture of nepotism.Has the US even been able to claim victory in Iraq after 19 years of destruction? Absolutely not. Washington is still battling to hold enough power in the country in order to combat the role of neighboring Iran, which jumped in to fill the power vacuum with its allied forces who were established to fight ISIS and Al-Qaeda.Prior to the removal of Saddam Hussein, Iraq was not a country divided on sectarian lines and did not have a problem with Al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups. The country has been torn apart since 2003 and the same media organizations which religiously took the side of Western governments are today working as the same propaganda machines. The active undermining of the Iraqi experience of war, with countless Western journalists saying things like, we should care more because the bombs are dropping on \u201crelatively civilised\u201d people, can be put down to racism, and it is this sort of dangerous rhetoric which enables Western audiences to ignore the alleged 6 million victims of the failed \u2018war on terror\u2019. Until the perpetrators of the Iraq War are brought to justice, the US government cannot claim the moral high ground over its adversaries, and its position on the world stage shall forever be tainted.\u00a0"},{"uuid":"8ba6f071-d872-4b3d-ac13-3db29a9f1e1b","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552686-three-countries-wont-stop-trade-russia\/","title":"Polish PM names 3 EU countries that won\u2019t stop trade relations with Russia","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623daa8720302740ec07a62d.jpg","subtitle":"Mateusz Morawiecki claims Germany, Austria, and Hungary are acting as \u2018brakes\u2019 for new sanctions amid the Ukraine conflict","content":"Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki named three European countries on Friday that oppose blocking trade relations with Russia, and have acted as \u201cbrakes\u201d with regard to further sanctions in retaliation to its offensive in Ukraine.\u201cPoland strongly emphasized the need to limit the trade in hydrocarbons.

The operation was just one in a string of illegal NATO invasions which still remain unpunished, says retired UN Independent Expert on the Promotion of a Democratic and Equitable International Order, Alfred-Maurice de Zayas.","content":"Sputnik: You say that no violation of the Nuremberg Principles has been graver than the invasion, occupation and devastation of Iraq in 2003. What do you mean? Alfred de Zayas: It was a veritable revolt against the Nuremberg Principles, international law and the international order, the cumulation of the crimes of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity - and all this with total impunity. The vastness of the operation, the viciousness of the bombardment, the destruction of world heritage sites and museums, the use of white phosphorus and cluster bombs, widespread torture at Abu Ghraib and other prisons including Guantanamo, the \u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d program - all this constituted \u201cshock and awe\u201d upon Iraqi victims, a demonstration of imperial power intended to convince the world of America\u2019s hegemony. Let us not forget that the UN Security Council had been seized of the Iraqi situation since 1991, that there was no reason, no urgency to do anything against the government of Iraq that was already cooperating with the UN. Two United Nations inspectors were performing their job on the ground - systematically searching for weapons of mass destruction - and not finding any. Hans Blix and Mohamed el-Baradei were both threatened by the United States to make a false finding that Saddam Hussein was in \u201cmaterial breach\u201d of the relevant Security Council resolutions. This would have provided an \u201cexcuse\u201d, a mantle of legality, for the US to invade Iraq with the blessing of the Security Council. But Blix and el-Baradei never delivered the magic words \u201cmaterial breach\u201d, and the UN had to withdraw its inspectors, because it became apparent that the US would attack with or without approval by the Security Council. The whole operation was criminal and deliberate. It is a disgrace that 90 percent of the West's media supported \u201cshock and awe\u201d and disseminated the fake news and intelligence coming from Washington and London.   Sputnik: According to the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, western media played a great role in whitewashing the illegal US campaign. What's your take on the role western media played in world affairs, given that it still remains mute about eight-year genocide of Russian-speakers in Donbass, and peddling untruthful and distorted narrative of Russia's special operation today? Alfred de Zayas: The western media has been complicit in NATO\u2019s crimes not only in Iraq, but also in Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. Our corporate media (I am an American citizen) engages in flagrant war propaganda and incitement to hatred \u2013 in 2003 against Iraq and the Iraqi people who supported Saddam Hussein, and today against Russia and Russians, who are depicted as aggressors and gross violators of human rights. This Russophobic propaganda did not start in 2022 - it has a long history going back to the Fifties and Joe McCarthy, going back to the demonisation of Brezhnev and Andropov, and more recently of Vladimir Putin. They participated in the demonisation of Saddam Hussein and in the hysteria that accompanied the run-up to the invasion, which UN Secretary General Kofi Annan labelled an \u201cillegal war\u201d several times. Our media does not only disseminate \u201cfake news\u201d and bogus arguments, it also suppresses inconvenient facts, including the massive violations of the 2014 and 2015 Minsk Agreements by Ukraine, the savage shelling of Lugansk and Donetsk, the destruction of hospitals and schools. Anyone who wants to be informed about what is happening in Ukraine must also consult RT, Sputnik, CGTN, Asia Times, Telesur, Prensa Latina and \u201calternative media\u201d such as Greyzone, the Intercept, Consortium News and Counterpunch. Sputnik: Could one qualify NATO as a \"criminal organisation\" for purposes of Article 9 of the Statute of Rome of 8 August 1945 - the statute of the Nuremberg Tribunal? Is there ample evidence and necessary preconditions for it? How could this be done? Alfred de Zayas: I would like to see Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch come out and call a spade a spade. I would like to see the UN Secretary-General, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights engage in more than just \u201cpeace\u201d rhetoric, but to formulate an implementable plan that guarantees a security architecture for all countries in Europe and the world. I would like to see the Secretary-General vindicate the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, including the sovereign equality of states and the right of self-determination of all peoples, including the peoples of Crimea and Donbass. It is time to demand an end to impunity for the crime of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is time to demand that the International Court of Justice declare in an Advisory Opinion that the eastern expansion of NATO entailed a \u201cthreat to international peace and security\u201d for purposes of article 39 of the UN Charter and constituted a violation of article 2(4) of the Charter, which prohibits not only the use of force but also the threat of the use of force. How else can we describe the continuous expansion of NATO in violation of the assurances given to Gorbachev in 1989, 1990 and 1991? How else can we describe the massive rearmament of Ukraine with only one purpose \u2013 to intimidate Russia? NATO is certainly not a \u201cdefensive alliance\u201d \u2013 at least not since the Warsaw Pact was dissolved in 1991. NATO has been trying to usurp the role of the UN Security Council, which has exclusive responsibility for keeping peace and security in the world. Of course, since the Security Council will never agree to impose a \u201cPax Americana\u201d on the rest of the world, NATO unilaterally assumes the role of imperial policeman over the globe and establishes hundreds of military bases intended to encircle not only Russia, but China as well. An Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice could look into the question whether the number and magnitude of these crimes qualify NATO as a \u201ccriminal organisation\u201d for purposes of Article 9 of the London Agreement of 8 August 1945.  Of course, there are serious problems with the concept of a \u201ccriminal organisation\u201d, because we all believe in individual justice and not in guilt by association. It would be necessary to ensure the presumption of innocence of all members of a \u201ccriminal organisation\u201d and guarantee due process as provided for in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. But questions concerning the crimes committed by NATO and NATO countries must be raised. Bearing in mind that NATO has such a long track record of war crimes and crimes against humanity, it is important that history record this sad reality, and that civil society the world over reject the propaganda narratives and demand more transparency and accountability from the leaders of the US and all NATO countries. Here is a task for the International Criminal Court \u2013 to examine whether the violations of Articles 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Statute of Rome by NATO countries justify calling NATO a \u201ccriminal organisation\". Bottom line: International law is by definition universal, and it must be enforced not only against little countries, but against all members of the international community, objectively and without double-standards.

The Fund has significant financial resources of at least $2.4 billion.It was not immediately clear which company Kirillov was specifically referring to because Rosemont Seneca is a decentralized investment fund, comprised of several entities sharing similar names. President Joe Biden\u2019s youngest son Hunter headed the now-defunct DC-based Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, but his legal team has denied his involvement with other branches of the fund, namely the Delaware-based Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC.The Rosemont Seneca fund is closely affiliated with top Pentagon contractors, Kirillov explained, explicitly naming Metabiota, as well as the Black and Veach companies he described as \u201cthe main supplier of equipment for Pentagon biolaboratories around the world.\u201dThe latter concern has been named as a contractor in a 2015 deal between the US government and Ukraine, publicized by the Russian military during the briefing.According to the document, a nearly $32-million program was aimed at \u201corganizing work of the laboratories, built and modernized with the help of the donor [the US government],\u201d as well as \u201cmonitoring infectious diseases\u201d and conducting work to \u201creact rapidly\u201d to outbreaks.

A declaration of Ukraine as a neutral state which will never join the US-led military bloc has been one of Moscow\u2019s key demands during the ongoing peace talks with Kiev.\u201cPeace minded Canadians should redouble our efforts to get Canada out of NATO,\u201d he said.Engler, who is the author of a dozen books, also actively protested the involvement of Canada in the coup in Haiti in 2004. At the time, he crashed a press conference by then-Canadian Foreign Minister Pierre Pettigrew and poured cranberry juice on him, symbolizing the blood of the Haitian people.He is also a strong supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign, which calls for measures against Israel over its occupation of Palestinian lands."},{"uuid":"8ddec285-f4bd-4fb1-9533-0c056dcb72e1","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552488-france-food-vouchers-macron\/","title":"Macron wants to introduce food vouchers","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6239ea4185f5400c0737172e.jpg","subtitle":"The French president has warned of a \u201cglobal food crisis\u201d resulting from military actions in Ukraine","content":"French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated his promise to issue struggling families with food vouchers amid sharp rises in fuel and raw materials costs, caused, as he claimed, by the ongoing Russian military offensive in Ukraine.In an interview with France Bleu radio on Tuesday, Macron said the world is facing \u201ca global food crisis.\u201dEmphasizing that France has advised fellow European countries to come up with a \u201cconcerted response\u201d to this issue, the president, who is facing the election on April 10, said his government has already taken a number of measures, including energy caps and fuel discounts, to support the country\u2019s residents.Stressing that Ukraine and Russia \u201care true barns for the international food supply,\u201d Macron said: \u201cI want to introduce food vouchers to help the most modest households and the middle classes to face these additional costs.\u201d He added that he would also want his compatriots \u201cto buy locally\u201d and to buy French products.Macron has mulled the idea of food vouchers since December 2020, now making it one of his campaign promises.However, the details of a food support program are yet to be revealed. It is not yet known what amount the vouchers would be for, which products they would cover, how exactly they would be distributed and who would be eligible for them.Russia and Ukraine are among the world\u2019s biggest crop suppliers. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the two countries represent 53% of global trade in sunflower oil and seeds and 27% in wheat.\u00a0The European Central Bank had earlier said that food inflation \u201cis expected to remain high throughout 2022\u201d due to high commodity prices and \u201cextraordinary increases\u201d in gas and electricity prices.\u00a0The European Commission is currently working on measures which could increase the EU\u2019s food security.However, as UNCTAD warns, all countries will inevitably be impacted by the conflict-generated crisis. Increases in food and fuel prices \u201cwill affect the most vulnerable in developing countries, putting pressure on the poorest households which spend the highest share of their income on food, resulting in hardship and hunger,\u201d the organization warned.Moscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics with capitals in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

The figures mark a dramatic decline in confidence in a US military intervention, with a similar survey taken in October 2021 finding that 65 percent of respondents believed the US would intervene. 78 percent of respondents in the new poll think Taiwan had no chance of withstanding a Chinese incursion independently, but three quarters of those questioned nevertheless approve prolonging Taiwan\u2019s conscription period beyond the present four months. The polling was conducted 14-15 March, with 1,077 people aged 20 and above surveyed, with an estimated margin of error of 2.99 percent. In mid-2021, a Chicago Council Survey found that 53 percent of Americans were in favour of a formal military alliance with Taiwan. 52 percent also supported using the US military to assist the island\u2019s defence forces at the time. Earlier this month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated China\u2019s position that Taiwan was an \u201cinalienable part of Chinese territory,\u201d and expressed confidence that the island would \u201ceventually return to the embrace of the motherland.\u201d The current Taiwanese government and its US allies have repeatedly accused the People\u2019s Republic of having aggressive designs to \u201cinvade\u201d and \u201cconquer\u201d the island. However, Chinese officials have insisted that the process will be peaceful. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that \u201cto achieve the reunification of the motherland by peaceful means\u201d was \u201cmost in line with the overall interests of the Chinese nation, including our compatriots in Taiwan.\u201d Taiwan, which formally calls itself the \u2018Republic of China\u2019, broke off from the mainland in 1949 after the victory of communist forces in the Chinese Civil War. Beijing and Taipei spent the next several decades bickering over which of them has is the one true China. The United Nations formally recognized the PRC as such in 1971, with the United States moving to recognize the People\u2019s Republic in 1979, while maintaining a close partnership with Taiwan. In the 1980s and 1990s, Taiwan\u2019s longtime ruling party \u2013 the nationalist Kuomintang \u2013 the same political force that fought the communists during the civil war, worked to improve economic and informal diplomatic links with the PRC. More recently, some of its factions have also expressed support for reunification under the \u2018One Country, Two Systems\u2019 principle. However, the current ruling party \u2013 the Democratic Progressives, is openly hostile to any form of reunification, and has lobbied Washington extensively to shore up diplomatic ties and military assistance.

","content":"The West should supply Turkey with F-35 fighters and Patriot missile systems without preconditions, the head of the Communications Department of the Turkish presidential Administration, Fahrettin Altun, said. He added that any \"informal proposals\" would not help to repair relations.  Earlier this month, Reuters reported, citing its sources, that the US had informally discussed with Turkey the possibility of sending Russian S-400 defence systems to Ukraine to help it in fighting against the Russian army. In response to the report, Altun wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, saying that the idea of Ankara handing over the S-400s it acquired from Russia to Ukraine is unrealistic.  \"Though quite unrealistic today, this idea presents an opportunity to discuss the problems Turkey has experienced lately with the West,\" Altun said. The official also emphasised that before buying S-400s from Russia, Turkey had repeatedly approached the US for the purchase of the Patriot system.  \"Given that Turkey is in one of the world\u2019s most dangerous and unstable regions, and the threats Turkey faced did not magically disappear with Washington\u2019s rejection, Ankara had to look into alternatives...Turkey did not have the choice to buy the Patriot,\" Altun explained. The relations between Turkey and the US became strained several years ago, after Ankara signed a contract with Moscow in 2017 for the supply of Russian-made S-400 air defence systems. Washington then suspended Turkey from its F-35 programme, although Ankara had previously paid for the delivery of the fifth generation fighter jets. The US claimed that Russian S-400s were incompatible with NATO's military hardware and would pose a threat to the bloc. Turkey refused to cancel the contract on S-400s, arguing that it has the right to strengthen its defence in the way it sees necessary. This comes amid continuing attempts by the US to pressure Turkey to impose sanctions against Russia over its special military operation in Ukraine. However, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has repeatedly said that Ankara has no intention to join international sanctions against Russia and is only ready to act as a mediator in negotiations between Moscow and Kiev.

Dubbed the 'Doomsday' plane, it was dispatched by the US Air Force to Europe as part of a fleet of jets supporting President Joe Biden throughout his four-day agenda, including an emergency NATO summit, a G7 summit and a meeting of the European Council in Brussels. Washington and its allies have been developing plans for additional forces and capabilities to prop up defence in Ukraine, where Russia is conducting its special operation to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" the country, launched on 24 February. Moscow took the decision after the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for assistance amid increasing attacks from Kiev forces. The Kremlin has underscored that the goal of its operation is to exclusively target military infrastructure of the country, while having no plans of occupying Ukraine. The E4-B Nightwatch - based on a Boeing 747 \u2013 is outwardly similar to the American presidential aircraft, known as Air Force One. It is part of a fleet of four  jets that first entered service in the 1980s and have been upgraded since their first deployment. Dubbed the \u201cFlying Pentagon\u201d, they are designed to be a command and control centre in the event of nuclear war as they can survive the electromagnetic pulse that is released when a nuclear charge detonates. Furthermore, the jets can maintain contact with US military units across the globe as orders from the POTUS are conveyed to US nuclear submarines and Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos. News of the deployment of Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cDoomsday\u201d plane to Europe comes against the backdrop of reports that his administration has assembled a team of national security officials to draw scenarios for how the US would respond to a chemical, biological, or nuclear weapon attack by Russia during its operation in Ukraine. The New York Times had cited sources within the discussions, claiming a group dubbed \u201cTiger Team\u201d was established in a memo signed by the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, on 28 February, four days after Moscow began the special military operation. While the report claimed that the Tiger Team was tasked with examining what might compel the NATO alliance to deploy military force in Ukraine, Biden himself has openly voiced his opposition to such an eventuality. The US President has emphasized that a direct involvement in ongoing conflict would be \"World War 3.\" Indeed, Russia\u2019s President, Vladimir Putin had ordered that the country\u2019s nuclear forces be placed on heightened alert late last month, citing \"aggressive statements\" by British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss about possible NATO involvement in the Ukraine crisis. Truss had remarked that the crisis in Ukraine \u201ccould end up\u201d being a conflict between the \u201cfreedom and democracy\u201d-loving nations of the Western alliance and Russia. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan made mention of that, ahead of Joe Biden\u2019s trip to Europe, saying that the White House would discuss potential use of nuclear weapons with allies and partners in the context of the developments in Ukraine. In response to the West\u2019s talk of Russia\u2019s potential use of nuclear weapons, Moscow has clarified that only if it determined its existence as a nation was threatened would it resort to such a scenario. \"We have a concept of domestic security, it's public, you can read all the reasons for [Russia's] nuclear arms to be used. If it is an existential threat for our country, then it can be used in accordance with our concept,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN in an interview.

Naumova recalls her time at the US Arnold Classic championship in 2015, when she won and met Schwarzenegger, whom she called her \"idol\". She said she handed him letters from children in Donbass that the kids gave her when she was visiting the region on a humanitarian sports mission. At the time, according the powerlifting champion, Schwarzenegger said that he would \"work on\" the letters, before handing the envelope to his assistant. The athlete drew Schwarzenegger's attention to a gloomy memorial in Donetsk known as the Alley of Angels, established in memory of children \"killed by bullets and bombs of the Ukrainian army\". Her response comes days after the former California governor released his own message addressed to the Russian people. In a nine-minute-long video posted on his social media, Schwarzenegger assured Russians that he \"loves\" them and told viewers about his own Russian icon, powerlifting champion Yuri Vlasov.  The \"Terminator\" star said he wanted to spread the \"truth\" about the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine, which he described as an \"illegal war\" that he believed was not launched in the name of the Russian people. He then recalled the Nazi past of his father, who \"did not like Russians\" after his experience during World War II. Drawing a parallel between his father's time in the Nazi army and Russian soldiers, Schwarzenegger addressed the latter, noting that his father was traumatised by war wounds and a sense of guilt. The military operation in Ukraine, which has been ongoing for over 20 days, was launched by the Kremlin in late February with the goal to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" the neighbouring country. Moscow said it had no plans to occupy Ukraine or harm civilians, underlining that Russian troops only target military infrastructure. Western countries, however, have condemned the military operation and called it an invasion, imposing a slew of harsh anti-Russian sanctions that have targeted the Russian economy, media, culture, sports, and many other spheres.

Despite the incumbent President still enjoying a margin of victory over the head of the right-wing National Rally party, Macron would win by just 53 percent versus 47 percent for Le Pen, if the two were to face off in the second round, shows a poll by the Ifop-Fiducial group published on 29 March. In a similar positioning, a poll by Ipsos Sopra-Steria showed Macron winning by 56 percent to 44 percent against le Pen. The shift in momentum was dismissed by the French president\u2019s aides as no more than a mere correction after an initial surge in support for Macron over his stance on the Ukraine developments.  Nevertheless, Le Pen and her National Rally party have received the boost in support cited by polls as between a quarter and a third of voters reportedly remain undecided on who to cast their ballots for. \u201cI have never been so close to victory,\u201d Le Pen, who has been focusing on domestic issues such as inflation and cost of living during her campaign, told Le Parisien newspaper in an interview published Saturday. Marine Le Pen has also weighed in on the developments in Ukraine, where Russia has been conducting a special operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify the country. Denouncing arms supplies to Kiev by the West as verging on participation in the ongoing conflict, Le Pen also told BFM TV that a war with Russia would be of \"high intensity\", and she would not want France to take part in such a war. \"The best way to help Ukrainians is to achieve peace\", she stressed. Furthermore, the anti-Russian sanctions that Western countries have slapped on Moscow would make the French people \"the first victims,\" according to Le Pen, particularly an embargo on Russian gas and oil. Meanwhile, Emmanuel Macron, 44, has engaged in a flurry of diplomatic meetings prompted by the developments in Ukraine, Last week saw Macron, hoping to be the first French president to win re-election in 20 years, attend NATO, G7 and European summits. His opponents have accused him of using the international developments as a means of dodging the political debate on the home front, failing to step up on such issues as immigration, crime and defending French culture. Slammed by them as a \u201cpresident of the rich,\u201d the former investment banker sought to boost his canvassing at home this week. He ventured out on a public walkabout to meet voters on Monday in the town of Dijon, where he was given an earful by voters, complaining of inflation and rocketing fuel prices \u2013 issues that have all been exacerbated by fallout from the Ukraine crisis. After Russia began a military operation in Ukraine responding to calls for help from the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, which it had earlier formally recognized, the West responded by imposing comprehensive sanctions against Moscow, prompting many foreign companies to suspend operations in the country. The Western sanctions have had a massive impact on food and energy prices and supplies worldwide. Emmanuel Macron, who only officially declared his candidacy earlier this month, 24 hours before a deadline for candidates to finalise their intent to run, when accosted by voters in Dijon responded by saying: A total of 12 candidates succeeded in gathering the 500 endorsements from elected French officials required to enter the presidential race, with the top two in the first round facing off in a second-round run-off on April 24.

","content":"The current Russophobia in the West is a verdict on Western civilisation, Russian Foreign Minister Segey Lavrov said in his address to students at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.  Speaking about the priorities of Russian foreign policy in view of the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, Lavrov said that the prompt conclusion of Russia-Ukraine negotiations is not beneficial for the United States. According to him, Washington wants hostilities between Russia and Ukraine to continue as long as possible. He stressed that Russia is not against Western mediation in talks with Ukraine but there are certainly some red lines that should not be crossed.   When asked about the possibility of peacekeepers being deployed to Ukraine, the minister said that this could lead to a clash between Russian and NATO forces. Commenting on the unprecedented sanctions imposed by the West on Russia after the beginning of the operation in Ukraine, Lavrov said these restrictions are aimed at removing Russia as an obstacle to a unipolar world. According to the minister, the freezing of the Russian central bank's reserves by the West is 'just theft'.  Going back to the major goals of the Russian special operation in Ukraine, Lavrov said that concerns Moscow had about Kiev preparing an offensive in the Donbass region have proved reasonable. Moscow will demand that Ukraine cancel legislation directed against the Russian-speaking population of the country, the Russian Foreign Minister added. He noted that under the presidency of Volodymyr Zelensky, all attempts to re-introduce Russian as a second official language in regions where it is spoken were shot down by lawmakers.

The Turkish president was referring to a Wall Street Journal op-ed penned by Fahrettin Altun, the head of the Communications Department  of the Turkish presidential Administration, who reckoned that the idea of handing over the air defence systems Ankara purchased from Russia to Ukraine was \"unrealistic\". Instead, Altun argued that the West should supply Turkey with F-35 fighter jets and Patriot missile systems without preconditions to help mend ties. Aside from clarifying his stance on the S-400 idea, Erdogan told reporters that he was planning to talk to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, at the end of the week in order to discuss the outcome of the NATO summit in Brussels held this week. The Turkish president made it clear that Ankara will not be joining its NATO allies in imposing sanctions against Moscow, especially when it comes to the energy needs. \"We are also evaluating certain UN lines in terms of sanctions, but let's not forget that we cannot put aside our relations with Russia,\" the Turkish leader told reporters on the plane upon his return from Brussels. \"There are discussions about carrying out transactions in rubles, that is, in their own national currency. We have already proposed this to Russia, we have said that it is possible to do this in rubles and Turkish lira. Now we are completely proven right, and they say that they can do it,\" Hurriyet quoted Erdogan as saying on Friday. Last week, Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said that even though Turkey understood the position of its allies regarding Russia, Ankara believed it should maintain an open line of communication with Moscow. On 23 March, President Vladimir Putin said that Russia will be transferring payments for gas supplies to \"unfriendly countries\" into rubles, pointing out that it makes no sense to supply Russian goods to the EU and the US and receive payment in their currency. Putin instructed the Central Bank and the Cabinet of Ministers to determine the procedure for transactions with Europe in rubles within a week. At the same time, he said that Russia would continue to supply gas in volumes and at prices fixed in earlier contracts, as the country values its reputation. A number of Western countries introduced several batches of sanctions against Russia over its military operation in Ukraine. Even though Moscow admitted that the sanctions are quite crippling, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed that Russia had been preparing for them in advance. President Putin said that the policy of containing and weakening Russia is a long-term strategy of the West, and sanctions have dealt a serious blow to the entire global economy. Putin also said that the United States and the European Union had effectively defaulted on their obligations to Russia, freezing its foreign exchange reserves. He added that current events draw a line under the global dominance of the West in both politics and economics. Russia launched a special military operation to demilitarise and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine on 24 February in order to protect the Donbass population. Putin stressed that he made the tough decision after the newly recognised Donetsk and Lugansk republics appealed for help.

The two sides were also said to have discussed the implementation of the programme for expanded cooperation set by President Putin and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi during the latter's visit to Moscow in January. Lavrov and Abdollahian met on the sidelines of an upcoming conference of senior officials from Russia, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan chaired by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to discuss the security and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan in the aftermath of the US withdrawal last August. Diplomats from Indonesia and Qatar are also expected to attend. Asking Lavrov to convey President Raisi's \"warm greetings\" to Putin, Abdollahian said that \"bileteral relations between Russia and Iran are on the right track and developing.\" \"I was informed that positive steps are planned in the course of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine,\" the Iranian foreign minister added. Moscow considers sanctions an instrument of Western policy aimed at \"undermining the principle of the sovereign equality of states,\" and an attempt to \"revise\" the UN Charter, Lavrov added. Russia rocketed past Iran to become the world's most heavily-sanctioned nation in recent weeks, with a total of over 5,200 sanctions placed on Moscow to date, compared with 3,600 for the Islamic Republic, according to sanctions tracking service Castellum.ai. The sanctions have trapped some $300 billion in Russian foreign exchange reserves abroad, and left Russian businesses scrambling to find alternatives to Western-sourced machinery and equipment, spare parts, services, and consumer goods. Iran has faced varying degrees of sanctions pressure since the Revolution of 1979, but instead of allowing the restrictions to drag it down, has used them to its advantage to become the largest industrial power in the Middle East, and to develop a host of economic sectors ranging from defence electronics to aerospace from scratch.

Tod Wolters, commander of US European Command. Wolters acknowledged this at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, sharing his \"suspicion\u201d of a need for a bulked-up US military presence, while declining to specify whether that would mean permanent basing. Wolters was responding to a question from Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who asked whether the United States ought to station more troops permanently in Europe, particularly in the Baltics, instead of the current practice of employing rotating forces. Under the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation, signed in Paris, France, in 1997, the alliance would not undertake any \u201cadditional permanent stationing of substantial combat forces\u201d in the east of Europe, well as from placing nuclear weapons in the region. However, in recent months, amid Russia\u2019s operation in Ukraine,  started after the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for help due to increasing attacks from Kiev forces, US military forces under Wolters' command have grown from about 60,000 to 102,000 as of Tuesday, confirmed the general. On 28 March, the Pentagon announced the deployment of six Navy EA-18G Growlers electronic attack aircraft, accompanied by about 240 troops, to Germany. This comes as earlier this year an armored brigade of the 1st Infantry Division, totaling about 4,000 soldiers, was sent to Germany, a similar-size infantry brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division was dispatched to Poland. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also sent F-35A fifth-generation stealth fighter jets to bolster NATO\u2019s \u201cEastern Flank\u201d and as many as twenty Apache attack helicopters to the Baltic States. All of these reinforcements have been billed as temporary, with American military and administration officials assuring that no US troops would enter Ukraine. When recent remarks by US President Joe Biden in Poland were interpreted by many as a hint at a potential deployment of US forces to Ukraine, Gen. Tod Wolters was forced to deny some of the dubious claims made by the POTUS. Thus, at Tuesday\u2019s US Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Wolters dismissed claims that Americans are training Ukrainian troops in Poland. \"I do not believe that we are in the process of currently training military forces from Ukraine in Poland\", stated the European Command (EUCOM) head. He confirmed there are \"liaisons that are there\", and \"they're being given advice, and that\u2019s different\". Currently, there are over 10,000 American troops stationed in Poland. Wolters' comments followed President Biden's remarks in Poland on Monday, when POTUS responded to a reporter's question about his comments, made when meeting paratroopers from the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division last week in Poland. At the time, in an apparent gaffe, Biden had implied that US forces would be going to Ukraine. At Monday's press conference, in an attempt to double back, the American President denied he had meant that, saying that he was \"referring to being with, and talking with, the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland\". US troop deployments to Eastern Europe come as earlier in the month, during a testimony before a House committee just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of the special military operation in Ukraine, a senior official who oversaw the 2021 Pentagon review of its worldwide military presence warned it needed to be reconsidered. Mara Karlin had stated on 1 March that the Pentagon must \u201censure that we've got deterrence of Russia and that we can absolutely 150% say that NATO is safe and secure,\u201d not only in connection with the developments in Ukraine, but \u201cfor the longer term.\u201d Let's stay in touch no matter what!

The statement came amid the ongoing Russian special military operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine.","content":"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made it clear that China should get off the political fence and condemn Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine. According to Johnson, \"there are considerable dilemmas now for people who thought they could sit this one out, who thought they could sit on the fence\". Referring to the neutral stance adopted by China following the beginning of Russia's special operation in Ukraine, the PM said that he believes \"in Beijing you are starting to see some second thoughts\" on the matter. The remarks followed Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian responding to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's warning that Beijing will face consequences for supporting the Russian operation in Ukraine. He added that some in the US continue to spread false information and slander, trying to pressure China, something that Zhao said is extremely irresponsible behaviour that does not help resolve the Ukraine crisis. This came after the Chinese diplomat emphasised earlier this week that Beijing will continue to pursue normal trade and economic cooperation with Moscow based on mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit. He also said that Beijing calls on Washington to avoid damaging China's interests when trying to settle its relations with Russia.  Additionally, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that \"Beijing discourages the use of sanctions to settle problems and even more opposes unilateral sanctions that lack international legal grounds\". The comments were preceded by US State Department spokesman Ned Price raising concerns over alleged attempts by China to use the Ukrainian crisis \"to advance Beijing's long-term interest in its competition with the United States\". He also warned Beijing that any support extended to Russia, including \"helping to avert sanctions imposed by the US and its allies, would have implications not only for China's relations with the United States, but for its relationships around the world\". The developments unfold against the backdrop of the ongoing Russian special operation in Ukraine announced by President Vladimir Putin on 24 February to demilitarise and de-Nazify the country. The operation was launched after the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) asked for assistance to defend themselves from intensifying attacks by Ukrainian troops. Putin stressed that Russia is not seeking to occupy Ukraine, while the Russian Defence Ministry underscored that the goal of the operation is to neutralise Ukraine's military capacity with high-precision weapon strikes, which do not pose a threat to the civilian population. In response, the United States, Britain, and the European Union, as well as several other countries, introduced packages of sanctions targeting Russian entities and individuals. Moscow then retaliated with personal sanctions of its own, directed at top US government officials, including President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, as well as Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, who have been added to Russia's own \"stop list\".

The UN has called to thoroughly investigate such incidents in Ukraine.","content":"Russian President Vladimir Putin called German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's attention to rocket strikes by the Ukrainian military of the cities of Donetsk and Makeevka during a Friday telephone call, the Kremlin press service has stated. The president stressed that these strikes amount to \"war crimes\", but were still completely ignored by the West. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also addressed recent claims by US President Biden, who called Putin a \"murderous dictator\", a \"pure thug\", and a \"war criminal\" in his latest speeches, saying that his statements had already turned into daily insults. Peskov added that such statements should be unacceptable for a president of a country that has killed hundreds of thousands around the world with its bombs. Russia and Ukraine mutually accuse each other's military of attacking civilian objects. The Kremlin has repeatedly guaranteed that Russian forces are only conducting strikes against military objects. The Ukrainian armed forces and nationalist battalions have been carrying out occasional attacks against the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) ever since they declared independence following the West-backed coup in Kiev in 2014. The latest major strike came on 14 March, when a Tochka-U (NATO reporting name is SS-21 Scarab) missile hit the centre of Donetsk, killing 20 and injuring 35 more. The DPR authorities claim that the missile was armed with forbidden cluster munition. The Russian envoy to the UN slammed the strike as a terrorist attack and a war crime. In his conversation with Olaf Scholz, Putin touched upon the ongoing Russia-Ukraine talks, saying that Kiev is trying to drag out the negotiations by making more and more unrealistic proposals. He added that Russia nonetheless continues to search for solutions to negotiate a deal to end the hostilities. Peskov said that the text of an agreement is yet to be negotiated and added that the Russian delegation is ready to work at a faster pace. He expressed regret that the Ukrainian side does not show a similar intent. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Last week, the Russian military estimated that about 6,600 foreign \u201cmercenaries and terrorists\u201d remain active in Ukraine, and that their ranks are dwindling.","content":"Henry Hoeft, the 28-year-old US Army veteran who garnered significant media attention following the release of a viral video detailing his escape from Ukraine after being left without weapons and threatened with execution, has provided new information on his experiences, including possible war crimes carried out by Ukrainian forces and the so-called Georgian Legion, the group of fighters he joined. Speaking to The Grayzone and providing access to a recent interview he did with British media, Hoeft said he joined the infamous Georgian Legion instead of the better-known Ukrainian Foreign Legion because the latter required a contract. Hoeft recalled witnessing how two apparent civilians attempting to pass through a Ukrainian checkpoint, only to be \u201cblackbagged,\u201d taken to a building to have their throats cut. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if they were actually spies or just people who ran through a checkpoint,\u201d he said. Hoeft, who has faced attacks from the Ukrainian government painting him as a Russian stooge, and story after-sarcastically-titled story from Rolling Stone, the Daily Mail and New York Magazine painting him as a coward, stood by sentiments he expressed in his viral video, including about the danger of being shot in the back by your own side. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as glory in death. You\u2019re going to die in a trench and you\u2019re going to get left there and it\u2019s gross and it\u2019s bad,\u201d Hoeft said. The volunteer said he and his friends decided that they would not go to Kiev unless they were armed first. \u201cYou can be ambushed on your way to Kiev [and] that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. Hoeft speculated on why the foreign volunteers were not properly equipped, saying most of the hundreds of millions of dollars in Western equipment that has been sent to Kiev probably ended up in the hands of the Ukrainian army. \u201cThey want to keep the casualties of their people to a minimum. So if you have a bunch of foreigners that come to volunteer, send them first.\u201d The American also recalled an incident of a Ukrainian soldier informing him and his comrades that the Georgians were upset at the group\u2019s refusal to go to Kiev without proper weapons, and warning that the Legion\u2019s fighters were \u201cthreatening to shoot you in the back.\u201d He said he and his group ultimately decided to leave Ukraine and cross back into Poland after being told that the legion planned to have them executed and marked down as combat casualties. On their way back, Hoeft\u2019s group met British fighters who said volunteers in combat gear were being sent back from the border area after having their passports confiscated. Hoeft gave a warning to any Americans, including combat veterans from conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan, to stay home, saying the situation in Ukraine was unlike anything the US has seen since Vietnam, and possibly worse. Russian airstrikes against training camps hosting volunteers and the testimony of people like Hoeft and other Westerners have reportedly led to a thinning out of the numbers of foreigners seeking to \u2018fight Russia\u2019 in Ukraine. Last week, Russian General Staff Main Operational Directorate chief Sergei Rudskoy said in a briefing that Russia had picked up on the presence of 6,595 foreign \"mercenaries and terrorists\" from 62 countries operating in Ukraine. Pointing to their dwindling numbers, particularly after the missile strike on the Yavoriv training base on 13 March, Rudskoy warned that the rules of warfare do not apply to mercenaries.

The lawsuit says that \"acting in concert, the defendants maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that their Republican opponent Donald J. Trump was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty.\"","content":"\"The timing seems wise as the lawsuit begins while Americans remain engaged considering events rather than during the summer when many are more interested in trying to enjoy time off from working. Now through November 2022, we will have plenty of time to evaluate claims and counterclaims, assuming the judge (a Bill Clinton nominee) does not dismiss Trump's lawsuit,\" says Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst and investigative journalist. The ex-president's lawsuit is targeting Clinton, her 2016 presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee, DNC-linked law firm Perkins Coie, former Clinton campaign lawyers Michael Sussmann and Marc Elias, Biden National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, ex-Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, ex-MI6 agent Christopher Steele, former FBI Director James Comey and other prominent political and intelligence figures. According to Fox News, Trump's legal team is suing for \"tens of millions of dollars in attorneys' fees, damages exceeding $100 million, and 'for our democracy'\". The former president's legal action comes amid Special Counsel John Durham probe into the origins of the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation codenamed Crossfire Hurricane. Still, Trump is not inclined to wait until the special counsel wraps his inquiry up. \"The Trump brand has been damaged monetarily, so Donald Trump is taking necessary steps in this civil suit to gain a measure of redress,\" says Ortel. \"No doubt he will amend the suit, if it is not dismissed to add in relevant developments as Durham advances his investigations and prosecutions.\" The Wall Street analyst forecasts that Durham has purview over criminal matters and, if he follows leads back into their true history, \"he will have to take on many former presidents and their Deep State allies.\" According to the Associated Press, Trump's lawsuit appears to be part of a \"longtime legal strategy.\" The news outlet notes that Trump has mastered himself over decades in \"repurposing political and personal grievances into causes of legal action.\" Speaking to Newsmax, Trump attorney Alina Habba announced that more lawsuits are coming. \"We have another suit being filed shortly,\" Habba said. \"And anybody that\u2019s going to try and make up malicious stories about him while he was sitting as president, prior to his presidency or now is going to be sued.\" The US mainstream media is expected to be trying to silence and ridicule Trump's effort, suggests Ortel. Following Trump's announcement of going after Hillary Clinton and her team, Hillary's spokesperson Nick Merrill stated that the former president's initiative is \"nonsense.\" Nevertheless, they will have to respond to it, according to the analyst. If Trump's lawsuit isn't dismissed, it may amplify the ongoing internal political struggle within the Democratic Party, according to the Wall Street analyst. Trump's move comes as rumours of Hillary and Bill Clinton's political comeback is circulated by the press as the Biden-Harris administration poll numbers are continuing to plummet. \"What may be happening is a war to decide who will lead the Democrat Party \u2013 in this conflict Team Obama likely wants Team Biden and Team Clinton gone from relevance,\" suggests Ortel. \"So, it may be that the Swamp will cooperate in a restoration and deification of the Obama brand by piling on Clinton, Biden and Bush corruption.\" To complicate matters even further, the New York Post and the Daily Mail have gone ballistic on Joe Biden's son, Hunter, by saying that the latter was involved in funding controversial Ukrainian bio-laboratories which studied dangerous pathogens, including those that could be used in biological warfare. The bombshells were dropped after Jack Maxey, a political activist and former Steve Bannon podcast co-host, stated that he would make \"laptop from hell\" files public. The content of the laptop, which was reportedly abandoned by Hunter Biden in a Delaware repair shop, was verified by The New York Times, 17 months after the story was broken by The New York Post. According to Ortel, Hunter's laptop revelations have triggered further suspicions about the Democratic establishment's conduct between 2016 and 2020, when Donald Trump had been smeared, attacked and impeached by the Dems.

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has already arrived in Israel to take part in a historic two-day summit. The foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Bahrain, and Morocco are expected in the country later today. A source in the Gulf familiar with the matter told Sputnik that the summit will focus on a number of regional issues. One of them is Syria and the readmission of the country into the fold of Arab states.  Others are the war in Ukraine and the bolstering of military cooperation between Israel and other participants of the summit.  Yet, the source reiterated that the most important issues to be addressed are the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iran's nuclear programme. Recent reports have suggested that Tehran is close to inking a deal regarding its nuclear progremme with the US and other Western powers. According to that agreement, if it comes to fruition, Iran would commit to stall its nuclear ambitions in exchange for Washington lifting most of its sanctions. The Islamic Republic is also demanding that the White House remove Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of the Iranian military, from the list of terror organisations, a move that Washington is seriously considering.  Tamam Busafi, a Manama-based political analyst, says that this development has leaders in Israel, Egypt, Morocco, and the Gulf worried. Iran has been challenging Israel, Egypt, Morocco, and the Gulf for years. Aside from working on its nuclear programme - which many in the region believe will be directed against Israel and the Gulf - Iran has also funded a number of its allies, such as Lebanon's Shiite militia Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have staged multiple attacks against Saudi and Emirati targets. It is believed that Tehran has been actively stirring up anti-government sentiments in Bahrain and that it is working on triggering unrest in Western Sahara over which Morocco claims ownership. It is for these reasons, says Busafi, that regional leaders are meeting in Israel to show that they are forming a joint front and that they no longer rely on America to provide them with security. Israel and its neighbours have already taken a number of steps in that direction. The Jewish state and Egypt have boosted security cooperation. The country's top military brass have visited the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco to coordinate actions, deals have been signed, and equipment has been delivered. The source in the Gulf suggests that these developments are a cause for concern in Washington, especially as the US has played a pivotal role in the establishment of ties between Israel and the four Muslim states whose ministers will be present at the summit. And this is why, they insist on Blinken's arrival so that \"things don't get out of hand\". Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Oil and gas companies are also obligated to use what they have, the president said, pointing to 9,000 unused but approved production permits for federal lands, amounting to more than a million unused acres that US oil and gas companies supposedly have the right to exploit.\u00a0If they don\u2019t use the land, Biden suggested, they should pay up. \u201cFor US oil companies that are recording their largest profits in years, they can put those profits to productive use by producing more [\u2026] restarting idle wells, or producing on the sites they are already leasing.\u201d American families, the president said, \u201ccan\u2019t afford to let oil companies sit on their hands.\u201dWhat they shouldn\u2019t be doing, he argued, is shipping those profits to investors \u2013 $80 billion in the last year alone, he claimed, and likely to increase in 2022. While insisting he was a \u201ccapitalist,\u201d Biden chided oil companies for cashing in over \u201cPutin\u2019s price hike\u201d while Americans struggled to put food on the table.\u201cI have no problem with corporations turning a good profit,\u201d Biden insisted, but \u201cinvesting those profits in production and innovation, that\u2019s what they should do. Invest in your customers. It\u2019s not [just] the patriotic view; it\u2019s good for your business as well.\u201dBiden eventually acknowledged that getting oil production restarted took time, but promised to release one million barrels per day from the nation\u2019s strategic oil reserves over the next six months, amounting to 180 million barrels, as a stopgap measure.This bounty would be temporary, Biden warned, stating that ultimately the US and the rest of the world would have to wean itself off fossil fuels and speed the transition to a \u201cclean energy future that\u2019s made in America with American products and American values.\u201d To get that project off the ground, the president announced he would be using the Defense Production Act to secure an American supply chain for electric vehicle batteries and the minerals needed to make them: lithium, graphite, nickel, and other elements that are scarce in the US but abundant in countries like Russia and China.Biden, troublingly, did not explain how specifically the Defense Production Act would secure a supply chain for these minerals, and suggested that the country would be involved in spreading the gospel of green energy, exporting those technologies around the world.He admitted his ideas had come from America\u2019s 11 largest utility companies, whose CEOs visited him earlier in the month, but insisted they had told him energy savings would show up in families\u2019 bills immediately and promised a $6,500 per home payment for families to weatherize their homes.As for the reasons behind the US\u2019 fuel problems in the first place, Biden blamed first the Covid-19 pandemic for sending the demand for oil plummeting, then the \u201cstrength and speed of our recovery\u201d for sending it soaring skyward once again. He ultimately settled on Russian President Vladimir Putin as the real source of Americans\u2019 troubles and the reason why gas rose over a dollar per gallon in many cities as soon as the first Russian soldier set foot in Ukraine.\u201cOur family budgets, your family budgets, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war,\u201d Biden lamented. While the US gets less than 3% of its oil from Moscow, Biden has repeatedly linked the spike in fuel prices directly to his embargo on Russian oil and gas, eager to be seen as the one dealing out punishment to Russia.Biden also promised he would not be dissuaded from his plan, revealing he was \u201copen to deals to strengthen the plan but I will not be put off.\u201d He would do whatever was necessary \u201cto protect you from Putin\u2019s price hike,\u201d Biden said, declaring \u201cAmericans can\u2019t afford [politics] right now,\u201d but that \u201cwe\u2019re the only nation that has turned every crisis we\u2019ve ever faced into an opportunity.\u201d"},{"uuid":"9839b934-1e16-4938-8722-732ce6e3338e","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/sport\/552893-cristiano-ronaldo-boss-international-future\/","title":"Ronaldo makes \u2018boss\u2019 claim before crunch World Cup clash","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6242f28c2030277793460a23.jpg","subtitle":"Cristiano Ronaldo has angrily rejected suggestions that he might call time on his international career","content":"Portuguese ace Cristiano Ronaldo, 37, says that he won't be pushed into making a statement about his international future and insists that he is the \u201cboss\u201d of his own\u00a0career amid speculation that this year's World Cup in Qatar will be his final appearance on the global international stage.Portugal face a do-or-die qualification match with North Macedonia on Tuesday evening, a fixture which has prompted speculation that the game could be Ronaldo's international swansong if the North Macedonians are able to repeat their surprise playoff semifinal win against European champions Italy last week.\u00a0And faced with a barrage of questions about when he might decide to call time on his international career, Ronaldo fired back at the media to say that that is a decision for him to make\u00a0\u2013 and it won't be influenced by media gossip.\u201cI\u2019m beginning to see that many of you ask the same question,\u201d a tetchy Ronaldo said.\u201cWho will decide my future is me, nobody else.

I have always decided my life and that is what I will continue to do.\u201dA post shared by Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano)Ronaldo, who captains the Portuguese national team, has had an exemplary international career.Last year he became the all-time record goalscorer in men's international football when he scored two late headed goals in a 2-1 home win against the Republic of Ireland in the World Cup qualification campaign.His record currently stands at 115 goals in 185 appearances for his country.And ahead of what would, on the surface at least, appear to be Ronaldo's final opportunity to win a World Cup, the Manchester United star has called on Portuguese fans to step up ahead of the match with North Macedonia.\u201cI urge the fans\u00a0\u2013 I want hell breaking loose at Dragao [Stadium],\u201d Ronaldo said.\u201cI went to bed last night thinking that I want the stadium to shut down the music for our national anthem and let the fans sing it acapella to show our passion, our strength and union around the objective of reaching the World Cup.\u201cFor us, this game is a matter of life and death. There is a responsibility to win this game. For us, also a game of our lives.

Lauber is also under investigation.The FIFA chief is reportedly suspected of seeking information on investigations\u00a0about\u00a0FIFA and\u00a0former executives at the organizations, potentially\u00a0with the intention\u00a0of influencing the course of those cases.Match said that a \"softer\" decision on Russia's membership could increase Infantino's risk of receiving tougher measures from the Swiss justice system because the state has an \"anti-Russian political agenda.\"No Russian representatives are said to have been accredited for the Congress.\u00a0Alexei Sorokin, the\u00a0former general director of the organizing committee for the 2018 World Cup, and\u00a0a group of Russian specialists related to that tournament are reportedly in Qatar.Local dignitary Alexey Sorokin told the outlet on Monday that he saw no grounds for a temporary or permanent removal of Russia's FIFA membership.Sorokin\u00a0said that the RFU needed to communicate with international federations and build relationships, adding that he expected UEFA to compensate Russia over the relocation of the Champions League final in May from St. Petersburg to Paris.Karpin spoke on Monday of his hope that Russia would return to the international football arena soon.\"The situation is changing every day,\"\u00a0the former international said of the playoffs, in which Poland \u2013 who were given a bye \u2013 will play Sweden on Tuesday in the final that could have featured Russia."},{"uuid":"98b48f20-fa18-464e-812a-0d230698526f","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220329\/met-police-may-issue-first-set-of-fines-as-part-of-its-probe-into-covid-rule-busting-no-10-parties-1094280169.html","title":"Met Police May Issue First Set of Fines as Part of Its Probe Into COVID Rule-Busting No 10 Parties","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e6\/03\/05\/1093606991_0:0:3072:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_891d69dd9e71e0a8be11f9d7433b9a51.jpg?source-sid=ap_photo","subtitle":"In late January, the Metropolitan Police announced a criminal probe into allegations of parties on Downing Street during COVID lockdowns between 2020 and 2021. The investigation came after Scotland Yard received evidence from a separate inquiry on the alleged parties conducted by senior civil servant Sue Gray.","content":"London's Metropolitan Police (Met) is due to issue the first tranche of fixed penalty notices (FPNs) to government officials as part of its probe into purported lockdown-breaking Downing Street parties, The Guardian has cited unnamed sources as saying. The claims come after the Met said last week that Scotland Yard detectives involved in the case had begun to interview people as witnesses, and that it would proceed with the investigation as \"quickly as possible\". Senior Tory MPs previously called on the Met to wrap up their \"partygate\" probe as soon as possible, which they said would allow Prime Minister Boris Johnson to focus on issues pertaining to London's response to the ongoing Russian military operation in Ukraine. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, for his part, said that \"if the PM has made his declaration, unless they've got evidence he's lied, they should clear him\". Smith was apparently referring to the prime minister claiming in January that he thought a \"bring your own booze\" party at 10 Downing Street he attended was a \"work event\". The Met probe has already seen more than 50 Downing Street insiders contacted over their alleged involvement in the \"partygate\" scandal after Scotland Yard sent legal questionnaires to individuals at Number 10 over their purported participation in alleged rule-busting events. The Scotland Yard investigation followed the publication in late February of the initial findings of senior civil servant Sue Gray's report on the \"partygate\" allegations. The document pointed out that there were \"failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office\" and that \"some of the events should not have been allowed to take place\". The release of Gray's report saw Johnson apologising and reshuffling his senior staff, but making it clear that he intends to \"get on\" with his job. In a separate development in February, UK media outlets claimed that more than 100 Conservative MPs will be ready to turn against Johnson if a no-confidence vote against him is triggered. It takes 54 letters of no confidence from Conservative MPs to trigger such a vote. Between 30 and 45 lawmakers are understood to have already sent letters to the chair of the Conservatives' 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

British newspaper The Sun on Sunday reported he had returned to the UK via Poland after contacting senior officers from Ukraine. \u201cHe was in touch with his chain of command, who told him that he had to return,\" the source added. \u201cHe knew he would be in trouble but was also told in no uncertain terms that it would be worse the longer he stayed out there.\u201d The squaddie was taken in for questioning by military police on arrival, but was not detained and has been allowed to go home to his family in the north of England. But the Sun reported that he is now likely to face a court-martial trial. UK Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin recently warned it is \u201cunlawful\u201d for serving troops to go and fight in another country's army. The Sun also claimed the chiefs of staff are worried that if British soldiers are taken prisoner, Russia could claim the UK is intervening directly in the conflict. But early in the conflict Foreign Secretary Liz Truss encouraged Brits to go and fight against the Russian \"de-Nazification\" campaign in Ukraine.  But it also emerged that the young soldier had been one of some 1,000 foreign recruits at the NATO-built training training camp at Yavorov, 12 miles from the Polish border, that was destroyed in a Russian long-range missile strike last week. Kiev admitted to only 35 Ukrainian troops killed in the attack, but the Russian Ministry of Defence claims 180 \"foreign mercenaries\" died \u2014 and some informal sources say the toll has since risen higher. A British ex-serviceman who also joined the Ukrainian foreign legion said he met the teenage soldier at Yavorov. \"The Coldstream Guard was very open about the fact he was still serving,\" he said. \u201cHe said he had been to the Falklands for six months, but was bored in the UK and wanted to see some action and use his training.\" \"At first, he had no intention of returning to the UK but people told him he should and that he was in trouble as going AWOL is a serious offence,\" the older volunteer related. \"I don\u2019t know if he told them he was leaving, but I think he had help from people over there to travel back over the Polish border. Myself and other British people told him he should return, so in the end he has obviously listened.\" Several former British servicemen are known to have signed up to fight in Ukraine \u2014 for wages of just 7,000 hryvnia (\u00a3180) per month \u2014 including Ben Grant, a former Royal Marine and son of Conservative MP for Maidstone and The Weald Helen Grant.

Putin ordered Russia's nuclear forces to be placed on heightened alert late last month, citing \"aggressive statements\" by British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss about possible NATO involvement in the Ukraine crisis. On 1 March, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called on the US to remove its nuclear weapons from Europe and dismantle associated infrastructure. Commenting on Biden's upcoming Europe trip, Sullivan said the president won't be seeking to pressure Washington's allies to immediately ban Russian energy supplies, but that he does plan to announce a \"joint response\" aimed at reducing Europe's dependence on Moscow. The US and its allies will also \"have the opportunity to coordinate on the next phase of military assistance to Ukraine,\" and will be imposing \"further sanctions on Russia, and tightening the existing sanctions to crack down on evasion and ensure robust enforcement,\" he added. Commenting on Biden's announcement earlier this month on the near total ban on Russian energy imports into the US, Sullivan said the president has made clear that he was \"not going to pressure\" allies to follow suit. \"From his perspective, what we have achieved with our European partners in terms of financial sanctions, export controls and other measures to hit the Russian economy hard have had unprecedented impact on a large economy on a scale we have never seen before.\" Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine on 24 February which Putin said was aimed at \"demilitarising\" the country and ridding it of the outsized influence of neo-Nazi elements in the government and armed forces. The operation was started after a request for assistance from the Donbass republics, which faced weeks of escalated shelling, sabotage and sniper attacks by the Ukrainian military before being formally recognized as independent states by Russia on 21 February. In March, the Russian Ministry of Defence began presenting evidence of suspected Ukrainian plans to launch a full-scale offensive in the Donbass, and reporting on the presence of a network of Pentagon-funded biological laboratories in the country which US officials and media first denied but later confirmed existed.

Kennedy Journalism Awards, been a Pulitzer Prize finalist, published more than 20 books and have seen my political cartoons and columns appear in hundreds of newspapers and magazines. So why do I have Russian state media as one of my clients?","content":"I\u2019m on Sputnik News\u2019 website\u2014as a freelancer, not on staff\u2014and a frequent guest on its radio feed for the same reason that former New York Times war correspondent Chris Hedges and former MSNBC talk host Ed Schultz appeared on the now-shuttered RT America television network: I\u2019m a leftist. It\u2019s an article of faith that the United States is a conservative country. But 38% of American voters prefer socialism to capitalism. That\u2019s a remarkable figure considering this country\u2019s history of suppressing the Left from the Palmer raids to McCarthyism to the methodical legislative destruction of trade unionism. The American Left is bigger than you may think, and it\u2019s growing. Yet leftist voices\u2014antiwar, anti-capitalist, militantly environmentalist\u2014are nowhere to be found in the mainstream, corporate-owned print, broadcast and online news media outlets consumed by the vast majority of U.S. citizens. It doesn\u2019t matter how entertaining or relevant or smart or funny you are. Communists, socialists, anarchists, left-libertarians, deep-green environmentalists and populist progressives need not apply as opinion columnists, radio or television commentators. There isn\u2019t even space in mainstream media for pundits who align with establishment progressives like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, whose ideas are indistinguishable from old-school liberal Democrats like Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern. Fortunately, some leftists have found a home on RT or Sputnik. Conservative critics have often accused them of being mouthpieces for the Russian government. But that\u2019s not my experience of the Americans I know. They had their own opinions and found a platform where those opinions were welcome. Working for Sputnik puts a target on your back. Even though I\u2019m not on staff, Twitter and Facebook label links to my Sputnik cartoons as Russian state media. And in the current atmosphere of hysteria over the Russia-Ukraine war to which the U.S. isn\u2019t even a party, reactionaries tar me with that 1950s Cold War classic, guilt by association. Just this week, for example, another cartoonist had the nads to call me \u201ca traitor to American ideals and to democracy,\u201d \u201cPutin\u2019s puppet, a Kremlin propagandist, and a useful idiot.\u201d If this were the 18th century, I\u2019d demand satisfaction from the cur. Useful idiot, of course, is an insult popularized by fascists during McCarthyism. It is still used by the extreme right. I\u2019m curious: what would this neoconservative, who was in favor of invading both Afghanistan and Iraq and now wants another stupid war in Ukraine, have people like me do? Sit in silence forever? Apparently, yes. If you\u2019re on the \u201cactual left,\u201d with a worldview influenced by Marxist class analysis rather than identitarianism, no amount of talent or popularity will get you on the airwaves or into \u201crespectable\u201d print. Until last week, if you were a lucky leftist, you\u2019d be invited to host a show on RT or appear as a guest, where\u2014unlike on CNN, MSNBC or Fox\u2014you\u2019d be treated with respect, asked intelligent questions and given time to answer them. Is it really possible that there are no insightful communist economics experts? No funny socialist editorial cartoonists? No sharp, telegenic, anarcho-syndicalist TV commentators? Of course, such mythical creatures exist\u2014they appeared on RT and, before it was deplatformed by Comcast and DirecTV in 2016, Al Jazeera America. The real reason for the Left\u2019s lack of representation in mainstream media, one suspects, is ideological discrimination. If \u201cdemocracy dies in darkness,\u201d as The Washington Post\u2019s motto reads, why not allow all ideas to be discussed openly? Even cable TV\u2019s most \u201cliberal\u201d channel refuses to air content to the left of the center of the Democratic Party. MSNBC fired left-leaning political talk host Phil Donahue in February 2003, at the peak of the build-up to the invasion of Iraq, even though he had the highest ratings of any program on the network. Bosses blamed production costs. But an internal MSNBC memo worried that Donahue presented a \u201cdifficult public face for NBC in a time of war,\u201d and provided \u201ca home for the liberal antiwar agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity.\u201d \u201cThey were terrified of the antiwar voice,\u201d Donahue recalled. Twelve years later, MSNBC fired feisty pro-worker talker Ed Schultz. He claimed that they fired him for insisting upon covering Bernie Sanders\u2019 2015 campaign launch speech. \u201cYou're not covering Bernie Sanders,\u201d network president Phil Griffin ordered Schultz. RT\u2019s diverse team of commentators wasn\u2019t limited to leftists. The roster included Hedges, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura, \u201cStar Trek\u201d actor William Shatner, ex-CNN host Larry King, leftist comedian Lee Camp and right-wing pundits Dennis Miller and Steve Malzberg. Guests included academic experts, political activists and politicians like former Green Party presidential candidates Ralph Nader and Jill Stein, both of whom were marginalized by U.S. news media and denied spots in presidential debates. The small sliver of American viewers who gave RT a chance encountered excellent production values and high-quality news and opinion programs that didn\u2019t talk down to the audience. RT was unpredictable, entertaining and frequently more engaging than the three major cable news channels. It was nominated for five Emmys. Critics of RT and Sputnik, however, have complained that RT shines a spotlight on schisms in U.S. politics and society, for example, \u201cpush[ing] divisive racial narratives, including stories emphasizing allegations of police abuse in the United States and highlighting racism against African-Americans within the military,\u201d as The New York Times wrote in 2020. Since when, however, is the U.S. or any other government entitled to positive news coverage? If racism makes America look bad, don\u2019t eliminate coverage of racism\u2014eliminate racism. Opponents also deride RT and Sputnik\u2019s news coverage as Russian government propaganda. Which is, of course, objectively subjective. On RT\/Sputnik as on other outlets, bias is largely a matter of omission. In my experience what runs on Sputnik is fact-checked. But it shouldn\u2019t be anyone\u2019s go-to source for criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, any more than you should look to MSNBC for harsh takes on Joe Biden or Fox for sharp attacks on Donald Trump. One could argue, and many on the Left have, that \u201crespectable\u201d American news outlets have frequently worn their biases on their sleeves, and are often accused of disseminating propaganda. The absence of thoughtful antiwar voices when false WMD claims were made during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq and denying coverage to Bernie Sanders come to mind. RT America shut down last week after it was deplatformed by Roku, DirecTV and cable networks. Before it went dark on television, it had earned a sizable online audience. In 2013 the channel became the first to reach 1 billion views on YouTube, numbers driven in part by its willingness to cover third-party candidacies that no one else would touch and round-the-clock reporting on the Occupy Wall Street movement. The leftist Australian blogger Caitlyn Johnstone has frequently remarked that RT America and Sputnik News would have become instantly unviable had left-leaning voices been invited onto mainstream American media outlets.  I agree. When I tell friends that I\u2019m on Sputnik News, an online radio service and news site accessible via the web and therefore less vulnerable to Ukraine-related cancellation in the United States than in Europe, where it is banned, some cock their heads and give that \u201cReally?\u201d expression. Those who check it out are impressed, surprised that the overall tenor of discussion is smarter and sharper than, say, NPR. Sputnik is still operational, with 57 million visits online in the last month. They grant me a platform for my ideas, which are discussed by an appreciative, well-informed audience. They don\u2019t censor me. And they pay. Until the revolution destroys capitalism, leftists must compromise their principles in order to survive. I\u2019ve never been published by a media organization with which I shared all of my political ideals. As a realist with bills to pay, where would I find a media organization with which I share most of my political ideals? I disagree with Sputnik about various issues; I also disagree with NPR and even with Jacobin, the socialist magazine. I would work for pretty much any media outlet that doesn\u2019t constrain my freedom of expression beyond what I consider reasonable limits. (Sputnik has never told me what to say, which is more than I can say for many of my other clients.) But over the past 20 or so years, the media has been turning farther and farther to the right. Left voices, especially before 9\/11, were occasionally allotted space alongside liberal Democrats on the opinion pages. I was one of them. Leftists sometimes appeared on cable news television. Again, I was one of them. So was Rachel Maddow. She survived, and thrived, by moving right into mainstream liberalism. That tiny sliver of openness has vanished. Anti-interventionists rarely if ever\u2014I would say never, but I can\u2019t watch 24-7\u2014appear on those panels of talking heads who discuss foreign policy crises; the acceptable range of discussion runs from pro-interventionist to more pro-interventionist. When is the last time you heard anyone on cable news suggest that the U.S. ought to stay out of an overseas hot spot entirely, that it\u2019s not our business? All the Left needs for a fair shot at readers and viewers is one angel investor. But millionaires tend to dislike socialism. George Soros, b\u00eate noir of the right, funds Democrats, not lefties. This piece was submitted to The New York Times and The Washington Post. Both rejected it. For leftists, Sputnik is still one of the few games in town.

Berlin is under pressure from a number of EU members to introduce such a ban as part of the West's anti-Russian sanctions over Moscow's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. ","content":"Chancellor Olaf Scholz has suggested that Germany stopping imports of Russian coal and oil \"can already happen this year\". The remarks echoed those made by German Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Action Robert Habeck on Saturday, when he said in an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that Berlin plans to become independent of Russian coal by this fall, and almost abandon Russian oil by the end of the year. He stressed that abandoning Russian gas will be harder due to Germany having no capacities for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG). At the same time, the minister asserted that there are no reasons to believe that Russia will stop energy exports, but Berlin is preparing \"for every scenario\". Earlier last week, Habeck told reporters about the need for Germany to diversify energy supplies to abandon Russian imports. According to the German Economy Ministry, the share of Russian oil supplies to the country amounts to 35%, while the share of coal stands at about 50%. He spoke as Chancellor Scholz told German lawmakers last Wednesday that Berlin would end its energy dependence on Moscow in due course but that cutting all ties right now would ride roughed over the German economy. He then referred to a host of sanctions by the US and its allies imposed in response to Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. The latter aims to demilitarise and de\u00ad-Nazify the country and is only targeting its military infrastructure with high\u00ad-precision weapons. As part of the sanctions, the US banned all Russian energy imports. In a separate development on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Moscow will demand that Europe start paying for gas supplies in roubles, as part of Russia's response to the \"severe\" sanctions by the West. \"I have decided to implement a set of measures to transfer payments for our gas supplies to unfriendly countries into Russian roubles\", Putin said, ordering the changes to be implemented within a week. Russia deems all countries that have hit it with sanctions following its special op in Ukraine as \"unfriendly\". The Russian president ordered the start of a special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February following a request from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) to protect them from intensifying attacks by the Ukrainian armed forces. Putin stated that Russia was left with no other choice but to intervene in order to render assistance to the newly-recognised Donbass republics, and that Moscow doesn't plan to occupy Ukraine. Russia's Defence Ministry, for its part, underscored that Ukrainian civilians are out of danger because the operation only targets the country's military infrastructure.

If backed by Congress, the move would downsize the US\u2019 total F-22 fleet from 186 to 153 jets.\u00a0Plans to move the craft to Virginia from Eglin AFB in Florida have been on pause for more than three years, and the air force has stated that the older F-22s currently used for training would simply be too expensive to keep in fighting shape, according to the branch\u2019s deputy assistant budget secretary Major General James Peccia. Those upgrades would cost nearly $2 billion over the next eight years, funds the air force would rather put into newer planes.The remaining F-22s would be stationed at bases in Virginia, Hawaii, Florida and Alaska, air force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said.US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, meanwhile, said he does not foresee any additional F-22 retirements anytime soon, calling the craft the military\u2019s \u201cpremier air-to-air combat platform.\u201dThe effort to save funds for research and development comes as the White House proposes the largest military budget in US history, seeking $813.3 billion over the next year, or $31 billion more than was approved for 2022. The proposal includes $682 million in military aid for Ukraine, as well as a 9.5% boost in R&D funding, putting the total over $130 billion.

The newspaper quoted party officials as saying that the online speech was skipped by Joint List chief Ayman Odeh, followed by two other lawmakers from the alliance's Hadash Party. This came as Communications Minister Yoaz Hendel and several MKs from other parties harshly criticised Zelensky over making comparisons between the Holocaust and Russia's special operation during his Knesset speech, in which he apparently ignored some Ukrainians' complicity in the Nazi-led genocide of Jews. Israeli media outlets also quoted unnamed senior ministers as lashing out at what they dubbed Zelensky's \"outrageous comparison\". The ministers argued that the Ukrainian president \"[\u2026] distorted the part his country played in the murder of Jews\". Likud MK Yuval Steinitz asserted that Zelensky's comparison \"borders on Holocaust denial\". In his speech that was delivered via Zoom, the Ukrainian president also wondered why Kiev cannot \"receive weapons\" from Israel, including its Iron Dome missile defence system, and why the Jewish state \"has not imposed powerful sanctions on Russia or is not putting pressure on Russian business\". The US and its allies imposed packages of tough sanctions on Russia after it launched a special military operation on 24 February to demilitarise and de\u00ad-Nazify Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the operation only aims to destroy Ukrainian military infrastructure with high-precision weapons strikes. On Monday, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov noted that since the beginning of the special operation, 216 unmanned aerial vehicles, 1,506 tanks, and 152 multiple rocket launchers of the Ukrainian Army have already been obliterated.

The diplomat also referred to Soviet-US cooperation during and just after World War II. Young, who called himself a peacemaker, noted the importance of culture in building bridges between countries. On 24 February, Russia began a military operation in Ukraine in response to calls from the Donbass republics for help in countering intensifying attacks by Ukrainian troops. The Russian Defence Ministry said the special operation is targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure only. It accused Kiev's forces of using typical terrorist methods, such as hiding behind civilians and in residential quarters. The US and its allies have responded with comprehensive sanctions, including restrictions on the Russian central bank, export control measures, SWIFT cutoff for select banks, and closure of airspace to all Russian flights.

The former diplomat said that the conflict in Ukraine, which is one of factors behind the high prices, has unified civil society in the US. Young also supposed that the possible replacement of Russian energy sources by oil from Iran and Venezuela might reflect US interests. Last week, the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates for the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and said there could be another six hikes this year if inflation remains high.

According to the newspaper, the White House summoned government lawyers to discussions with the Pentagon regarding what lethal weapons could be delivered to Ukraine without violating international law. However, the legal advice has only provided limited help in easing the White House's headache from solving this task, the newspaper sources added. As a result, the Biden administration faces a \"tangle of decisions, and sometimes tortured distinctions\" as it tries to determine what assistance it can safely offer Kiev, the NY Times said. These deliberations reportedly resulted in the rejection of the no-fly zone idea and the shipments of jet fighters to Ukraine, but gave the green light to supplies of anti-tank weaponry. These limited shipments are being overseen by CIA officers, sources claim. However, the volumes are much smaller than when the spy agency supplied Afghan Mujahedeen with weapons to fight Soviet troops in the 1980s, the sources say. It was another result of the deliberations at the White House, which decided that such assistance would be an \"unnecessary provocation\". In its desperation to scrape together any valid help for Ukraine, the White House even considered negotiating the delivery of S-400s from Turkey \u2013 the very systems Ankara ordered in 2017 and which spoiled relations between the two NATO allies. After severing Turkey from F-35 shipments over the purchase, Washington is now considering trying to convince Ankara to ditch the systems another way \u2013 by gifting them to Kiev. It is unclear, however, if the White House has decided to go forward with this plan. US President Joe Biden earlier turned down repeated requests from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to establish a no-fly zone above Ukraine after Russia launched a special military operation to demilitarise and \"de-Nazify\" the country. Biden said that there won't be a no-fly zone above Ukraine and not a single US soldier will be sent to fight in the country, as either option might trigger a Third World War. POTUS stressed that such an armed conflict could end up being a nuclear one. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Col. Karen Kwiatkowski, a former analyst for the US Department of Defence. \"Biden probably repeated what he had been briefed prior to his visit to Poland.\" On Monday, Joe Biden was questioned by Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy about what the president meant by telling American troops stationed in Poland: \"You\u2019re going to see when you\u2019re there, and some of you have been there, you\u2019re gonna see \u2014 you\u2019re gonna see women, young people standing in the middle \u2014 in front of a damned tank just saying, \u2018I\u2019m not leaving, I\u2019m holding my ground.'\" The remarks were perceived by some as revealing Washington's plans to put US boots in Ukraine. The White House hastily specified that this wasn't the case. However, while answering Doocy's question, the US president said: \"We were talking about helping train the troops in \u2014 that are \u2014 the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland.\" This clearly contradicted US National Security Adviser Jack Sullivan's statement that the US was not training Ukrainian soldiers. General Tod Wolters, Commander of the United States European Command and NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, asserted to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that the US was not training Ukrainian troops in Poland. However, some US lawmakers alleged that Biden spilled the beans about a \"classified\" Pentagon mission. Biden's words do not seem to be a mere \"gaffe,\" believes geopolitical analyst Tom Luongo. He cites the fact that the rhetoric of the Biden State Department and National Security Council has recently become very aggressive. \"Biden, even if he\u2019s momentarily cogent, could easily just be relaying echoes of previous conversations,\" says Luongo. The US president has recently made a series of bellicose gaffes, including calling the Russian president a \"war criminal\" and claiming that Vladimir Putin \"cannot remain in power.\" Moscow denounced Biden's words as highly inappropriate and reminded him that it's the Russian people who choose their president, not foreign leaders. Judging from the US commander-in-chief's rhetoric, Washington is seeking a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian crisis in words only, according to the observers. \"I don't think the US is interested in a diplomatic resolution,\" says Dave Lindorff. \"For the US, the longer the conflict goes on, the better. It gets back to the late Polish-American National Security advisor Zbignew Brzezinski who wanted to use the Mujahadeen to make Afghanistan into the Soviet Union's 'Vietnam' and to \"kill as many Russians as possible.' Same now in Ukraine. [Secretary of State Antony] Blinken is kind of a low-wattage reincarnation of Brzezinski.\" Meanwhile, Biden's gaffes are fraught with the risk of exacerbating Russo-American tensions: according to the New York Post, \"it is not clear whether Russia would view the US training Ukraine\u2019s military as a[n]\u2026 escalation.\" It can't be ruled out that the Biden administration and its security advisers are mulling over all options, including sending US troops to Ukraine, according to Kwiatkowski. The Biden administration might send American soldiers to fight overseas under some \"proper\" pretext, believes Tom Luongo: \"So scan the British press carefully for signs of what type of false flag they and the US intelligence services will cook up to sell us into yet another disgusting and vile war,\" the geopolitical analyst remarks. On 23 March, the New York Times reported that \"the White House has quietly assembled a team of national security officials\" to consider various Ukraine crisis scenarios including \"a joint military response\" if Russia used \"unconventional\" weapons. \"At the soldier level, the idea of fighting a successful nuclear war has not gained the popularity it has back in the Pentagon E-Ring,\" says Kwiatkowski. \"I suspect, from the looks on the faces of US troops dining with Biden in Poland a few days ago, that they have not actually been consulted about either fighting the Russian Army, or being in the arena of a potential nuclear battlefield.\" The retired Pentagon analyst laments the fact that following the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, \"the US government and its cronies\" appear to be \"working frantically to create a new long, tragic, and costly war in Ukraine.\" "},{"uuid":"9cb6c498-14ba-4bbf-b66a-864e98865dd8","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220328\/ex-sbu-member-says-kiev-tried-to-hide-evidence-of-black-site-prison-at-mariupol-airport--video-1094255138.html","title":"Ex-SBU Member Says Kiev Tried to Hide Evidence of Black Site Prison at Mariupol Airport \u2013 Video","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e6\/03\/1c\/1094255011_0:0:3072:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_e4a395fc182ce2890b965aa1ccab94bc.jpg?source-sid=rian_photo","subtitle":"The purported prison was allegedly used to illegally detain residents of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR), as well as those who sympathised with them on the territories controlled by Ukraine.

He further said that he had visited the place since it was seized by the DPR and noticed that Ukrainian forces had removed the metal cladding from the walls of the freezers previously used as a prison known as the \"Library\". Prozorov said that those who went through imprisonment in the \"Library\", are probably the only ones who can give the testimony required to investigate the crimes by Ukrainian troops and nationalist battalions committed at the Mariupol airport. The former SBU member suggested calling for former inmates of the purported black site to come forward and to question airport employees. The interior of a portion of the alleged black site prison at the airport can be seen in a video shot with the help of DPR fighters: Former SBU member Vasily Prozorov believes that the DPR will find zero documents confirming the existence of the reported prison because no commander would ever sign a paper greenlighting the creation of such an illegal detention site. Any reports of imprisonment at the \"Library\" were likely destroyed by the commander responsible for the sector, Prozorov added. Forces from the DPR, acting in cooperation and with assistance from Russian troops, have seized several areas around and inside Mariupol since the start of Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine.

The G7 objected to the move and vowed not to pay. However, Berlin, one of the biggest buyers of Russian gas, has since asked how such transactions may take place.","content":"Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree regulating gas trade with designated 'unfriendly' states, saying that countries wishing to do business with Moscow must open bank accounts in Russian banks, and stressing that existing contracts will be frozen unless payments are made in rubles. Putin stressed that Russia would continue to meet its obligations to supply gas at volumes and at prices set under existing contracts. However, the need to pay in the Russian currency is not up for negotiation, according to the president. Putin announced on 23 March that Russia would require countries which have introduced sanctions against Russia to pay for their natural gas purchases in rubles. The Russian Central Bank, the government and Gazprom were given one week to amend existing contracts into rubles. Sputnik has obtained the full text of the gas-for-rubles directive. The document, entitled \"On a special procedure for the fulfillment of obligations by foreign buyers to Russian suppliers of natural gas\", orders that payments for gas exported as of 1 April to countries which have engaged in \"unfriendly actions against the Russian Federation, Russian legal entities and individuals\" be made in rubles. Supplies will be frozen if an attempt is made to pay in foreign currency, in the event of a failure to pay in full, or a failure to make payment from an authorised Russian bank. \"The Joint Stock Company Gazprombank, which for the purposes of this decree is an authorised bank ... opens special type K ruble accounts and special type K foreign currency accounts for payments for the gas supplied on the basis of applications made by foreign buyers,\" the document notes. The decree allows the Russian government commission which is responsible for the control of foreign investments to issue permits exempting the ruble payments rule. European gas futures jumped to more than $1,450 per thousand cubic metres immediately after Putin's comments. German's Ministry of Economy chief Robert Habeck told reporters that he \"hasn't seen\" the directive, but stressed that Berlin was well prepared for Russia's decisions on gas supplies and that it wouldn't allow Putin to \"blackmail us\". Putin was said to have informed Scholz that the Russian move on gas payments was caused by the West's decision to freeze some $300 billion in Russian reserves abroad, including in European countries, in the wake of Moscow's military operation in Ukraine. Russian supplies account for more than 40 percent of Germany's natural gas consumption. In his remarks on Thursday, Putin also touched on the global economic crisis threatening the planet, and who he believes is responsible. \"Global markets are falling, but the value of shares in companies in the US military-industrial complex are only growing. Capital is flowing to the United States, depriving other regions of the world of resources for development,\" Putin said.  Step by step, Putin suggested, western politicians were making decisions pushing the world economy to a crisis state. \"They will lead to a breakdown in production and logistics ties, cause inflation to rise, and a decrease in the wellbeing of millions of people, and in the poorest countries, to the tragedy of mass starvation. The food crisis will be followed by another wave of migration, including - and above all - to European countries,\" he predicted. Putin also commented on the prospects facing Russia's aviation industry, and the economy in general. \"I propose to proceed from the fact that previous levels of interaction with our former partners will not be reached in the near future. We are not going to close ourselves off from anyone, and we will not be a closed country. But we must proceed from the realities that are emerging,\" Putin said. \"We have every opportunity to ensure that the aviation industry not only overcomes the present difficulties, but also receives a new impetus for development,\" he suggested. There is also \"room for opportunities for Russian aircraft manufacturers, design bureaus, suppliers of materials, assemblies and components,\" Putin said. The president expressed confidence that the proportion of domestic aircraft in the fleets of Russian airlines will \"grow dramatically\" in the years to come. Russia's domestic aircraft manufacturing industry has a rich and storied history. During the Cold War, Soviet-made civilian passenger airplanes and helicopters accounted for nearly one-third of all aircraft produced globally. Output plunged in the Nineties and Noughties thanks to market reforms, the breakdown of Soviet-era supply chains and lobbying by global aviation giants such as Airbus and Boeing to supply planes to Russian carriers. However, in the 2010s - and particularly after western countries started sanctioning Russia amid the Ukraine crisis that began in 2014 - the government began to devote considerable material resources and other forms of support to domestic aircraft manufacturers.

Brussels banned iron and steel imports from Russia, outlawed the sale of aircraft, spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines, as well as the supplies of goods and technological equipment for the oil, aviation, and space industries. EU citizens have been banned from investing in the Russian energy sector. Dozens of EU companies have halted or stopped operations in Russia.Moscow considers the move unlawful and unjustified and has imposed its own counter measures.Russia attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."},{"uuid":"9cfb6478-c913-4e73-95f8-b8ded79f22d3","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552736-lavrov-west-total-war\/","title":"West waging \u2018total, hybrid war\u2019 on Russia \u2013 Lavrov","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623eb03e2030272a865dede5.jpg","subtitle":"Moscow\u2019s top diplomat said Western nations are seeking to \u2018strangle\u2019 and \u2018destroy\u2019 the Russian economy with sanctions","content":"Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has accused the West of launching a \u201ctotal, hybrid war\u201d against his country, saying that a recent wave of sanctions aim to \u201cexterminate\u201d\u00a0its economy.The comments came during a meeting of the Gorchakov Public Diplomacy Fund in Moscow on Friday, where Lavrov said Western retaliation to Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine last month amounted to a form of\u00a0\u201cwar.\u201d\u201cToday it has been declared a real hybrid war, a total war,\u201d he said, adding that the latter term \u201cwas used by Hitler's Germany\u201d and \u201cis now voiced by many European politicians when they talk about what they want to do with the Russian Federation.\u201dThe goals are not hidden, they declared them publicly \u2013 to destroy, break, exterminate, strangle the Russian economy and Russia as a whole.The minister suggested the sanctions would not have the intended effect of isolating Russia\u2019s economy, noting that \u201cthe majority of the countries in the world are interested in an equal interstate cooperation based on the key principles of the UN Charter.\u201d He urged members of the Diplomacy Fund to take note of nations that have declined to join the \u201canti-Russian hysteria,\u201d despite pressure from the United States and a number of allied powers.\u00a0Those countries include both China and India, which have refused to cut ties with Moscow over its military operation in Ukraine, though both have urged an end to the fighting and a diplomatic solution to the crisis.

The latter distributed the funds to the bondholders.Making this payment means Russia has avoided a widely expected external bond default. There was speculation in the media that the nation could default for the first time in a century, as much of its foreign currency holdings have been frozen by the US, EU, and a number of other countries.Moscow has used money from frozen accounts to pay its external debt, daring Western countries to try to block the payments. Russia has accused the US and its allies of trying to engineer an artificial default in the country by not allowing it access to its estimated $300 billion in foreign reserves held abroad.Russia has 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion. Prior to the Ukraine crisis, roughly $20 billion was held by investment funds and money managers outside Russia.The country now has to make a $102 million payment on March 28, followed by a $447 million payment that must be made in dollars on March 31.

According to findings by Russia\u2019s Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Troops, one company connected to these biolabs and their work was founded by Hunter Biden and Christopher Heinz, the latter the stepson of former US Secretary of State John Kerry. Rosemont Seneca Partners was founded in 2009 by Biden, Heinz and Heinz\u2019s college roommate and fellow financier, Devon Archer, according to the Financial Times. Biden and Heinz were described as company co-owners and Archer as a \u201cmanaging partner\u201d in a report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The private equity firm was anchored by the Heinz family alternative investment fund, Rosemont Capital, and was formed to \u201cbe populated by political loyalists and positioned to strike profitable deals overseas with foreign governments and officials with whom the US government was negotiating,\u201d according to the 2018 book \u201cSecret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,\u201d by Peter Schweizer. This became a problem the following year, when BHR joined the Chinese state-owned defense firm Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) to buy anti-vibration automotive parts from American precision-parts manufacturer Henniges - a deal agreed to during the Obama administration. A US Senate investigation in 2019 found a significant conflict of interest in the deal, as anti-vibration technology is considered \u201cdual use,\u201d having both civilian and military applications. In one notable incident that Joe Biden boasted about years later but which Western media has tried to spin as conspiracy theory, Biden successfully pressured then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire Viktor Shokin, Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor, who was heading an investigation of Zlochevsky and Burisma. Zlochevsky, meanwhile, was funneling millions to Hunter Biden and Archer for sitting on Burisma\u2019s board and for Rosemont Seneca\u2019s \u201cconsulting services,\u201d documents obtained by the Senate probe show. Rosemont Seneca sought to disguise its investments in Burisma, as did top Obama administration officials, including then-Secretary of State John Kerry - Heinz\u2019s stepfather. Heinz attempted to distance himself from Archer\u2019s and Hunter\u2019s decision to join the Burisma board, writing to Kerry\u2019s chief of staff, David Wade, that \u201cbased only on Heinz\u2019s assurances, that \u2018Rosemont Seneca was not involved\u2019 with Burisma,\u201d Heinz told the Senate probe. According to the paper, Heinz pulled out of Rosemont as a result of his partners\u2019 decision. \u201cThe lack of judgment in this matter was a major catalyst for Mr. Heinz ending his business relationships with Mr. Archer and Mr. Biden,\u201d Bastardi suggested.

The president\u2019s son and his partners in a firm called Rosemont Seneca also invested $500,000 in the contractor.At least one of the documents suggested that Metabiota\u2019s interest in Ukraine went beyond research and money-making. An executive with the contractor, Mary Guttieri, explained\u00a0in an April 2014 memo to Hunter Biden of \u201chow we can potentially leverage our team, networks and concepts to assert Ukraine\u2019s cultural and economic independence from Russia and continued integration into Western society.\u201dAnother memo showed that Biden had pitched a \u201cscience project\u201d involving Metabiota and Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company where Biden made millions of dollars as a board member. His pay was cut by half after his father\u2019s stint as US vice president ended in January 2017.The revelations come one day after Russian military officials alleged that US agencies and high-level Democrats, including Hunter Biden, have been involved in backing bioweapons research in Ukraine. The officials cited documents that had been seized by Russian soldiers in the former Soviet republic.However, some Western media outlets dismissed the claims as Russian propaganda meant to justify Moscow\u2019s military attack on\u00a0Ukraine. In many cases, the allegations were brushed off or ridiculed without even taking them seriously enough to include a US government response. For instance, the Daily Beast declared in a headline, \u201cRussia ramps up the crazy,\u201d while state-funded NPR and other outlets referred to the accusations as \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cpropaganda\u201d without any apparent probing of the facts. Even the Daily Mail itself, before obtaining the latest Biden emails, said Russia had ramped up its \u201cwild propaganda campaign\u201d by making its bioweapons claims.The reaction echoed the response in October 2020, when the New York Post broke a story alleging overseas influence-peddling by the Biden family, citing emails obtained from a laptop that Hunter had abandoned at a Delaware repair shop. Spreading the report was blocked on social media, where the Post was censored, and mainstream media outlets suggested that the scandal was the result of a Russian disinformation campaign.Thus, the original scoop was essentially buried just weeks before Biden was elected president, in an extraordinary case of media bias. However,\u00a0last week, the New York Times admitted that the laptop and its contents were authentic.Government records show that Metabiota was awarded an $18.4 million contract by the Pentagon, the Daily Mail added. Emails showed that Hunter Biden claimed to be helping the contractor \u201cget new customers,\u201d including government agencies."},{"uuid":"a020b5b9-65df-476e-9bfe-79b45cad3ebb","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552549-bush-blair-ukraine-lecture-russia\/","title":"George Bush and Tony Blair lack the moral authority to lecture Russia on Ukraine","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623b1c0085f5404ff7779ff9.jpg","subtitle":"Coming from the leaders who started the bloody Iraq war, it\u2019s hypocritical, to say the least","content":"Current and former Western leaders who have achieved eternal notoriety for launching the Iraq War, as well as other military disasters, are clearly the wrong people to lecture Russia over its actions in Ukraine.As George W. Bush and Tony Blair are emerging from political retirement to pontificate on Russia\u2019s \u201cauthoritarian bullying\u201d against Ukraine, the question arises: does such a surreal spectacle underscore the public\u2019s notorious short-term memory, or does it prove the media\u2019s vast power to shape public opinion in favor of its latest agenda? All things considered, it\u2019s most likely a wicked combination of the two noxious ingredients.\u00a0\u00a0Whatever the case, it defies reality that these former US and British leaders, whose past military exploits have been described in some quarters as actual war crimes, are now weighing in on the legitimacy of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, or any other conflict for that matter. To put it another way, Bush and Blair acting like long-haired anti-war activists is a bit like Greta Thunberg shaking the pop-poms for the coal industry.Consider, for example, the convoluted comments uttered by George W. Bush on the same day that Russia started its military operation in Ukraine: \u201cRussia\u2019s attack on Ukraine,\u201d the official statement reads, \u201cconstitutes the gravest security crisis on the European continent since World War II.\u201d\u00a0 Bush, who presided for eight long years in the disastrous War on Terror, bellowed like a Puritan preacher that he condemns Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cunprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\u201cThe American government and people must stand in solidarity with \u2026 the Ukrainian people as they seek freedom and the right to choose their own future,\u201d he added from the pulpit.While it might be true that the quickly unraveling events in Ukraine represent the \u201cgravest security crisis\u201d since the last world war, it is simply na\u00efve to believe that so-called \u2018Russian aggression\u2019 is solely responsible for that grim state of affairs. Indeed, it would be disingenuous to discuss the tragedy now unfolding in Ukraine without including a 12-inch-long footnote on US-led NATO, the 30-member military bloc that is now, to put it in more anthropomorphic terms, \u2018kissing Russia\u2019s border\u2019. Putin spoke out against these unwanted advances back in 2007 at the Munich Security Conference when he pointedly asked Western leaders \u201cagainst whom is this expansion intended?\u201d Instead of providing an acceptable answer, NATO opted to grow its membership by another four countries.\u00a0\u00a0Then, without an ounce of self-awareness, Bush proclaimed that the Ukrainian people have a right to \u201cchoose their own future.\u201d While few people would argue against such modern common sense, where was that judicious counsel back in 2014, when high-ranking US officials like Victoria Nuland and John McCain were literally on the ground in Kiev, fomenting the fires of political strife that ultimately ended with democratically-elected president Viktor Yanukovych forced from office and replaced with US-backed Petro Poroshenko? While people will argue for years to come over Russia\u2019s eventual course of action, which took much of the world by surprise, it cannot be denied that Western meddling in Ukrainian affairs helped to bring the situation to a boil.This failure to appreciate the complexity of the situation from Moscow\u2019s perspective was obvious in another gratuitous lecture to Russia, this one courtesy of the former UK prime minister, Tony Blair. Writing in the Daily Mail, Blair kicked off his warmed over clich\u00e9s with some cheap Nazi analogies (\u201cHitler led a Europe-wide fascist movement. Putin\u2019s war is a one-man mission\u201d) before arguing that the West needs to \u201cincrease the supply of weapons to Ukraine, particularly its SAM (surface-to-air missile) capacity \u2013 and give a commitment that arming Ukraine will be ongoing.\u201dClearly, Western leaders seem totally committed to courageously fighting the Russians down to every last Ukrainian.More to the point, haven\u2019t we learned from past disasters that leaders like Blair and Bush simply cannot be trusted?As early as 1999, Tony Blair already had blood on his hands, figuratively speaking, in the Kosovo War, which saw NATO forces attack Yugoslavia without a mandate from the UN Security Council. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, some 500 Yugoslav civilians were killed over the course of the relentless 78-day NATO bombardment, which even managed to hit the Chinese Embassy, resulting in three deaths.Disastrous as it was, the Kosovo War was just a dress rehearsal for one of the greatest humanitarian crises of modern times \u2013 the 2003 Iraq War. Amid some of the largest protests ever recorded, throngs ascended on capitals around the planet in a last-ditch effort to halt Bush and Blair\u2019s march to war after accusing President Saddam Hussein \u2013 without a shred of evidence \u2013 of harboring weapons of mass destruction. In Rome, a crowd of three million gathered on February 15, 2003 to protest against the impending invasion, a feat that got the Italian capital entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for \u2018largest anti-war rally\u2019.\u00a0Bush and Blair arrogantly ignored this display of democracy in action, however, commencing with a \u2018shock and awe\u2019 campaign against Baghdad on March 19, 2003. To paraphrase Mark Twain, truth was still lacing up its boots while the Iraqi people were dying from outright lies, no thanks to a corporate-owned media industrial complex that refused to challenge the WMD claims until much later.Responding to revelations that the American and British leaders had essentially lied their way into the Iraq War, the writer Michael Massing proposed a very good question to journalists after the dust had finally settled: Why didn\u2019t the mainstream media tell us more \u201cabout these deceptions and concealments in the months when the administration was pressing its case for regime change \u2013 when, in short, it might have made a difference?\u201dNot until the publication of the Iraq Inquiry in 2016, long after some one million Iraqis had been displaced, killed, and injured as a result of the illicit invasion, was it determined that \u201cthe UK chose to join the invasion of Iraq before the peaceful options for disarmament had been exhausted. Military action at that time was not a last resort.\u201dIn addition to finding that Blair had \u201cdeliberately exaggerated the threat posed by the Iraqi regime,\u201d the Chilcot inquiry revealed a private letter sent to George W. Bush from the UK prime minister that stated, \u201cI will be with you, whatever.\u201d With those words it is a bit easier to understand why Blair was dubbed \u201cBush\u2019s poodle\u201d in less supportive circles.On a personal note, I believe that Russia, which has been forced to watch its \u2018near afar\u2019 transform practically overnight into a NATO training ground, is politically mature enough to discuss its controversial actions in Ukraine with just about anyone. However, when the conversation has all the hallmarks of a censored social media post, which permits pot shots and apparently even calls for violence against Russians, then the discussion will not get very far.At the same time, Western leaders, both present and past, are certainly in no position to lecture Russia on its current behavior, whatever one may think about it. In fact, Western leaders, who ignored Moscow\u2019s warnings for decades, must take their share of responsibility for the turmoil that is now happening in Ukraine. Only once they admit that to themselves will Russia, Ukraine, and the West be able to turn the page on this horrible chapter in its relations and move on.\u00a0"},{"uuid":"a06012d3-34e2-4984-92d2-ef83fa8945d5","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552366-chinese-envoy-ukraine-peace\/","title":"China explains its \u2018unique role\u2019 in resolving Russia-Ukraine conflict","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623826a8203027296e491b15.jpg","subtitle":"Qin Gang, the country\u2019s envoy in the US, said Beijing will do \u201ceverything\u201d to de-escalate the crisis","content":"Qin Gang, the Chinese ambassador to the US, has said Beijing will work to achieve peace between Russia and Ukraine, rather than sending arms to any side in the conflict.

The poll did not ask about other forms of intervention, however, including a US-backed no-fly zone \u2013 an idea repeatedly proposed by Ukraine itself \u2013 or a troop deployment.The survey indicated widespread support for retaliatory sanctions on Moscow, with 68% approving \u201csanctions in general\u201d and an even greater number (70%) backing a full-blown ban on Russian oil imports. A majority (55%) said they favored the penalties even if they inflict \u201cdamage\u201d to the US economy, though a large plurality of 42% argued that \u201climiting\u201d such blowback should be a priority.While the White House has imposed a series of sweeping measures to \u201cisolate\u201d the Russian economy and approved hundreds of millions in weapons shipments for Ukraine in recent weeks, it has made efforts to avoid becoming a direct party to the conflict. US officials have repeatedly explained that a no-fly zone is liable to spark a third world war, and have been hesitant to openly support major arms transfers to Kiev, such as fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles, instead largely supplying shoulder-fired missiles, ammunition, and other forms of \u201clethal\u201d aid.Moscow attacked the neighboring state in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocol was designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

Biden earlier appeared to call for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s removal from power, before walking back the statement, then making it again.\u201cA lot of times when you\u2019re around somebody who\u2019s in cognitive decline, you find yourself trying to help them with a sentence, trying to help them complete it,\u201d Paul told Fox News host Jesse Watters on Monday evening, adding that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t have to do that for the commander-in-chief.\u201dEarlier on Monday, Biden told reporters that he \u201cwas not articulating a change in policy\u201d when he called Putin a \u201cbutcher\u201d who \u201ccannot remain in power\u201d during a visit to Poland over the weekend. Despite assuring the press that he wasn\u2019t demanding regime change in Moscow, Biden then said again that Putin \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in power.\u201dBiden read from pre-prepared cue cards during the press conference.\u201cIt is actually a national security risk because he\u2019s sending signals that no one in their right mind would want to send to Russia at this point,\u201d Paul continued. \u201cWe aren't trying to replace Putin in Russia. We aren\u2019t trying to have regime change. We\u2019re not sending troops into Ukraine, and we\u2019re not going to respond in kind with chemical weapons,\u201d he stated, referring to two other statements that Biden made and the White House walked back.These statements involved Biden seemingly telling US soldiers that they would be deployed to Ukraine, and that the US would \u201crespond in kind\u201d to a hypothetical Russian use of chemical weapons on the battlefield. Both actions would result in open war between the US and Russia, something that Biden has repeatedly said he wished to avoid.\u201cSo I do think that it is a real problem, and there\u2019s a humorous angle to this,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really not funny because we\u2019re worried about what he\u2019s saying, precipitating or escalating the conflict in Ukraine into a world war. That\u2019s very serious.\u201dWhile Paul has condemned Russia\u2019s military offensive in Ukraine, the Kentucky Republican opposes any US involvement in the conflict. Prior to Russia\u2019s attack, Paul insisted that Ukraine \u201cshould not and cannot be our problem to solve,\u201d and that the country\u2019s accession into the NATO alliance \u2013 which the US and her allies insist is its right \u2013\u00a0 would be \u201ca recipe for war and disaster.\u201dPaul\u2019s plea for temperance echoes that of French President Emmanuel Macron, who said on Sunday that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t use such words\u201d to describe Putin, and that his main goal regarding Ukraine is \u201cachieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of [Russian] troops by diplomatic means.\u201d\u201cIf we want to do that, we can\u2019t escalate, either in words or actions,\u201d Macron told the broadcaster France 3."},{"uuid":"a0607121-86c2-49c1-9fcd-1c885aeb74d0","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/business\/552487-german-lobby-russia-business\/","title":"German lobby group supports continued business in Russia","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6239fdc185f5400e551fe371.jpg","subtitle":"Hundreds of Western companies have left the country due to sanctions","content":"German Eastern Business Association Chairman Oliver Hermes warned on Tuesday of the implications of Western sanctions against Russia.

Not one word referred to her actual tarnished record of promoting American imperialism and criminal wars.","content":"Now, of course, the Western media would never tend towards such truthful reporting and analysis. Its sanitizing role is constant and standard fare. That is why the Western public is caught up today in this insane moral panic and hypocrisy over the war in Ukraine where Russia is vilified as an unprovoked aggressor and the Kiev Nazi regime (with its Jewish puppet president) is lionized as some kind of innocent victim. The widespread Western public ignorance over what is happening in Ukraine \u2013 the violent background to the present conflict, the CIA coup in 2014, the Nazi paramilitaries attacking Russian-speaking people in the Donbass, the relentless NATO weaponizing of the Russophobic regime, training of its Nazi paramilitaries by NATO troops and so on \u2013 is largely due to the Western media\u2019s systematic lying, omission, and distortion. However, the brain-dead function of the Western media is especially highlighted this week by the death of Madeleine Albright and the total silence about how her career is tightly entwined with today\u2019s conflict. The war in Ukraine is but the front line of a wider proxy war between the United States, NATO and Russia. The former US Secretary of State was one of the main pushers in the American foreign policy establishment of NATO\u2019s eastward expansion. Several eminent US thinkers such as Jack Matlock, the former ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Professor John Mearsheimer, have deplored that expansion as a treacherous, fateful act leading to today\u2019s conflict between the West and Russia. When Albright was Secretary of State in the second Bill Clinton administration (1997-2001), she ushered in the eastward advance of NATO in spite of earlier American assurances to the contrary to Russian leaders. Her most salient \u201cachievement\u201d was to launch the US and NATO war on former Yugoslavia. That war was supposedly in defense of Kosovo-Albanians. But it was really an overture for US imperialism to bomb European countries into the geopolitical shape it desired. Albright died on March 23 at the age of 84 from cancer. The next day, March 24, marked the 23rd anniversary of the beginning of the US-led NATO blitzkrieg on Serbia and its capital Belgrade. Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine is arguably founded on the principle of self-defense given the NATO-backed Kiev regime\u2019s eight years of aggression. That military incursion has been going on for four weeks as of March 24. There have been reportedly 1,400 Russian aerial strike sorties in Ukraine. Despite Western media hysterical reporting about alleged indiscriminate Russian bombing against civilian centers, the Pentagon has quietly admitted and corroborated what Moscow has said, that the Russian campaign has been restrained in order to avoid civilian casualties, as reported by Joe Lauria for Consortium News. Contrast that with the US-led NATO attack on the former Yugoslavia. That war lasted for 78 days during which 10,500 strike sorties were carried out. Some 2,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed. Civilian infrastructure destroyed included 25,000 homes, 20 hospitals, 70 schools, 38 bridges, over 1,000 kilometers of road and railway, 14 airports, as well as water, sewage and power plants. Western media decry Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine as the \u201cworst\u201d act of barbarity in Europe since World War Two. Clearly, that is a gross distortion. The barbarism of the US and NATO in Yugoslavia has been consigned to a memory hole, as far as Western media is concerned. Madeleine Albright paved the way for the 1999 criminal US war in Europe. The NATO operation did not have any authorization from the UN Security Council even for its pretense of \u201cdefending human rights\u201d. The war against the former Yugoslavia was a naked act of aggression. Albright was the architect of that war. At another time she declared the US had the right to use violence unilaterally because it was \u201can indispensable nation\u201d. The path to today\u2019s dangerous proxy conflict between the US-led NATO alliance and Russia can be traced back to the policy formulated by Madeleine Albright and like-minded imperialists in Washington. The destruction of Yugoslavia 23 years ago under her watch has culminated in the present near-war situation between the US and Russia due to relentless and reckless NATO expansionism all the way to Russia\u2019s borders, including the weaponization of a Nazi regime in Ukraine. It should be seen as incredible that her nefarious, paramount relevance for today\u2019s crisis should be so blatantly omitted in Western media. All we can read about her this week were eulogies to Albright\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d diplomacy and being an icon for female achievement. That such a glaring omission can be made at this critically important time just shows the noxious propaganda function of Western media. Totally brain-dead. Meanwhile, alternative critical media have been blacked out as \u201cRussian propaganda\u201d. The brain-dead function of Western media is what makes the danger of war even greater.

Hindu Sena's national president, Vishnu Gupta, and other members criticised Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and said he is the enemy of his own country. Condemning Kiev authorities for handing out weapons to civilians \"to fight their fascist war\", Gupta said that Zelensky \"keeps asking for more and more weapons but not once has he appealed for humanitarian aid for the Ukrainians\". \"The Ukrainian military has killed Russian officers and their negotiator, and yet they call themselves the victims. So far, Ukrainians don't seem to show any intention of stopping the war,\" Gupta said.

Gupta blamed the US and his allies for escalating the situation \"by unnecessarily interfering in two countries' bilateral ties\". \"The western world and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) must stop their proxy war against Russia endangering the civilian population of Ukraine and Russia.\" The Hindu Sena's national president also accused Ukrainian authorities of blackmail as India had abstained from voting on a US-sponsored UN Security Council resolution that condemned Russia's special operation in February. \"India or any other country abstaining from voting, as a sovereign nation, has every right to take a stand according to its interests and relationship and no country or its citizens have the right to humiliate and beat up other citizens.

Later, many media reports surfaced of discrimination and humiliation in the FACIST &amp; RACIST Ukraine. There are also reports of shooting foreign students trying to leave Ukraine,\" he said. Indian students that were stuck in different parts of Ukraine accused Ukrainian security forces and border officials of racist treatment as they attempted to flee the country. \"No media is talking about Ukraine changing its constitution to exclude the Russian-speaking population and is doing ethnic cleansing of Russians in Ukraine, something that western media has wrongfully accused India of doing in Kashmir for years.\" Gupta said that western media has consistently spread pro-Ukraine propaganda and fake news against Russia. He also stressed that Russia has every right to take necessary action to safeguard its borders, adding that India will always support Russia, \"as Russia has always been a true friend of India\". On 24 February, Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine after the newly recognised breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian aggression. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had made the tough decision to start the operation to stop the genocide of the Donbass population which the Kiev regime had been waging for eight years.

The German- and French-brokered Minsk Protocols were designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO.

In addition to economic measures, London banned Russian ships from UK ports.  Russia started its special operation in Ukraine following calls from the country's breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk to protect their civilians amid intensified shelling by Kiev's forces. According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, another key goal of the operation is to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" Ukraine, where numerous radical neo-Nazi battalions have been actively participating in the Donbass conflict, presenting a threat to the Russian-speaking civilian population.

There is nothing more than what was said there\", Ryabkov said. The diplomat emphasised that whether bilateral ties will be severed depends on the course Washington chooses. At the same time, he said that if Washington manages to have a positive impact Kiev, which he doubts will happen, \"then there will generally be a certain prospect for normalising relations\". The deputy foreign minister reiterated that sanctions or US pressure will have zero influence on Russia's determination to complete the special military operation in Ukraine and protect Donbass. According to Ryabkov, Washington is fully responsible for the current level of Russia-US relations. Moscow urges the US to stop demonising Russia, the diplomat added. Relations between Russia and the United States can no longer develop the way they used to. The Russian deputy foreign minister also criticised the US for refusing a strategic stability dialogue with Russia. \"They have not confirmed their readiness to continue the dialogue on strategic stability,\" Ryabkov told the Rossiya 1 broadcaster, adding that Washington in time will realise that it has \"shot itself in the foot.\" On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry handed a note of protest to US Ambassador John Sullivan, stressing that President Joe Biden's \"unacceptable\" remarks about Vladimir Putin have pushed bilateral relations to the brink of collapse. Biden called his Russian counterpart a \"war criminal\" amid the ongoing special op in Ukraine, a comment which Moscow lambasted as \"unworthy of a statesman of such high rank\". Speaking with reporters at the White House last week, Biden was asked whether he considers the Russian president to be a war criminal. After initially responding in the negative, Biden returned seconds later and clarified: \"I think he is a war criminal\". The diplomatic breakdown comes as the United States along with dozens of European nations have imposed several batches of sanctions against Russia, targeting its economy, space industry, financial institutions, businesses, etc., in response to Moscow's special military operation to demilitarise and \u201cde-Nazify\u201d Ukraine. The operation was authorised by President Vladimir Putin on 24 February following a request from the newly-recognised Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. The president stressed that the decision, as tough as it was, was made in order to protect the Donbass population, which has faced continued attacks and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years.

A number of countries have come forward either with new ideas or indeed more pledges of money,\u201d Wallace told reporters after a donor conference in London aimed at increasing arms shipments to Kiev.Wallace said that Britain\u2019s latest cache of weapons would include longer-range artillery, ammunition, and anti-air missiles.The UK has already donated more than 4,000 NLAW anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, at a cost of \u00a320,000 ($26,300) per disposable unit.Earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his cabinet that he wants to\u00a0send Kiev\u00a0\u201cmore lethal\u201d weapons, reportedly mentioning artillery, anti-ship missiles, and more advanced air defense systems. It is unclear whether the air defense systems mentioned by Johnson and Wallace would be shoulder-fired missiles, like the \u2018Stinger\u2019 units already sent by some NATO countries, or larger vehicle-mounted missile batteries.Sending the latter into Ukraine would pose problems of its own, as Russia has declared convoys of military equipment to be \u201clegitimate targets\u201d once on Ukrainian territory.The effectiveness of the weapons already sent by the UK is hotly debated.

Nebenzia said that the aftermath of these activities could have \"splashed out\" beyond the borders of not just Ukraine, but the entire region. The Russian Defence Ministry earlier accused the Pentagon of funding biological research in Ukraine in order to create bioweapons and conduct studies on the spread of dangerous infections and viruses.  The United States has called claims of US-funded biowarfare programmes in Ukraine \"false pretexts\" that are created \"in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions in Ukraine\". The statements from Washington came after Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said there were biological laboratories in Ukraine and added that the US was concerned about Russians possibly taking control over them. The Russian Defence Ministry, however, rolled out a handful of documents that, it said, pointed to the fact that components of biological weapons were being created in Ukraine with direct US involvement and financing.   According to the released documents, several top Ukrainian biolabs had received tens of millions of dollars to study infectious diseases, particularly looking into pathogens of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, leptospirosis and hantaviruses.

I\u2019ve had this problem in training since childhood, so it\u2019s not a problem at all,\u201d\u00a0said the star, who celebrates her 18th birthday on Monday.Elsewhere, the Channel One Cup marked a return to the ice for fellow teenage star Valieva after her Olympic dream turned sour in Beijing.Valieva produced a simplified free skate routine on Sunday compared to the program which has previously earned her a world record score, and included just one ultra-C element.Nonetheless, Valieva said she had been pleased to return after her Olympic travails.\u201cI\u2019m happy that the Channel One Cup took place,\u201d\u00a0said the 15-year-old. \u201cA full arena, it\u2019s out of this world.

Speaking before a large and enthusiastic crowd in the Polish capital of Warsaw, US President Joe Biden concluded his remarks by going off-script. After condemning what he called his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cbrutality\u201d in Ukraine, Biden uttered nine words that, in a blink of an eye, made moot whatever else had been accomplished on this trip: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, this man [Putin] cannot remain in power.\u201dBiden departed the venue and headed straight for Air Force One, which was standing by to fly him back to the US. Before his plane could get off the ground, the White House was scrambling to contain the damage done by Biden\u2019s most recent gaffe. \u201cThe President\u2019s point,\u201d an unnamed White House official explained to the press, \u201cwas that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin\u2019s power in Russia, or regime change.\u201dWhen Biden arrived back in the US, he was asked if he was, in fact, calling for regime change in Moscow. Biden offered a terse one-word answer: \u201cNo.\u201dBut the off-the-cuff statement continued to haunt Biden, who was compelled to later offer a more detailed explanation for his outburst, telling the press \u201cI was expressing the moral outrage I felt\u2026[at] the actions of this man [i.e., Putin],\u201d\u00a0Biden said. \u201cI wasn't then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change.\u201dBiden later added that \u201cNobody believes I was talking about taking down Putin. Nobody believes that.\u201dApparently enough people were concerned about that very issue to prompt diplomats in the US and Europe to go into overdrive to explain otherwise. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared that the US had \u201crepeatedly\u201d stated that \u201cwe do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia\u2013or anywhere else. For us, it\u2019s not about regime change,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe Russian people have to decide who they want to lead them.\u201dJosep Borrell, the EU\u2019s chief diplomat, also stepped up to explain away Biden\u2019s remarks. \u201c[In the EU] we are not after a regime change, that is something for the Russian citizens to decide, if they of course could decide that.\u201dUnfortunately for both Blinken and Borrell, the evidence seems to suggest otherwise. According to British journalist Niall Ferguson, a senior Biden administration official was quoted as saying, prior to Biden\u2019s slip of the tongue, that in the aftermath of the Russian military incursion into Ukraine, \u201cThe only end game now is the end of Putin regime. Until then, all the time Putin stays, [Russia] will be a pariah state that will never be welcomed back into the community of nations.\u201dNeither the sentiment (i.e., Putin has to go) nor the mechanism of regime change (that the Russian people will force him out) represent new thinking in terms of the West\u2019s approach to the current Russian government. In fact, both are well known to Russia. According to Michael McFaul, the US Ambassador to Russia from 2012-2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that the US works hard to foster regime changes around the world, including in Russia, through the vehicle of so-called \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d or mass civil uprisings.Back in 2005, McFaul himself wrote an entire paper on US efforts at regime change in the former USSR. This was one of the reasons that President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to send him to Moscow proved so unpopular with the Russian side.The Kremlin accused the US of engaging in such action in Russia following the December 2011 Russian Duma election, narrowly won by then-Prime Minister Putin\u2019s party. At a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton following the 2011 Duma election, expressed her\u00a0\u201cserious concern about the conduct of the elections,\u201d and called for a \u201cfull investigation of all reports of fraud and intimidation,\u201d adding \u201cThe Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted. And that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them.\u201dPutin in turn accused Clinton of giving \u201cthe signal\u201d to opposition leaders to undertake mass unrest to undermine the Russian elections. \u201c[Opposition leaders] heard the signal and with the support of the US state department began active work,\u201d\u00a0Putin said after Clinton\u2019s comments. \u201cWe are all grownups here. We all understand the organizers are acting according to a well-known scenario and in their own mercenary political interests.\u201dMcFaul underscored the concern on the part of Putin when it came to Clinton\u2019s remarks. \u201cHe was genuinely worried about this mobilization against him,\u201d\u00a0McFaul said later, \u201cand that\u2019s when he pivoted hard against us. For Putin, this was confirming his theory of US foreign policy.\u201dMcFaul would know, given the fact that he was the architect of the so-called 'Russia reset' policy undertaken by the administration of President Barack Obama in 2009. The real purpose of this reset policy, however, was regime change\u2013to facilitate the empowerment of President Dmitry Medvedev, the former prime minister who had swapped places with Putin in 2008 due to the Russian Constitution limiting Putin to two consecutive terms in office (the Constitution has since been amended), to permanently replace Putin as president.\u00a0Under McFaul\u2019s influence, the White House limited contact with Putin, placing all its attention on Medvedev. This full-court press for preventing Putin\u2019s return to the Kremlin as president extended to Joe Biden, who at the time was Obama\u2019s vice president.During a trip to Moscow in March 2011, Biden allegedly urged Putin not to seek reelection, telling a group of Russian opposition leaders that it would be better for Russia if Putin did not run for re-election next year. \u201cAt the end of the meeting,\u201d Boris Nemtsov, a leading opposition figure who was murdered in Moscow on February 27, 2015, noted in his blog, \u201cBiden said that in Putin\u2019s place he would not stand for president in 2012 because this would be bad for the country and for himself.\u201dPutin, of course, ignored Biden\u2019s \u201cadvice,\u201d and went on to re-take the presidency in the March 2012 election.The Russian government has long held that Western intelligence services had been using \u201cdemocracy promotion\u201d as a front to organize political opposition to Putin with the goal of removing him from office\u2013i.e., regime change. One of the most public aspects of this effort was the discovery by Russia of a so-called \u201cspy rock\u201d used by the British intelligence agency, MI6, to communicate with its agents in Moscow. At the same time this object (in reality, a covert electronic device used to facilitate communications) was in operation, the Russian intelligence services were accusing the British of secretly funding Russian political opposition groups.Incidents such as the \u2018spy rock\u2019 led the Russian government to crack down on foreign-funded non-governmental organizations (NGOs), first passing laws which compelled groups that receive foreign funding and are deemed to engage in political activities to register as \u201cforeign agents,\u201d before barring NGOs altogether if they were deemed to pose a threat to Russia\u2019s constitutional order, defense or security. The list of banned organizations included USAID, prompting the Obama administration to withdraw from the Civil Society Working Group of the US-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission. Thomas Melia, the group\u2019s American co-chair, observed that the \u201crecent steps taken by the Russian government to impose restrictions on civil society\u2026called into serious question whether maintaining that mechanism was either useful or appropriate.\u201d His sentiments were echoed by State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, who told the press that \u201cthe working group was not advancing the cause of civil society in Russia.\u201dLeft unspoken was the reality that what the US called \u201cadvancing the cause of civil society in Russia\u201d was seen by Russia as little more than thinly disguised efforts at regime change through foreign-funded \u201ccolor revolution.\u201dWhile the overt and covert efforts of the US and its western allies to undermine and overthrow the Putin government by facilitating internal political opposition inside Russia took a hiatus during the four years of the Trump administration, the election of Joe Biden in 2020, and the advent of the current Ukraine crisis, has led to the re-engagement by the Biden administration to attempt to weaken Putin\u2019s hold on power and, ultimately, to remove the long-serving Russian president from office.The Biden administration has taken to the artifice of speaking to the people of Russia directly to foment internal unrest inside Russia. \u201cWe know many of you want no part of this war,\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently said, addressing the people of Russia. \u201cYou\u2013like Ukrainians, like Americans, like people everywhere\u2013want the same basic things: good jobs, clean air and water, the chance to raise your kids in safe neighborhoods, to send them to good schools, to give them better lives than you had. How in the world does President Putin\u2019s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine help you achieve any of these things?\u201dLeft unsaid was what Blinken expected the Russian people to do about it.Blinken\u2019s comments followed those made by Joe Biden in the days leading up to the Russian military incursion into Ukraine when, on February 15, the US president addressed the Russian people directly: \u201cTo the citizens of Russia: You are not our enemy,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd I do not believe you want a bloody, destructive war against Ukraine\u2013a country and a people with whom you share such deep ties of family, history, and culture.\u201dThe State Department has taken to sending out tweets in the Russian language encouraging public demonstrations against the war. \u201cThe open protest of Russians against President Putin and his war is a very courageous act,\u201d\u00a0one such tweet declares. \u201cAs President Biden said, the people of Russia are not our enemy. We blame this war on President Putin, not them.\u201dThe Biden administration has gone out of its way to make sure that its program of communicating directly to the Russian people to promote domestic discontent inside Russia is part and parcel of an overall strategy to remove Putin from office. Biden himself underscored in his February 15 remarks that \u201cWe do not seek to destabilize Russia.\u201dBut some in the US elite are, in fact, calling for the removal of Putin from power. \u201cIs there a Brutus in Russia?\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican (from South Carolina) known for his anti-Putin sentiment, wrote in a March 3 tweet. \u201cIs there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military? The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out. You would be doing your country\u2013and the world\u2013a great service.\u201dWhen called out for his tweet, Graham doubled down. \u201cHe [Putin] needs to be dealt with by the Russian people,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI\u2019m not asking to invade Russia to take him out. I\u2019m not asking to send American ground forces into Ukraine to fight the Russian army. I am asking the Russian people to rise up and end this reign of terror.\u201dThe Biden White House was quick to push back against Graham\u2019s March 3 tweet. \u201cNo, we are not advocating for killing the leader of a foreign country or a regime change,\u201d\u00a0White House spokesperson Jen Psaki noted. \u201cThat is not the position of the United States government and certainly not a statement you\u2019d hear come from the mouth of anybody working in this administration.\u201dThen Joe Biden, the president of the United States, gave voice to that very same sentiment during his Warsaw address: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, this man [Putin] cannot remain in power.\u201dThere simply is no other way to spin that statement. Whether spoken or unspoken, it is clear to all that the official policy of the United States is, and has been since 2009, regime change in Moscow, using the forces of so-called \u201cdemocratic reform\u201d (i.e., mass unrest) to oust President Putin.Unfortunately for Biden, Blinken, Graham and their fellow regime-change travelers, an opinion poll from Levada (recognized as a foreign agent in Russia) showed that the Russian leader\u2019s approval rating was over 71%. The chances of their regime-change fantasy coming true at this stage in the game are exactly zero."},{"uuid":"a7702b5c-1232-48ff-b64c-99617f59bc56","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220330\/lavrov-kievs-readiness-to-ensure-non-bloc-non-nuclear-status-of-ukraine-is-significant-progress-1094333487.html","title":"Lavrov: Kiev's Readiness to Ensure Non-Bloc, Non-Nuclear Status of Ukraine is Significant Progress","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e5\/07\/08\/1083334123_0:0:3071:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_680d5223d9e4de6ae9e4d196b351a2d9.jpg?source-sid=rian_photo","subtitle":"The Ukrainian side rolled out a list of proposals during its talks with Russia in Istanbul, Turkey, on Tuesday, that included Kiev agreeing to a non-bloc and non-nuclear status and rejecting the idea of returning Crimea and Donbass by military means, among others.","content":"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has assessed the outcome of the Russia-Ukraine talks held in Istanbul on Tuesday as a positive step ahead, even though this is not the final result. According to Russia's top diplomat, Kiev's readiness to ensure a non-nuclear and non-bloc status of Ukraine is significant progress. He stressed that the Ukrainian side has also confirmed its understanding that the issues of Crimea, which rejoined Russia in 2014, and Donbass, which declared its independence from Ukraine the same year, are a done deal. Lavrov made the statement shortly after Russia's chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said that Tuesday's talks marked the first time that Kiev authorities expressed their readiness to negotiate with Moscow. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian delegation handed written proposals over to the Russian negotiating team, confirming their readiness for \"a neutral, non-aligned and non-nuclear status, along with a refusal to produce and deploy all types  of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and bacteriological ones, and a ban on the presence of foreign military bases and foreign troops on the territory of the country\", Medinsky said. The list of other Ukrainian proposals goes as follows: Medinsky stated that Kiev's proposals will be reviewed by Moscow and presented to President Vladimir Putin. The Russian side will also come up with a list of counter-proposals to Ukraine.  Over the course of the previous rounds of talks, the Russian and Ukrainian delegations managed to agree on humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from Ukrainian cities where the country\u2019s military and nationalist battalions were fighting troops of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and  LPR), as well as Russian forces taking part in the special military operation. However, Kiev and neo-Nazi regiments have repeatedly sabotaged the evacuation process.  The Russian special op was launched on 24 February in response to an appeal from the DPR and LPR to defend them against continued attacks by Kiev's forces.

The footage taken from a drone shows trenches and craters near a runway, as well as bas-reliefs with mosaic of Lenin's mausoleum inside a terminal with broken windows, and a demolished control tower. This comes as Mariupol is gradually coming under the control of Russian troops and forces of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). The Russian Defence Ministry said last week that the humanitarian situation in Mariupol had reached catastrophic proportions due to Ukrainian nationalist battalions, who do not want to lay down their arms and prevent tens of thousands of civilians from leaving the city. On 24 February, Moscow launched a special military operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine after weeks of escalating shelling, sabotage, and sniper attacks by Ukrainian forces against the Donbass republics, whose predominantly Russian-speaking population has been subjected to \"abuse and genocide [\u2026] for eight years\", according to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Moscow has repeatedly stated that the goal of the operation is to neutralise Ukraine's military capacity and not harm the civilian population of the country. In April 2014, Mariupol was the second-largest city in DPR after Donetsk, but in June of that year, the Ukrainian security forces regained control of the area. On 7 March 2022, Alexander Semyonov, deputy commander of the DPR's Vostok battalion, said that the cleansing of some of Mariupol's districts from Ukrainian forces and nationalist battalions, including the Azov Regiment, had begun as part of the Russian special operation.

He added that it was also revealed that a pharmaceutical company contracted by the Pentagon worked with the Ukrainian Defence Ministry to develop tests of unregistered medicines on Ukrainian military personnel. The remarks came after Igor Kirillov, the head of radiation, chemical, and biological defence of the Russian Armed Forces, said earlier this month that the total amount of US funding for military biological work carried out in the laboratories of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence amounted to $32 million. In a separate development, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that Russia will demand explanations about the involvement of the son of US President Joe Biden, Hunter, in financing biological laboratories in Ukraine that were tracked by Russian forces in the course of their ongoing special military operation in the country. The Russian Defence Ministry previously said that Hunter Biden\u2019s investment fund was participating in financing the Pentagon\u2019s military-biological programme in Ukraine.

After initially responding in the negative, Biden returned thirty seconds later and clarified: \"I think he is a war criminal\".","content":"White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that Biden \"was speaking from his heart and speaking from what he's seen on television\" when he accused President Putin of committing unspecified war crimes. However, media outlets, even including those which have been largely sympathetic to the official US perspective on Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, like the Associated Press, have expressed doubts about the value of such rhetoric. As the article's author points out, declaring someone a war criminal is not as simple as just saying the words, and there are set definitions and processes for determining who's a war criminal and how they should be punished. The exact definition of \"war criminal\" continues to be hotly contested. Any prosecution of such claims would likely take place under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, but neither the US, Ukraine, nor Russia is a signatory to the 1998 Rome Statute which established the body. Nonetheless, on 2 March, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced he was launching an investigation into allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide committed in Ukraine. The investigation will cover the events that have transpired since 21 November 2013, the first day of protests which would morph into the right-wing US-backed \"Maidan\" coup d'\u00e9tat of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych that ultimately resulted in the deaths of over 14,000 people. On 4 March, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution calling for the establishment of a commission of inquiry tasked with \"investigating all alleged rights violations and abuses, and related crimes, and making recommendations on accountability measures\", according to UN News. Beyond questions of legal jurisdiction, the history of many of the governments currently accusing Russia of war crimes points to another potential problem, however. There are a number of offences that have been carried out by US and NATO forces over the past three decades that were also televised and which, using similar logic, would likely fall under the ICC definition of \"war crimes\". Officials close to the current US administration are implicated in many \u2014 in 1998, for example, the bombing of the Al Shifa factory in Khartoum, which produced over half of Sudan's pharmaceutical products, and which was \"taken out on the direct orders of Bill Clinton\", according to Jacobin. Other well-documented NATO transgressions have frequently gone under the radar in the West, and those rare corporate outlets which do acknowledge them often paint the attacks as \"claims\" or something their victims merely \"say\" happened.  \"NATO Bomb Said to Hit Belgrade Hospital\", read a Washington Post headline when the Dr Dragisa Misovic Hospital was reduced to rubble just two weeks after a US B-2 bomber carried out an airstrike on the nearby Chinese Embassy, killing three officials and injuring over 20. Seven people killed in a NATO airstrike on a Zliten hospital were reduced to a \"Qaddafi Government Accusation\" in a headline from US state-funded Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty. More recently, in a military operation under the leadership of then-Vice President Joe Biden, a US airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Afghanistan on 3 October 2015, killed 30 medical staff and patients. A subsequent Doctors Without Borders inquiry found the \"US knew site was safe from Taliban* but bombed it anyway\", as one headline from The Independent put it. The deadly attack on health workers was closely followed up by the bombing of the Abs Rural Hospital in Yemen on 15 August 2016, when US-manufactured Paveway-series aerial bombs were dropped by the Saudi-led, US\/UK-backed coalition in what Amnesty international called \"the fourth attack in 10 months on a [Doctors Without Borders] facility in Yemen\". US and UK involvement in the ongoing Saudi siege of Yemen, which UN experts estimate has killed 377,000 civilians \u2014 70% under the age of five \u2014 has largely gone unmentioned amid widespread Western allegations of Russian \"war crimes\". But the Biden administration's insistence that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a \"war criminal\" faces another serious hurdle internationally \u2013 Biden's own complicity in the bloody US war in Iraq that saw millions of Iraqis killed over the course of two decades \"Joe Biden did so much more than vote for the war\", according to University of Illinois\u2013Chicago history professor Dr Barbara Ransby, in a recent mini-documentary narrated by Danny Glover, \"Worth the Price? Joe Biden and the Launch of the Iraq War\". \"It's questionable whether the authorisation to start the war could have even passed Congress without all that Biden did to get it approved\", she explained. \"He really did play a major role in bringing us into the Iraq War\u2026 He bears much more responsibility than many other senators who simply voted for it\".

It also wants neighboring countries to provide logistical support to its armed forces by treating its wounded and repairing its damaged military hardware.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."},{"uuid":"acc9ce35-a478-40e5-a1a7-dbd3646999c5","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220321\/oil-embargo-would-hit-energy-balance-in-europe-kremlin-warns-1094045658.html","title":"Oil Embargo Would Hit Energy Balance in Europe, Kremlin Warns","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e6\/03\/15\/1094046449_0:0:3072:2048_1440x900_80_0_1_111c023e2aea9123a405ea5205ad5d1f.jpg?source-sid=reuters_photo","subtitle":"Earlier this month, US President Joe Biden announced a ban on all energy imports from Russia, as part of the White House's sanctions on Moscow over its ongoing special military operation in Ukraine.","content":"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has warned that \"everyone\", including Europe, would be hit hard in the event of an embargo on Russian oil.

The new requirement concerns countries that have imposed sanctions against Russia over its military operation in Ukraine.On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said \u201cunfriendly countries\u201d would continue to receive Russian natural gas in volumes and prices fixed in contracts, but are now to pay for the commodity in the country\u2019s national currency. In Asia, these countries include Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, which import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Russia\u2019s Sakhalin-2 and Yamal LNG projects.Commenting on the development, Japanese Finance Minister Shun\u2019ichi Suzuki said that Tokyo is confused about Russia\u2019s demand.\u201cFrankly speaking, we do not yet fully understand the goals and how this will be carried out\u2026 the government is currently in discussions with the responsible ministries and agencies to assess the situation,\u201d Suzuki stated.Japan is the biggest importer of Russian LNG in Asia, purchasing 6.84 million tons of liquefied gas from the country in 2021, according to Refinitiv data, which is nearly 9% of its total LNG imports.Suzuki noted that Tokyo\u2019s decisions regarding further sanctions against Moscow will be made with consideration to their possible impact on the Japanese economy and financial markets. A number of the country\u2019s major gas suppliers told Reuters they have not received notifications on changes to the currency of payment yet.Meanwhile, South Korea, Asia\u2019s third-largest importer of Russian LNG, said it expects to be able to continue imports. The South Korean Financial Services Commission said it would do whatever was necessary to facilitate further trade with Russia.Taiwan also said it has so far received \u201cno news that the payment system will be adjusted.\u201d The country\u2019s upcoming gas shipment from Russia is due at the end of the month.Analysts say Russia\u2019s call for payments in rubles is a way to support the national currency, which plunged to record lows amid Ukraine-related sanctions.

The inhumane acts are often attributed to nationalist and Neo-Nazi groups.","content":"\"Probably as any sane person, I'm simply terrified to see these horrors \u2013 in terms of lynching people, kicking them, trying to somehow smash their identity through tying them to the lampposts and painting their faces in the colour of the Ukrainian flag,\" says Adriel Kasonta, a London-based foreign affairs analyst and former chairman of the International Affairs Committee at the Bow Group think tank. \"This is terrifying, that is beyond any human being\u2019s dignity, it's really terrifying to see these pictures.\" Many reported atrocities are being committed by Ukrainian nationalists and the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion. Being incorporated into the National Guard in 2014 the group is subordinate to the Ukrainian authorities. The Azov Battalion, which openly wears the neo-Nazi Wolfsangel insignia, is notorious for attacking and displacing residents in eastern Ukraine, as well as raping and torturing detainees in Donbass, according to a 2016 UN report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OCHA). Incidents involving taping and whipping of Ukrainian civilians occur in areas where Ukrainian nationalists are most active: particularly, in Kharkov, Lvov, Cherkassy, and Dnepropetrovsk. Civilians are tied to electric poles or trees with tape, sometimes their faces are smeared with paint or green antiseptic dye, they are whipped and left in the cold. Photos of the victims and footage of the punishment are widely shared on social media networks. Among those targeted are the Roma people, one of Ukraine's ethnic minorities. One photo shows a Roma family, including children, being tied to a pole with their faces painted with green dye in the city of Lvov. There is no evidence that these people committed crimes, nor is there any provision in Ukrainian legislation authorising the use of such brutal methods of punishment. The Western mainstream media either remains silent about the ongoing arbitrariness or tries to portray the instances of the human rights abuse as local civilians' efforts to fight \"looters and bandits by themselves.\" However, the discovery of a torture chamber in the basement of a building previously occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the village of Kryakovka, Lugansk region, tells another story. \"In this basement there was, so to speak, an impromptu torture chamber, from where we took a local resident tormented to death,\" said Lugansk People's Republic militia serviceman. \"There are traces of blood on the floor. Judging by the state of the body, he was shot in the head during the retreat.\" Yet another infamous torture site codenamed \"Library\" was located in the International Airport of Mariupol, the Donetsk region. Documentary evidence indicated that the site belonged to the Azov Battalion. Those who disagreed with the policies of the Ukrainian authorities after the 2014 coup were detained, tortured and even killed there. \"It is astonishing and saddened that these facts are not loudly condemned by the various humanitarian NGOs in the West,\" says Tiberio Graziani, chairman at Vision &amp; Global Trends, International Institute for Global Analyses. However, according to Kasonta, everyone in the West is perfectly aware of what is happening in Ukraine and how Ukrainian nationalists, the Azov Battalion, and violent mobs are treating regular citizens and ethnic minorities in Ukraine. Racism and xenophobia have long penetrated into the fabric of Ukrainian society, according to the analyst. Thus, it comes as no surprise that African students were turned back by Ukrainian border guards while attempting to cross into Poland. \u201cThey stopped us at the border and told us that Blacks were not allowed. But we could see White people going through,\u201d a Guinea student recalled as quoted by France 24 on 28 February. Meanwhile, the nationalist agenda became part of the Ukrainian education system. According to Ukrainian outlet STRANA.ua, the nationalist projects received up to half of all the funds allocated by the Ukrainian government for children's and youth organisations in 2020 alone. In March 2014, CNN admitted that \"far-right, anti-Semitic, anti-Russian, and openly fascist groups have existed and do exist as a blight on modern Ukraine.\" Two years earlier the European Parliament's resolution denounced \"the rising nationalistic sentiment in Ukraine.\" The Guardian quoted the Azov commander, Andriy Biletsky, as saying in 2010 that \"Ukraine's mission was to \"lead the white races of the world in a final crusade\u2026against Semite-led Untermenschen [subhumans].\" While human rights have been weaponised and monopolised by the West, \"now the so-called human rights watchers are blind to the fact that human rights are being violated in Ukraine by Ukrainians, they are only concentrated on alleged crimes committed against Ukrainians by Russians,\" according to the foreign affairs analyst. \"This is very disturbing because it shows that the double standard is very clear, that we are not living in a world where we can objectively condemn someone, if someone is committing human rights violations,\" he says. \"But we are only supposed to condemn those who are labelled by the United States or the collective West as the human rights violators. This is not human rights, if human rights and international law are used arbitrarily by one state to condemn its enemies, then the international law or law at large is not serving its purpose. This is the double standard.\" Regardless of Kiev's dark record of human rights abuses and xenophobia, the EU \u2013 which applauded Black Lives Matter anti-racism marches in summer 2020 \u2013 is backing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski's bid for membership stressing that \"Ukraine belongs to our European family.\" "},{"uuid":"acfc445a-6561-455c-a9f8-04bb20b7031a","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/sport\/552649-johnson-russia-ukraine-euros\/","title":"British PM scores own goal with Ukraine Euro backing","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623cbe8085f5404a3b39a34d.jpg","subtitle":"The UK prime minister claimed Russia's bid to host Euro 2028 or 2032 was 'beyond satire'","content":"UK leader Boris Johnson claims Russia's potential bid to host the European Championships is\u00a0\"beyond satire\" while backing Ukraine to receive the UEFA tournament despite his country and Ireland launching a joint effort to host the event in 2028.Along with Turkey, Russia lodged a declaration of interest in hosting the continental tournament in 2028 or 2032, which was announced and recognized by European governing body UEFA on Wednesday.\u00a0On Thursday while attending a Brussels NATO summit addressing Russia's military operation in Ukraine, Johnson claimed that \"the idea of Russia holding any idea of football tournament or any kind of cultural event right now is beyond satire.\u00a0\"I can\u2019t believe that anybody would seriously consider their suggestion and, yes, I think the best thing possible would be for the entire Russian forces to retire forthwith from Ukraine and hand the tournament to them,\" Johnson added, when responding to a question as to whether it would be more suitable for Ukraine to host the Euros.Some pointed out that Johnson seemed to have forgotten about the UK and Ireland's joint hosting bid for Euro 2028, which was previously believed to be unchallenged before Russia and Turkey threw their hats into the ring.\u00a0This came despite Johnson tweeting on Wednesday from his official account that \"the UK and Ireland bid for the UEFA Euro 2028 has this government\u2019s full backing\".\"Our world-class stadiums and passionate fans stand ready to host one of the world\u2019s greatest sporting events.

US President Joe Biden this month acknowledged that domestic inflation is a direct consequence of the west\u2019s economic retaliation against Russia. A UK parliamentary committee warned on Wednesday that the British public wasn\u2019t immune to the economic consequences of sanctions against Russia. The concerns of inflation and effect on markets are even more pressing in the developing economies like India and China. Both the Hang Seng (Hong Kong) and the Shanghai Composite Indices dropped to a 20-month low this month on account of the uncertainty created by the Ukrainian crisis. Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar warned in Parliament this month that the \u201cUkraine conflict has major economic implications.\u201d \u201cIts impact on energy and commodity prices is already visible. The disruption of the global supply chain is expected to be significant,\u201d stated Jaishankar. Sputnik caught up with eminent Indian economist Dr Arun Kumar, who is presently the Malcolm S. Adiseshiah Chair Professor at the Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi. Kumar has also taught economics at India\u2019s premier Jawaharlal Nehru University for over three decades until 2015. Sputnik: How effective, in your view, are the western sanctions against Russia? Will Russia be able to weather these western sanctions? Dr Arun Kumar: One must look at the effects of these economic sanctions in the short, medium and long-term. When one looks at the immediate impacts, the open global economic architecture, which involves trade and financial transactions, has been disrupted. In the immediate aftermath of these western sanctions, we saw the Russian currency rouble trading at a lower value, Moscow Stock Exchange dropping as well as reports of shortages of certain products in the Russian market. Importantly enough, Russian energy exports, including oil and natural gas, have been kept out of these sanctions. It is clear by now that the European Union (EU) can\u2019t do without Russian oil and gas. Then, we have the possibility of China increasing its energy purchases from Russia in the near-future, since it has a massive requirement. In the case of India, we are seeing that even it has taken up offers of cheaper crude offered by Russia. I also don\u2019t see Moscow facing any balance-of-payments crisis due to these sanctions in the future. At the same time, Russia\u2019s trade account surplus will also enable it meet to weather these sanctions without much difficulty. Then, if one looks at the freezing of Russian Central Bank\u2019s overseas funds, a point to note is the current trade account surplus enjoyed by Moscow. Technically, the central bank will continue to accrue interest due to this trade account surplus. Lastly, the western companies who are threatening to leave Russia can\u2019t withdraw their capital or dissolve their holdings easily. A big question for the western companies would be to find buyers for their stake in order to leave Russia (The Moscow Stock Exchage is all set to re-open for trading on 24 March). Sputnik: Could these sanctions also prove to be counter-productive for the west as well as affect other nations? Dr Kumar: Russia has been a major global supplier of oil and natural gas, fertilisers as well as critical minerals such as palladium and nickel (used as an ingredient in stainless steel).  We are already witnessing anxiety among commodity traders and market analysts who have been anticipating rise in prices of fertilisers, energy as well as certain minerals such as palladium. I also envisage serious bottlenecks emerging in global supply chains due to disruptions caused by these sanctions. Another implication would be that developing nations like India will increasingly feel the pressure of joining either of the bloc.  Sputnik: Will the global economic growth suffer? Could we expect a rise in inflation? Dr Kumar: The factors that I have mentioned\u2014shortage of raw materials, increased prices and supply side disruptions\u2014will lead to inflation across the world in the short to medium term. Inflation means that the purchasing power parity (PPP) of households will also take a hit. These factors have the potential to affect the growth rate across major world economies. Sputnik: How would India be affected in these emerging economic realities? Dr Kumar: There will be inflation in all the major economies in at least the short-term and India is no exception (The Indian government marginally increased the fuel prices on 22 March after a gap of 137 days on back of record-high crude benchmark costs). But, then, one must take into account the role of speculators in driving up prices. Even though India is well-placed in terms of stockpiles, the domestic speculators are bound to speculate on the commodities market as a result of global food shortages. The government must remain alert to check the level of speculation on the Indian market in order to prevent the prices from rising. Sputnik: How can India respond to the economic crisis? Dr Kumar: As a response to the global economic effects, the best option for India will be to continue staying neutral, since it has major commercial dealings with both Russia and the US. With Russia, there is a strong defence component to the relationship that\u2019s crucial for New Delhi. But a major challenge for Russia to sustain these economic ties with India would be how China views these relations between Moscow and New Delhi. If there is any Chinese pressure on Russia in the future as a result of increased economic reliance of Moscow on Beijing is what one has to wait and watch. However, India is also a major partner for America, at least as far as the Indo-Pacific region is concerned. One can expect increased pressure from the west on India to draw down its defence and other commercial ties with Moscow, as we are already seeing now. Sputnik: What are your thoughts about the prospect of establishing a rupee-rouble trading mechanism between Russia and India? How feasible is the proposal, should India want to deepen its energy and commercial ties with Moscow? Dr Kumar: The rupee-rouble trading mechanism had been in existence previously (during the Cold War era). We can carry out trade in our own currencies by choosing a reference point. Now, the complexity involved is in choosing the reference currency. Another factor here would be about the relative strength of rouble in non-dollar denominators, since the rouble may further drop vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar.  So, both the countries will have to develop a parity in non-dollar denominators in order to re-engage in rupee-rouble mechanism.

It\u2019s not immediately clear where the Ukrainian National Guard got its figures from to create its graphic. In 2018, the United States, France and the UK launched more than 100 air and cruise missiles at Syria in the aftermath of a false-flag chemical attack in Douma. A year before that, the United States launched 59 Tomahawk missiles into Syria at an airbase, \u201cin response to\u201d a separate staged chemical attack blamed on the Syrian government. The US-led anti-Daesh coalition in Iraq and Syria has expended nearly 120,500 missiles and bombs over the two countries, 15,184 of them over the past five years, and 554 in the first year of the Biden presidency.

Russian UN Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya announced in late February that 12 employees of the Russian mission had been ordered to leave the United States by 7 March. Before that, the State Department moved to expel Sergei Trepelkov, Russia's second-ranking diplomat in Washington. Trepelkov was expelled after Russia kicked out US Embassy second-in-command Bart Gorman in response to the expulsion of yet another Russian diplomat from Washington. The US and Russian governments have engaged in tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats going back to the crisis in Ukraine in 2014. The practice was also common during the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union in the 20th century. Commenting on the Russian expulsion notice later Wednesday, State Department spokesman Ned Price said that the US Embassy serves as a \"locus of coordination and communication\" between the two countries, and that Washington does not want to see it \"closed down.\" Russian-US relations hit a lowpoint unseen since the deepest depths of the Cold War last month after Moscow began a military operation in Ukraine aimed at \"demilitarizing\" the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead on the operation after weeks of escalating shelling, sniper and sabotage attacks by Ukrainian forces against the self-proclaimed Donbass republics, whose sovereignty Russia recognized on 21 February. The fighting in Ukraine is the culmination of a security crisis which began eight years ago, when US and EU-backed political forces overthrew Ukraine's unpopular but democratically elected government and proceeded to try to drag the heavily divided nation into the West's orbit. The coup in Kiev prompted Crimean authorities to organize a referendum on the peninsula's status, and sparked a civil conflict in the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk which effectively continues to this day.

Mizintsev referred to the many statements of innocent civilians who fled the city, telling of how members of the Ukrainian nationalist voluntary battalions stand behind their fellow civilians while they fire their weapons at the Russian and Donbass soldiers. Mizintsev added that \"all [testimony] will be investigated in detail.\" Mizintsev continued that Kiev had ordered those national battalions to leave Mariupol in small groups under the guise of civilians, after Ukraine refused the offer to conduct a humanitarian operation in the city, declaring that it would never surrender to the Russian army. Russia launched a special military operation on February 24 in Ukraine as a response to pleas for protection from soldiers of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics. The special military operation, which is only targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure and not civilians, aims to \"demilitarize and denazify\" Ukraine, according to statements released by the Russian Defense Ministry.

agricultural raw materials, a temporary increase in production thresholds, supporting sustainable food production in the most vulnerable countries, and creating a mechanism which would enable providing them with agricultural products \u201cin sufficient quantity and at reasonable prices,\u201d if such necessity arises.Food security was discussed on Thursday by other leaders as well, including US President Joe Biden.Macron has been warning about the global food crisis for some time and recently announced some domestic measures poised to mitigate the consequences of military action in Ukraine.Stressing that Ukraine and Russia \u201care true barns for the international food supply,\u201d Macron, who is facing the election on April 10, said that he planned to introduce food vouchers to help \u201cthe most modest households and the middle classes to face these additional costs.\u201d However, the details of a food support program are yet to be revealed.Russia and Ukraine

Increases in food and fuel prices \u201cwill affect the most vulnerable in developing countries, putting pressure on the poorest households which spend the highest share of their income on food, resulting in hardship and hunger,\u201d the organization warned.Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements and end the conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.

The price of these sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia, it\u2019s imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well.\" \"At the end of the day, America and Europe will feel the pain of deprivation from energy, minerals and food,\" says US independent journalist and geopolitical analyst Max Parry. \"Americans have not even begun to feel the true financial effects of the sanctions on Russia and their impact on the US economy which was already ravaged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inflation has been at a rate not seen since the Eighties and supply chain shortages were hurting America's pocketbooks. But now the Biden administration has just poured gasoline onto the fire by placing the most draconian sanctions ever on the Russian Federation which is one of the top world suppliers of fossil fuels as well as base metals that are indispensable to global industrial output.\" Now US business owners also have the perfect excuse to blame rising prices on consumer goods, according to Parry. Similarly, the Biden administration is clearly trying to use the Ukraine crisis as an excuse for its poor handling of the American economy, he notes. At the same time, it is difficult to understand the motivations and inner logic of the foreign policy establishment in Washington especially when you consider that sanctions have seldom resulted in the desired outcome at any time in history, according to the analyst. To illustrate his point, Parry cites the fact that western sanctions, slapped on Moscow since 2014, failed to reverse Crimea's reunification with Russia and to prevent Russia \"from continuing to return to the world stage and stand up for its own interests\". Likewise, he says, the US' \"maximum pressure\" on Iran and oil embargo on Venezuela have not resulted in regime change or stopped those nations from integrating with Russia and China's economic infrastructure. It's unclear what the western sanctions are designed to achieve apart from \"making Russia bleed\": the restrictions do not appear to be aimed at halting the conflict as the US and its NATO allies are continuing to send lethal weapons to Ukraine while Moscow is locked in peace negotiations with Kiev. According to US observers, the ongoing weaponry supplies and controversial speculation about putting US boots in Ukraine makes Kiev less willing to negotiate and reach a compromise. Little if any support has been voiced by the West with regard to Moscow's peace effort. The latest progress in the Russo-Ukrainian Istanbul talks was immediately thrown into doubt by the western press, and the Pentagon rushed to express scepticism about Russia's military de-escalation near Kiev. \"Nothing has changed, Russia is just buying time with negotiations,\" claimed CNBC. What stuns Max Parry is that the American Left are not challenging the US mainstream narrative and largely turning a blind eye to the potential negative consequences of anti-Russia sanctions for ordinary Americans. Parry notes that the only Democrats to vote against the US' Russia oil embargo were Cori Bush and Ilhan Omar. Moreover, those Democrats who dare to speak against the established narrative get smeared immediately: \"Just look at the way former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard became persona non grata,\" the journalist notes. New York Representative Jamaal Bowman voted against sending more lethal aid to Ukraine and now is suddenly going to face a primary challenger who is a Kosovar Albanian-American legislator that is extremely pro-NATO, according to Parry. \"Unfortunately, there really is no political opposition to represent the interests of the American people on Capitol Hill when it comes to rapprochement with Russia,\" he says. \"Instead, lawmakers only ensure that the defence industry will continue to make huge profits off tensions between the two countries. Sure, some of them may have voted against additional military aid to Ukraine but when they've even shown any slight deviation from the anti-Russian orthodoxy they open themselves up to attack and risk their political career.\" "},{"uuid":"b184ad90-25fe-4f10-a45a-d349138c86a8","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552334-ukraine-mariupol-school-bombing\/?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=Email","title":"Ukraine accuses Russia of bombing Mariupol school","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/62373d7e2030277cfd005dc5.jpg","subtitle":"Multiple people are trapped under rubble, local authorities believe","content":"Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of hitting a school located in the besieged city of Mariupol.

Speaking in Sunset, Louisiana on Monday, Harris mentioned \u201cthe significance of the passage of time\u201d four times in the space of thirty seconds. Harris\u2019 comments immediately went viral, amassing over 4.5 million views on a GOP-affiliated Twitter account and tens of thousands more on others. Sensing red meat, Republicans had a field day attacking Harris in a series of sarcastic ways. Former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich suggested Harris\u2019 appearances in public were a \u201cstrong reason\u201d to pray for President Biden\u2019s health, given that she\u2019s just one heartbeat away from the presidency. \u201cShe\u2019s not only totally incoherent \u2013 you know, he may or may not have cognitive decline problems at this age, but at her age, she\u2019s just dumb\u201d, Gingrich said. The politician suggested that Harris should be barred from trips abroad, and that she should consider \u201cnever leaving the Naval Observatory\u201d \u2013 her formal vice presidential residence, to avoid embarrassing the administration. Former Republican Senate aide Matt Whitlock compared Harris\u2019 performance to HBO\u2019s political cringe comedy show VEEP, suggesting that her comments were \u201cthe most VEEP thing we\u2019ve seen in at least a few weeks\u201d and tweeting a clip of the vice president\u2019s comments overlaid with the show\u2019s credits. \u201cIs she actually drunk?\u201d one podcaster asked. \u201cKamala Harris Fact: The Passage of Time is Slower When You\u2019re High\u201d, another joker quipped. The Louisiana speech isn\u2019t the first time that Harris has been called out for her awkward, rambling and incoherent remarks. Last week, she raised eyebrows after laughing uncontrollably at a press conference with the Polish president after being asked a question about the crisis in Ukraine. Before that, when asked to break down the crisis in simple terms on an Atlanta radio show, Harris used her von Clausewitzian wit to explain that \u201cUkraine is a country in Europe\u201d that \u201cexists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine so basically that\u2019s wrong\u201d. Harris\u2019 gaffes, goofs, and slips have become so commonplace that entire compilations have been created online. The vice president\u2019s approval rating dropped to a historically unprecedented low of 28 percent in November, behind even that of Dan Quayle and Dick Cheney at their lowest points. Harris has accused the media and Republicans of treating her with excessive scrutiny because of her race and gender. Biden selected Harris as his running mate in August 2020. Harris herself dropped out of the campaign in December 2019, before any primaries or caucuses were held, and received zero delegates for the Democratic nomination.

(OVL), with a 20% stake in the Sakhalin-1 project, has sold crude oil to state refiners Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) in a fresh tender issued by the company last week. This is the first time HPCL and BPCL have purchased Sokol crude from Russia. Sources in New Delhi told Sputnik that the firms secured the cargo at a discounted price. The payment will be made in Indian rupees to the OVL. The Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL), the country's largest refiner, purchased six million barrels of Russian Urals in March alone. Moscow has offered a roughly 30% discount compared to international prices. Industry sources also told Sputnik that Nayara Energy, the country's second-largest refiner, has placed an order to purchase 1.8 million barrels of Russian crude oil. The delivery is expected in May this year. \"India has to keep focusing on the competitive energy source\", the Indian government conveyed last week. Sources also told Sputnik that a detailed discussion between the two countries related to a rupee-ruble payment mechanism would be held during Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's visit to New Delhi later this week. The rupee-ruble mechanism will boost energy ties between the two countries, as Russia could start offering steel-making and thermal coal at discounted rates. The Reserve Bank of India met three Russian banks \u2014 Sberbank, VTB, and Gazprom Bank \u2014 and more such meetings with officials of these banks will be held this week. Western sanctions against Russia for its special military operation to demilitarise and \"de-Nazify\" Ukraine have hit Russian energy sales, resulting in deep discount offers to energy buyers such as China and India that are not following the unilateral sanctions. India and China have called for an end to the violence in Ukraine and urged that the Ukrainian issue be solved diplomatically. The Biden administration said on 14 March that New Delhi would not be violating US sanctions by purchasing discounted Russian oil, but warned that \"support for the Russian leadership is support for an invasion that obviously is having a devastating impact\".

Since Russia and Ukraine are key crop suppliers in the world, the G7 leaders have blamed Moscow\u2019s offensive in Ukraine for a looming crisis and are now discussing a package of measures to prevent food shortages.Nevertheless, in Putin\u2019s opinion, the West continues to make decisions that \u201care pushing the global economy towards crisis,\u201d leading to the disruption of production and logistics chains, an increase in global inflation, and the aggravation of inequality, to a decline in the living standards of millions of people, and to mass famine in the poorest countries.\u00a0Putin accused the US of trying to solve its own problems at the expense of other countries and to shift the blame for its own economic mistakes onto Russia. Moreover, in the president\u2019s opinion, the US is going to try to cash in on the current global instability, for example, by attempting \u201cto push Europe towards expensive American liquid natural gas.\u201dPutin added that all the sanctions which are being imposed on Moscow now \u201chave been prepared in advance\u201d and \u201cwould have been imposed in any case.\u201d They are poised, according to the president, \u201cto curb Russia\u2019s development,\u201d to undermine its sovereignty and to weaken its \u201cindustrial, financial and technological potential.\u201dTaking into consideration the fact that the West has been imposing the restrictions against Russia for many years, there is no point thinking that this approach would change any time soon, Putin emphasized.The West strongly condemned Russia\u2019s military attack on Ukraine, calling it \u201cunlawful\u201d and \u201cunjustified,\u201d and slapped Moscow with hard-hitting sanctions, covering many sectors of the Russian economy. The restrictions include Washington\u2019s ban on energy imports, an international ban for the use of the SWIFT interbank messaging system, and personal sanctions against Putin. Hundreds of companies have suspended or completely halted their operations in Russia.\u00a0In response, Moscow has included most of the Western countries in its list of \u201cunfriendly states.\u201d All of these countries are now subject to various retaliation measures, restrictions, and specific requirements from Russia. For example, Moscow now wants all \u201cunfriendly\u201d states to pay for gas supplies in rubles. Another retaliatory initiative saw the Finance Ministry requesting that Russian companies that want to work with firms from countries on the list receive government permission first.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

According to the outlet's sources, Academy decision-makers are still deciding how Zelensky would appear on the show to address the audience and the world. It was also unclear to sources whether he would appear live or use a pre-recorded message. However, most observers of the conflict suggest that Zelensky would opt for a live video address.  The news comes as the age-old discussion again revolves in Hollywood about whether art should remain out of politics amid events taking place in the world and particularly, in Ukraine. Show broadcaster ABC is thought to support having Zelensky speak. It is also expected that Mila Kunis, a Ukrainian-born actress who donated $35 million for Ukrainian migrants alongside her husband, Ashton Kutcher, are reportedly expected to make an address during the awards presentation. The contributions of Kutcher and Kunis have been acknowledged by Zelensky. The Ukrainian president posted a tweeted an image of himself in a Zoom meeting with the couple on on Sunday. The Academy has been tight-lipped about how it will weigh in on the crisis. Earlier this week, the show\u2019s executive producer, Will Packer, reportedly told media that in such a \"time in humankind history\" it would be the right move to \"find a way to respectfully acknowledge where we are and how fortunate we are to even be able to put on this show.\" Last week, when the Ukrainian president addressed the Israeli Knesset, he reportedly tried to speak to the hearts of people, finding similarities between Russia's special military operation in Ukraine and the actions of the Nazis in World War II. Zelensky stated that the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin was pursuing a \"final solution\" against Ukraine and asked for assistance from Israel, just as the Ukrainians \"came to the rescue\" of Jews 80 years ago. Some Israeli politicians, including the country's prime minister, did not appreciate the comparison of the special military operation in Ukraine to the Holocaust, which killed at least six million Jews. Others commented to Zelensky that Ukrainian nationalist collaborators actively cooperated with the Nazi regime and were directly involved in acts of the extermination of Jews. A week prior, in a virtual address to the US Congress, Zelensky referenced Martin Luther King Jr.'s iconic \"I have a dream\" speech, asking lawmakers to instate a no-fly zone over Ukraine. This move to reach out to the hearts of lawmakers by citing the iconic American caused some criticism in the country, as Washington is generally opposed to the move, with some exceptions. Others have suggested that instituting a no-fly zone over Ukraine would cause the start of World War III. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

The firm managed around $1.3 trillion in assets at the time of the last financial crisis, which soared to $8.68 trillion in January 2021, and passed the\u00a0$10 trillion mark this January.\u00a0BlackRock\u2019s top executives have been rewarded by the Biden administration too, and have helped shape its economic policies. Brian Deese served as the global head of sustainable investing at BlackRock, and now directs the National Economic Council. Wally Adeyemo is a former senior adviser at BlackRock, and now serves as deputy secretary of the Treasury Department. Mike Pyle used to be an investment strategist at BlackRock, and now serves as Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 chief economic adviser.The firm has grabbed headlines in recent years for\u00a0buying up properties throughout the US and turning them over to the rental market. Although the UN has\u00a0criticized BlackRock\u2019s former owner, Blackstone, for \u201cwreaking havoc with tenants\u2019 right to security and contributing to the global housing crisis,\u201d BlackRock has been hired by the US government to buy up mortgages on its behalf, bringing even more properties under its management.Americans are expected to bear the brunt of the inflation Kapito warned about in the immediate term. According to\u00a0estimates published by Bloomberg on Tuesday, the average US household will have to spend an extra $5,200 this year for the same basket of consumer goods.

Speaking at a \"Save America\" rally of his supporters in Commerce, Georgia, on Saturday, the 45th American president berated the Biden administration over the Ukraine crisis, high inflation, and soaring gasoline prices, slamming at some point of his speech NBC journo Chuck Todd as a \"sleepy son\u00ad-of-a-b**ch\".  Trump has repeatedly described Todd, moderator of NBC News's Meet the Press programme, as \u201csleepy\u201d, also slamming NBC as \u201cfake\u201d news channel. Trump has had a longstanding feud with NBC News and Todd, whom he considered to be biased against his administration. The 45th president first used the word in April 2017, when he questioned why Todd and NBC News were not covering his claim that the Obama administration illegally spied on his campaign. \"When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and NBC News start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump\/Russia story?\" Trump tweeted at the time. It remains unclear why the former US president singled out the moniker during the Commerce rally. He then went further by asserting that the US president \"has been one train wreck after another\" and accusing Biden of \"disgracing\" the nation with \"his humiliating surrender in Afghanistan\" and skyrocketing inflation, which is the \"highest in over 40 years\". Trump also pointed the finger at Biden over soaring gas prices, the migration gridlock, and Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. Trump argued that \"[the] Ukraine [crisis] would've never happened\" had he been president of the US now. According to him, America currently has \"a president that has no idea what the hell he's doing and has no idea even where he is. The fake news, they're trying to say he's acting brilliantly [\u2026]\". The remarks followed the 45th president accusing Biden of failing to tackle Russia's special military operation in Ukraine due to Washington's concern over Moscow's nuclear potential. He told a rally of his supporters in Florida last week that POTUS is now afraid of attacking a \"nuclear power\", in an apparent reference to Russia, and yet again trotting out his claim that on his watch, the Ukraine crisis would have never taken place, alleging that Moscow's special operation came after Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly saw Washington's \"weakness\". \"It was my personality that kept us out of war. I was the only president in four decades who did not get America into any conflicts, except I totally defeated ISIS [Daesh*]\", the former US president claimed. Moscow's special operation, which has been underway since 24 February, was launched after the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for help in defending themselves against Kiev's forces.  Russia said that the goal of the operation is to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine and that only the nation's military infrastructure is being targeted. The Kremlin has repeatedly stressed that it has no plans to occupy Ukraine. According to President Putin, the operation's goal is to protect the people of Donbass, \"who have been subjected to abuse, genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years\".

The response can be attributed to the negative attitude of the general population in the country towards the US and NATO, experts believe. \"Indeed, Indonesian public actively support the special military operation led by Russia in Ukraine,\" Vorobyova said. The ambassador noted that several factors account for this. Another critical aspect is the personal authority of the Russian president, according to the ambassador. \"The president\u2019s actions aimed at building a fair multipolar world are frequently compared in Indonesia to the politics of the first president of Indonesia Sukarno, who had an anti-west stance and did a lot to establish close relations with the USSR,\" the ambassador added. Moreover, for Indonesians, Russia serves as an example of a country on a path to reaching inter-ethnic and inter-faith harmony, Vorobyova stressed. \"We often see local news outlets extensively cover the development of Islam in Russia. In this context, the participation of the Russian Muslim military including those from the Chechen Republic is met with great approval,\" the official noted. On 24 February, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian provocations. In response to Russia\u2019s operation, Western countries have rolled out a comprehensive sanctions campaign against Moscow.

Leaders in Berlin have been less enthusiastic about sanctioning Russian energy than some of their EU counterparts, with Scholz describing Russia\u2019s energy as \u201cessential\u201d for the survival of Germany\u2019s economy, and Economy Minister Robert Habeck urging citizens this week to reduce their consumption amid the growing likelihood of rationing.Nevertheless, Germany has sent shipments of arms to Ukraine and backed EU sanctions on Russia.

This policy is set to come into effect on April 1, with Russia warning that those who refuse to comply will see their gas supply cut off.Scholz rejected Putin\u2019s gas-for-rubles demand last week, but Wednesday\u2019s call suggests a softening of his position. According to readouts from both sides, Scholz demanded written information explaining how the switchover would work, while Russia said that \u201cexperts of the two countries would discuss this issue further.\u201dAccording to Berlin, Putin told Scholz that payments could still be made in euros or dollars to Russia\u2019s Gazprombank, which is not subject to EU sanctions. Gazprombank would then convert the payments into rubles.\u201cScholz did not agree to this procedure in the conversation, but asked for written information to better understand the procedure,\u201d said a German spokesperson.Though the Group of Seven major Western economies have collectively agreed to reject Moscow\u2019s demand for payment in rubles, Putin has fielded calls from individual leaders whose countries are still dependent on Russian energy.

So, they moved all these threatening and dangerous activities to other countries,\u201d Lavrov claimed.\u201cMore and more they concentrate their research and experiments around the borders of the Russian Federation and China,\u201d he remarked.Lavrov was referring to biolabs funded by the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the existence of which was highlighted during Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine. The Russian military claims it has discovered evidence that the work in Ukrainian labs funded by the US Department of Defense had military applications.Washington has denied the claims, which had reiterated Russia\u2019s previous suspicions about research undertaken on foreign territory in return for American grants. The US government said the labs existed to study emerging infections throughout the world and served as an epidemic early warning system.US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland last week testified under oath that there were \u201cbiological research facilities in Ukraine,\u201d and that the US was assisting Kiev in destroying research materials so they would not get into Russia\u2019s hands.In his interview with RT, Lavrov said that, in his assessment, there were more than 300 biolabs worldwide involved in research for the Pentagon.

Last week the Federal Reserve increased its rates by 25 points, or 0.25%, raising the cost of borrowing from where it had sat near zero for the last three years to 0.5%. Fed officials predicted another six such increases over the remainder of 2022 and at least three in 2023.The Federal Reserve controls the short-term borrowing rate for commercial banks, which then pass this rate on to their customers. Higher rates make borrowing money less viable, which contracts the economy and lowers inflation. This method of reining in inflation was practiced most dramatically in the 1970s, when the Fed hiked interest rates to over 20% and stopped all bond purchases.Under both the Trump and Biden administrations, interest rates have been kept at rock bottom, while both presidents flooded the economy with money: Trump by overseeing the creation of a quarter of all the dollars ever created in 2020 and Biden by spending more in the first eight months of his presidency than Trump did in 2018 and 2019 combined, according to Fox News.Powell cautioned that readjusting the American economy downwards will not be a simple task. \u201cNo one expects that bringing about a soft landing will be straightforward in the current context,\u201d he said on Monday, adding: \u201cVery little is straightforward in the current context.\u201dMonetary policy \u2013 the discipline of economic management that interest manipulation falls under \u2013 is a \u201cblunt instrument, not capable of surgical precision,\u201d he continued, adding that \u201cMy colleagues and I will do our very best to succeed in this challenging task.\u201dCore inflation \u2013 a metric often cited by the Fed which excludes food and energy costs \u2013 rose 5.2% in January, the sharpest increase in 38 years when compared with the preceding January.

Far sharper increases in the cost of certain items, such as meat, have been reported by American shoppers, too.Once described by the Biden administration as \u201ctransitory,\u201d inflation has been compounded by coronavirus-related supply chain disruptions, and shocks to global energy, grain, and fertilizer markets following the outbreak of war in Ukraine.\u00a0"},{"uuid":"b4a14550-132c-4db1-b6f6-757441427210","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552335-ukraine-tv-marathon-policy\/","title":"Zelensky orders Ukrainian TV to conduct 'round-the-clock information marathon'","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623730db85f54023e066e9f7.jpg","subtitle":"Kiev has ordered the creation of a single \u201cmarathon\u201d channel","content":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a law introducing a \u201cunified information policy\u201d that provides for the merger of all national news TV channels into a single \u201cround-the-clock information marathon.\u201dCiting martial law, the decree signed by the leader\u00a0on March 19 says the goal is to combat \u201cactive dissemination of misinformation by the aggressor state (Russia).\u201dAccording to the text of the decision made by the Security and Defense Council, the unified information policy is necessary to \u201cto tell the truth about the war\u201d and is \u201ca priority issue of national security\u201d amid Moscow\u2019s ongoing military offensive.Martial law was introduced in Ukraine on February 24, the day Moscow launched its military attack against the country, and will be in force until at least the end of April.The new channel will be known as \u201cUnique News #UArazom,\u201d according to the decree.The council ordered the merger of \u201call national TV channels with broadcast grid consisting mainly of information\u201d and analytical programs into one round-the-clock information channel.

Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force."},{"uuid":"b4d8b2d2-7186-4d87-9692-910312b38dc5","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220319\/hundreds-of-bombs-planted-by-ukrainian-military-near-ports-may-drift-into-bosphorus-1094016449.html","title":"Hundreds of Bombs Planted by Ukrainian Military Near Ports May Drift Into Bosphorus","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/103078\/54\/1030785433_0:0:3000:1984_1440x900_80_0_1_7540279bf916d057c62d7780d1874d48.jpg?source-sid=afp","subtitle":"Since the beginning of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, the naval forces of Ukraine have laid about 420 mines on the approaches to the ports of Odessa, Ochakov, Chernomorsk, and Yuzhny, according to Russia's Federal Security Service.","content":"\"The Ukrainian Navy laid minefields on the approaches to the ports of Odessa, Ochakov, Chernomorsk and Yuzhny (about 420 mines of obsolete types of NM (anchor mine) and YRM (anchor river mine) produced in the first half of the 20th century)\", the security service elaborated.

the World Championships taking place in Montpellier from March 21 to 27. \u00a0For Sotnikova, who won gold for Russia in the women\u2019s figure skating singles in Sochi, that makes the event a much

now, for example, it will be boring for me to watch it, because our athletes have set such a high bar.\u201d\u00a0Russian women in particular have dominated the World Championships in recent years, winning five of the last six titles on offer.At last year\u2019s event in Stockholm, Shcherbakova topped the podium ahead of compatriots Elizaveta Tuktamysheva and Trusova.\u00a0After being banned from this year\u2019s showpiece in France, Shcherbakova and world record points holder Valieva will instead be among the stars to contest the Channel One Cup being held in the Russian city of Saransk

According to the tabloid, the soldier had been \u201cbored\u201d with the ceremonial role of his regiment and wanted to see some real action as his promised tour to Afghanistan hadn\u2019t happened, apparently due to the hasty withdrawal of the Western coalition forces from that country last year.The soldier opted to return to Britain after his superiors and fellow British fighters managed to persuade him that the longer he stays AWOL the worse the potential repercussions would get for him, the newspaper reported. Three other active-duty soldiers of the Guard are reported to have gone alongside him to Ukraine are still believed to remain in the country.\u201cThe Guardsman seems to have seen the error of his ways while he was in Ukraine and everyone is hugely relieved about that,\u201d the source told The Sun.\u201cHe was in touch with his chain of command, who told him that he had to return. He knew he would be in trouble but was also told in no uncertain terms that it would be worse the longer he stayed out there,\u201d the source added.The Guardsman is believed to have been detained by military police for questioning immediately after he touched down on British soil. He now could face a jail term for desertion. Earlier this month, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence explicitly warned active-duty soldiers against going to fight in Ukraine on their own.\u201cAll Service Personnel are prohibited from travelling to Ukraine until further notice.

Moscow said on Sunday that it had conducted another such strike against foreign fighters, targeting a special-forces training center near Zhytomyr. Some 100 servicemen, Ukrainians and \u201cforeign mercenaries\u201d alike were killed in the fresh strike, according to Russian military.Moscow attacked its neighbor last month, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

Referring to Moscow's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, the French president also said that he sees his task as \"achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of [Russian] troops [from Ukraine] by diplomatic means\". He spoke after Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters last week that Biden's statements are already becoming personal insults aimed at Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last Wednesday, when asked whether he would call Putin a \"war criminal\" Biden first responded in the negative, but after a pause changed his mind. In another development last week, POTUS did not think twice before calling the Russian president a \"murderous dictator\" and \"a pure thug\". Peskov described the remarks as unacceptable and unforgivable for the president of a country that had killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world with its bombs. According to him, the Kremlin puts Biden's words about Putin down to the irritability and forgetfulness of the US president due to exhaustion. \"Given such irritability of Mr Biden, his fatigue, sometimes forgetfulness, which leads to aggressive statements, we will not give sharp assessments so as not to cause more aggression\", Peskov said when asked whether the Kremlin regarded it as a prerequisite for breaking off diplomatic relations with the United States. The Russian president ordered the start of a special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February following a request from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) to protect them from intensifying attacks by Ukrainian forces. Putin stated that Russia was left with no other choice but to intervene to help the newly-recognised Donbass republics.

The US dollar has served as the global benchmark for international oil sales since the 1970s, when the United States struck a deal with Saudi Arabia to standardise oil prices in dollar terms, an arrangement which led to the creation of the so-called \"petrodollar\". Per Quartz, 80% of global oil transactions are currently denominated in US dollars. Now, it seems the American push to eliminate Russian supplies from global oil markets may have finally been a bridge too far for a number of influential nations in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Regional powerhouses like India, South Africa, and Mexico have all issued public statements declining to take the West's side regarding Moscow' special military operation in Ukraine, indicating a growing willingness among rising Global South nations to finally take the plunge and look past the US monopoly on global trade relations. On Thursday, South African President Cryil Ramaphosa openly declared his support for the Russian Federation's denazification and demilitarisation efforts, noting that the current situation \"could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region\". But that could just be the tip of the iceberg. Arguably more distressing for Western governments are the potential economic ramifications of pushing traditional non-NATO allies away. \"Russian oil exports to India have quadrupled this month\", the Financial Times wrote Friday. The fact that the world's third-greatest oil producer and third-greatest oil consumer are pursuing their own trade relations, outside of the realm of potential Western interference, is \"a sign of the vast reshaping of global energy flows\" they say has taken place since the beginning of the Russian special operation in Ukraine. And it's now looking increasingly likely that Russia and India will go beyond a mere expansion in volume of oil sales, and move towards dropping the dollar together. For much of the so-called \"Third World\", official statements indicate the value of pursuing their own strategic interests now outweighs the risks of potentially jeopardising relations with the West. In such countries, where the ongoing de-dollarisation process inspires more relief than hysteria, long-standing anti-colonial grievances are reemerging. Still, there's little evidence that Washington's war hawks have gotten the memo. Sasse told Fox that \"we need to demonstrate\" that \"freedom-loving peoples around the world would rather have US leadership than Chinese oppression\".  So far, at least, it's unclear how his professed desire to \"cut the Russians off from the global economy\" might benefit the rest of the globe. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

In 78 days, NATO jets conducted 2,300 sorties, dropping 420,000 missiles and bombs, including cluster munitions and depleted uranium rounds. Up to 5,700 people were killed, with tens of thousands more diagnosed with cancers in the years that followed.","content":"Before entering the Oval Office as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president and then as president himself, Joe Biden served as a United States senator for over 30 years. Ahead of, during and after the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Biden was consistently one of the top hawks in Washington pushing for the conflict to be expanded into a full-on ground invasion. \u201cLook, you have probably the only three people in Washington here who think we should go straight to Belgrade and arrest [Yugoslav president Slobodan] Milosevich,\u201d Biden said in a May 1999 appearance on Meet the Press alongside the now late Republican senator John McCain. \u201cBut let\u2019s not kid each other. We\u2019re the only three people. The rest of this is malarkey. The Republican Congress won\u2019t even vote for the bombing. The NATO forces won\u2019t even go along with the idea of ground troops. And whether or not the president will or will not is not relevant. The question to me is: What is the definition of victory?\u201d Biden complained.  In a second video, dated 1998, before the NATO air campaign began, Biden sparred with Republican lawmaker Joe DioGuardi about the Kosovo crisis, boasting that he had called for Belgrade to be bombed and for US pilots to destroy all bridges on the Drina River during the NATO intervention in Bosnia in 1995, which killed over 150 Bosnian Serbs, destroyed critical civilian infrastructure, and irradiated the region with DU munitions. In a third video, from an April 2002 gala dinner of the Albanian American Civic League in New York City, an apparently inebriated Biden vowed to continue to support having US troops \u201con the ground with loaded rifles and drawn bayonets\u201d in the Balkans until US objectives were accomplished. \u201cWhy some of you ask have I been so relentless on Serbia and [post-Milosevich President Vojislav] Kostunica who I do not trust? Why have I been so reluctant, so persistent in not providing aid to the people of Serbia who are many good people \u2013 why? Because until they look in their hearts they can never cure themselves of the disease that they are the oppressed. And as long as they operate on that standard, this cycle will continue and continue and continue. So that\u2019s why, not for vengeance, but for release - that it\u2019s necessary for them to look the devil in the eye,\u201d Biden said. Grim Anniversary NATO began a campaign of air and cruise missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 23 March 1999. The operation, cynically dubbed \u2018Operation Noble Anvil\u2019, continued until 10 June 1999, with a total of about 22,000 metric tonnes of bombs dropped on the country. The use of cluster bombs (37,000 of them) and depleted uranium constituted a violation of the laws of war, and Serbian doctors have reported a dramatic spike in oncological diseases, including juvenile cancers, in the wake of the conflict. In 2017, Serbian scientist Ljubisa Rakic calculated that the amount of DU dropped on Yugoslavia was equivalent to about 170 Hiroshima bombs. The bombing is estimated to have caused up to $100 billion in economic losses, destroying or damaging some 25,000 residential buildings, 470 km of roads, 595 km of railway infrastructure, 14 airports, 19 hospitals, 20 health centers, 69 schools, 18 kindergartens, 176 cultural monuments and 38 bridges. This included a raid on Radio Television of Serbia, which claimed 16 lives, and the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, during which three Chinese nationals were killed. All told, Serbian officials estimate that over a third of NATO\u2019s targets were civilian. NATO\u2019s formal justification for the attacks was a desire to \u201cprotect\u201d Kosovar Albanians from ethnic cleansing and a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe.\u201d Before the conflict began, Albanian separatists allied to radical Islamist forces clashed with Serbian army and police forces in Kosovo and attempted to drive ethnic Serbs out of the region. After the bombing campaign was completed and NATO troops entered the breakaway region, separatists continued their campaign of violence against Serbs, with NATO breaking its promise to disarm the Kosovar militants \u2013 who have subsequently been accused of a series of grim war crimes ranging from killings of civilians to organ harvesting. In 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia, forcing over 200,000 ethnic Serbs to leave their homes. Washington established Camp Bondsteel \u2013 the second-largest American military base in Europe, and has kept \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in the region ever since.

When it comes to Moscow and Kiev, this balance is yet to be determined.As of now, the hostilities continue and no political settlement has been worked out, so it\u2019s hard to say whether the parties can achieve their political objectives, for which a huge price has already been paid in human lives and economic damage of colossal proportions. The prospects for other global and regional players \u2013 the EU, the US, China, Japan and Iran, among others \u2013 are much clearer.The European Union is sustaining damage and losses due to numerous severed trade and economic ties with Russia. The key challenge is to find alternatives to Russian oil, gas, metals, and other commodities on the European market. This will require a great concentration of resources and political will. It will affect the growth of the EU economy and determine how competitive its industry will be in the coming years.Nevertheless, however painful it may be, Russian raw materials can be replaced. For oil, it won\u2019t take long, while Russian gas is a bit harder to cut. The situation will be different from nation to nation within the bloc, as their levels of dependency on Russian resources vary. Still, a range of Russian goods can likely be replaced within a few years.Regardless of the developments on the Ukrainian front and Russia\u2019s foreign policy, pushing Moscow out of the common\u00a0market will be a long-term process.The EU has to take care of Ukrainian refugees. This is not an easy task. The situation is changing rapidly, making an accurate assessment impossible, but we are clearly talking about millions of people. The EU nations need to accept these refugees and help them to adapt and even integrate. Many European countries will have to spend more on social programs. At the same time, this will benefit the EU in the medium term. It has extensive experience dealing with migrants. Germany especially excels at this. Unlike migrants from Islamic countries, Ukrainians aren\u2019t that different from EU Europeans in terms of culture. They are better educated, adapt and integrate faster, and don\u2019t tend to form closed communities. For the economy, this will be a great demographic injection.Most EU countries will vigorously increase defense spending. This will not necessarily correspond to growth in the bloc's political clout, however. It will still remain a junior partner within NATO. However, the political and military role of certain member states will become much more significant. Germany comes to mind again, since it has great capacity to increase its defense spending, modernize its army, and develop its defense industry. For the advanced military-industrial complexes of European countries, this will yield long-term benefits.It will also be a win for the European project as a whole. Russia has become a major consolidating factor for the EU, improving its internal discipline, strengthening its self-identity, and solidifying its Eastern flank.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the surface, America\u2019s expenses are not as significant, although banning Russian oil may cause some difficulties domestically, in the form of soaring gas prices, for example. However, Washington\u2019s main problems are found elsewhere. The sharp escalation in the confrontation with Russia is a distraction from the Asia-Pacific region. The US will have to build up its military presence in Europe, which leaves fewer capabilities for containing China.America is also concerned about the possibility of the Ukrainian crisis turning into a war between NATO and Russia. If taken to the extreme, this could lead to nuclear escalation. Washington will have to contain Moscow but act within certain boundaries in order to avoid escalation here and now. It would appear that the current priority is to manage the intensity of the conflict and make sure it doesn\u2019t boil over.In other aspects, the US is definitely set to make gains.The new level of confrontation with Moscow is helping NATO strengthen internal discipline and encourage European members\u00a0to contribute more to common security.Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush were not able to achieve this. Now it\u2019s being done with no difficulty at all. As a matter of fact, NATO may expand even further. Membership for neutral Sweden and Finland is now up for discussion, and support for this idea is growing in both countries. If Helsinki joins NATO, the bloc\u2019s power will be projected over Russia\u2019s northwestern areas.In theory, the United States could also use the need to divert resources to Europe to its advantage. Washington and its allies are now free to arrange an unprecedented hit on Russia\u2019s economic and technological potential. Russia will undoubtedly remain a major military challenge for America and the West. However, they will be able to undermine the economy that this military potential is based on, and then redirect their attention to Asia.\u00a0The US energy sector has a lot to gain from the crisis. Before long, it will take over a sizable chunk of the European market. It will also now be easier for the Americans to squeeze Russia out of the world\u2019s arms markets. While China and India will remain major consumers of Russian weaponry, Moscow will find it more difficult to compete in other markets due to strong pressure from the US.Over the years, the US has accumulated a host of domestic issues. The \u2018Russia factor\u2019 could help both Congress and American society to regain a sense of unity and cohesion, however short-lived. That said, the degree to which the ongoing crisis could affect the 2024 presidential election remains unclear.Meanwhile, China gains a lot of room for action. Unlike the EU and the US, the PRC stands to lose very little due to the current crisis. Washington\u2019s military and political pressure on Beijing is waning. With an extensive package of anti-Russian sanctions now in place, China can lay claim to a significant share of the Russian market, which has now been vacated by the collective West. While there may be infrastructural and logistical hurdles to overcome, Russian energy resources will become more accessible to China at lower prices than before. Furthermore, China is set to become Russia\u2019s key financial partner \u2013 a partnership that will be skewed heavily in China\u2019s favor. Thus, Beijing is further strengthening its positions on its northern and northeastern borders.There seem to be no alternatives to Russia partnering up with China.China will soon enjoy new opportunities to exert influence in Central Asia. As it learns from Russia\u2019s experience with sanctions, Beijing will tighten its own economic and financial security to withstand a similar confrontation with the West. That said, current developments are unlikely to result in a full-fledged Russian-Chinese military and political alliance. It appears that China will maintain its distance and try to remain as flexible as possible.For Japan, in the short term, losses will most likely outweigh benefits. The prospect of signing a long overdue peace treaty with Russia is becoming very dim. Even before this new phase of confrontation, it was clear that Russia and Japan had reached an impasse in negotiations. While there wasn\u2019t even a hint of progress on that track, at least the theoretical possibility of it remained. After the events of 2014, Tokyo pursued a balanced and pragmatic foreign policy, imposing mostly symbolic sanctions on Russia, while remaining active in the Russian market and maintaining constructive relations with Russia\u2019s leadership. After February 24, 2022, Japan abandoned this approach and chose to stand with the US and the EU.Tokyo will sustain some costs as a result of withdrawing from the Russian market and having to find substitutes for Russian commodities, but these will not be critical. The main consequence is that the escalation of relations with Russia, just as we saw with Germany, will provide a strong incentive for a definitive review of the post-WWII national security paradigm when it comes to the use of armed force. Japan will now have the confidence to begin reclaiming its status as a full-fledged political and military power in the region. As a result, the solution to the \u2018Northern Territories\u2019 issue will be viewed, more and more often, from a military perspective.India will be barely affected. New Delhi will maintain dialogue with Moscow and thwart anyone\u2019s attempts to hinder military and technical cooperation between the two countries. Still, lobbyists for Western arms manufacturers might find themselves in a more favorable position. China\u2019s growing strength resulting from the crisis is a problem for India, but it\u2019s nothing new.The Ukrainian crisis might also benefit a number of countries that are currently suffering from punitive US sanctions. First and foremost, this concerns Venezuela and Iran. Washington might lift some penalties\u00a0to compensate for losses arising from the ban on Russian oil imports. Politically speaking, this is easier to do in Venezuela\u2019s case, since the issue there is ultimately about the governmental system \u2013 something the US could turn a blind eye to for a time. Venezuela\u2019s heavy oil could replace Russian imports on the US market, while Nicolas Maduro\u2019s regime would be able to breathe a little easier and secure some profits in foreign currency.It\u2019s trickier with Iran because of the country\u2019s military nuclear program and the new version of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The latter is a multilateral process that also involves Russia. Technically, the US could let Iran resume trading oil on the global market without a nuclear deal in place. For example, the Biden administration could bring back the waivers that Donald Trump scrapped, which had allowed a number of European and Asian countries to import crude oil from Iran. The problem for the US here is that Tehran would also get a reprieve and strengthen its negotiating position, which would lead to pressure from Republicans who are against deals with the country. In light of pushing back against Russia, however, these differences might end up on the backburner. In any case, Iran would get the chance to benefit from this. This would also prevent the sanctioned countries from forming a coalition that could theoretically include China, Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. China will trade with the other three, but not at the expense of its ties with the West.All in all, the new stage of the Ukrainian crisis will have repercussions on a global scale. For some countries, it will entail losses in the short and medium term \u2013 and significant losses at that \u2013 but for many others, it will open new opportunities for extending their influence in the long-term.This article was first published in Russian on kommersant.ru"},{"uuid":"b7c4360e-b983-4ec8-9327-0d83806dfcac","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552299-latvia-nazi-march-ukraine\/","title":"March in honor of Nazi veterans returns to EU capital","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6235df8120302769437c6c16.jpg","subtitle":"The event commemorating Latvians who fought in the Waffen SS during WWII was suspended for the past two years due to Covid-19","content":"Hundreds of people marched in the Latvian capital Riga on Wednesday to honor their compatriots who fought alongside the Nazis during World War II.Around 200 demonstrators carried the national flags of Latvia and Ukraine, as well as flowers that were laid at the foot of the Freedom Monument in the city center.The event, which was accompanied by a large police presence, was \u201cpeaceful,\u201d according to the local media.There were some counter protesters, but they didn\u2019t interfere and instead silently observed the procession.Among them was a woman who became famous on social media in recent days for carrying a bag with a huge letter \u201cZ,\u201d a symbol of the ongoing Russian military operation in Ukraine.This time, she had her jacket decorated with a Russian tricolor and made a victory sign with her fingers. The woman was eventually approached by officers and driven away in a service car, with police saying it was the only arrest at the event.On March 16, the Latvian Anti-Nazi Committee usually holds counter-events as well. Law enforcement authorities believe the potential meeting of people who hold opposing views creates a risk of provocation and tension. This year, Riga City Council did not approve the application of the Latvian Anti-Nazi Committee to hold a demonstration. Taking into account the situation in the world, in order not to aggravate conflicts, the organization decided against appealing the decision of the city council, said Andrey Pagor, a representative of the committee. Instead of holding a full-scale demonstration, committee members laid flowers at the monument to the victims of the Nazis.The controversial march honoring Latvian members of Waffen SS units had been suspended for the last two years as public gatherings were banned in the Baltic state as part of anti-coronavirus measures.The Latvian authorities had urged the organizers to refrain from staging it this year too. The chairman of the parliament\u2019s National Security Committee Maris Kucinskis argued that the march should be called off to avoid provocations amid the tensions caused by the conflict in Ukraine.Remembrance Day of the Latvian Legionnaires is the day when the soldiers of the Latvian legion, which was a part of Waffen SS, are commemorated. It has been held in the EU country annually since the 1990s, facing condemnation from Moscow, but being largely overlooked by Brussels.Latvian authorities argue that while the legion did, in fact, technically fight on Hitler\u2019s side, most of its members understood their role as fighting to regain independence for Latvia. Being part of the German military forces was the only way of preventing the return of Soviet occupation, Latvia says."},{"uuid":"bafe3cc2-5032-4678-ad14-0bdb9fa4d36a","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/shows\/news\/552822-rtnews-march-29-17msk\/","title":"RT News - March 29 2022 (17:00 MSK)","image":null,"subtitle":"nan","content":"Moscow agrees to drastically reduce its military activity near Kiev, for the sake of successful peace talks, following the latest round of negotiations with Ukraine.

The campaign titled \"Mehngai-Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan\" (Inflation-Free India Campaign) will kickstart on 31 March and will last until 7 April. Protesters, party politicians, and volunteers are expected to take to the streets across India and beat drums and bells to draw the government's attention to the issue. \"On 31st March at 11 a.m., people will protest outside their (BJP politicians') homes and public places with garlanded cooking gas cylinders and beat of drum-bells, other instruments to draw the attention of the deaf BJP government against the insurmountable increase in prices of gas, petrol, and diesel\", Congress General Secretary and Chief Ppokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.

Randeep hit out at the PM Narendra Modi-led government and said, \"The people of India have been betrayed, duped, and deceived by the Modi government\", \"Every day, increases in the prices of petrol and diesel as the also cumbersome increase in prices of LPG, PNG and CNG, has proved the dictum for the Modi government, which is to fleece the people, fill the coffers\", Surjewala said. Between 2 and 4 April, protesters will hold marches and sit-in demonstrations outside BJP politicians' offices at every district level and will culminate with similar protests in state capitals.

Meanwhile, federal Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and federal Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari linked the surge in prices to the Russian special operation in Ukraine to demilitarise and de-Nazify the country, which Moscow started on 24 February. The launch of operation followed appeals for help made by authorities of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics that had been under shelling by Ukrainian forces. Sitharaman on Friday said: \"Fuel prices are surging because of supply chain disruptions due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Oil marketing companies are procuring crude oil on a 15-day average rate, which is higher because of the Russia-Ukraine war. The impact of that is on all the countries\".

According to him, the Ukrainian authorities ordered the nationalist battalions to use all available means to leave the city in disguise and dressed in civilian clothes, including via humanitarian corridors. He went on to reveal that more than 60,000 Mariupol residents have been rescued and, after getting to Russia, these people \"openly talk about all the mass atrocities and crimes perpetrated by the nationalists\". Earlier, on Sunday, the top military official said that Russia was urging Kiev to cancel its orders to the nationalists fighting in Mariupol to sacrifice themselves and become \"martyrs\". According to Mizintsev, the nationalists were given the green light to use more than 200,000 of the city\u2019s residents as \"human shields\". Mizintsev noted that the Russian troops are aware of the \"human shield\" tactics and are acting carefully, avoiding the use of heavy artillery and clearing the city block by block. The Kremlin called on international organisations to put pressure on Kiev to demand that the nationalists do not hide behind people as human shields and release them through organised humanitarian corridors. Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine with the goal to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" the neighbouring country. Moscow underlined that its troops are targeting military infrastructure only and do not pose a threat to civilians. According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the goal is to protect the people of Donbass, \"who have been subjected to abuse, genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years\".

Lawyer Oleg Bydanov, who presented two weekly Russian language programmes on Melbourne's 3ZZZ station as an unpaid volunteer, was accused of airing \"offensive\" content. 3ZZZ manager Jon King claimed some listeners had complained that Bydanov was broadcasting \"offensive material, in conflict with our codes of practise.\" The \"offensive\" content included an excerpt of Russian President Vladimir Putin's speech announcing Moscow's recognition of the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (the DPR and LPR). Bydanov also pointed out that the Russian forces in Ukraine were not targeting civilians, major cities or non-military infrastructure. In another programme, the presenter played a a satirical song that ridiculed the 2014 Maidan Square coup against elected president Viktor Yanukovych. And he informed listeners that he once worked for Alexander Bastrykin, chairman of the Investigative Committee of Russia and former prosecutor general. Bastrykin is one of numerous Russian officials and private citizens now subject to Western sanctions. Bydanov also opined that Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky was more intelligent than many Western politician, including Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. King said that because the station's presenters were all volunteers, \"we don't get to do as thorough a vetting process as a recruitment for a salaried position as, say, SBS would do with their broadcasters.\" 3ZZZ president George Salloum said in a statement that the station condemned \"all acts of war and violence.\" \"3ZZZ promotes harmony and diversity and contributes to an inclusive, cohesive and culturally-diverse Australian community, the first guiding principle under our community radio broadcasting codes of practice,\" Salloum said. Russian TV news channel RT has already been taken off air by Australian satellite operator Foxtel.

The company had initially suspended operations at its Moscow plant at the start of the conflict, but had resumed production since.Another French company named by Zelensky, home improvement chain Adeo, said it would not close its operations in Russia because that would be considered a premeditated bankruptcy and could open its assets up to expropriation, which would only strengthen the government in Moscow.

It is the culmination of a\u00a012-year process by which Canada has sought to replace its outdated CF-18 jets.In its successful 2015 bid to oust Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper from power, the Liberal party of current PM Justin Trudeau campaigned against a controversial 2010 deal to acquire F-35s, vowing to instead pursue \u201copen and transparent competition\u201d as Canada updates its air force.\u201cThey clung to an aircraft that does not work and is far from working,\u201d Trudeau reiterated in 2016, bashing the Conservatives for their plan to procure F-35s.\u00a0His government\u00a0nevertheless eventually chose Lockheed Martin as the preferred bidder, with\u00a0Procurement Minister Filomena Tassi claiming on Monday\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re in a different place today.\u201dWhile Washington and US-based arms dealer Lockheed Martin have touted the F-35 as one of the most advanced fighter jets ever developed, the project has been a costly one for US taxpayers, who've footed the bill for a long series of delays, malfunctions and cost overruns.

On Sunday, doctor Gennadiy Druzhenko told the Ukraina 24 TV channel he had ordered his volunteer unit to castrate all male Russian prisoners of war, \u201cbecause they are cockroaches and not people.\u201dDruzhenko apologized on Monday, saying he had got carried away by emotion and that neither he nor his colleagues have ever maimed anyone or had any plan to do so.Earlier this month, Ukraina 24 presenter Fahruddin Sharafmal repeatedly cited a Nazi war criminal to urge his countrymen to \u201ckill at least one Moskal\u201d \u2013 a derogatory term for Russians \u2013 each and exterminate Russian children so the Russian nation itself would perish.Sharafmal later apologized that his calls for genocide had damaged the reputation of Ukraine, saying he had become emotional because a friend of his had died during the offensive. Ukrainians would \u201cnever be inhuman, unlike the Russians,\u201d he said in his apology video.Arestovich, a psychologist and public relations expert, has been giving daily briefings on the conflict with Russia.

Joe Biden's odds of winning a potential re-election bid are waning: the president's approval rating plummeted to 40% this week, according to a Reuters-Ipsos poll. At the same time, the survey indicated that 54% of Americans disapprove of the president's work amid skyrocketing inflation and US-Russia tensions over Moscow's special operation to de-militarise and de-Nazify Ukraine. To complicate matters further, scandals surrounding his son, Hunter, are continuing to hunt Joe Biden. Thus, the New York Times suddenly acknowledged last week that a trove of bombshell documents discovered on Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop almost a year and a half ago were \"authentic.\" The story was first broken by the New York Post in October 2020. Following the release of the NYT's article former Attorney General Bill Barr on 21 March told Fox News that Joe Biden \"lied to the American people\" during a presidential debate when he called The Post\u2019s exposure of Hunter's emails \"a Russian plant.\" On top of this, Jack Maxey, a political activist and former Steve Bannon podcast co-host, who provided several mainstream media with copies of a hard drive from Hunter's laptop, vowed earlier this week to make the content of the device public. After that Maxey was banned by Twitter. However, on 24 March, in an interview with American journalist Chase Geiser, Maxey said that he is in Switzerland releasing an indexed version of the laptop. However, Hunter Biden's scandals are not limited to the infamous laptop. On 20 March, Dmitry Rogozin, former deputy chairman of the government of the Russian Federation and incumbent director general of Russian space agency Roscosmos, suggested on Twitter that Joe Biden has resorted to the arming of Ukraine in order to \"burn down all possible evidence of his family's corruption\" in the Eastern European state. Following the 2014 coup in Ukraine, Hunter Biden had served on the board of directors of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma despite having no experience in the energy business. Rogozin also tweeted that Russian law enforcement authorities \"might be interested in thoroughly investigating\" the Biden family's alleged misdeeds in Ukraine to understand the American elite's motives and reasons behind the US-backed coup d'etat in Kiev in February 2014. Meanwhile, on 24 March, Chief of Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defence Troops Major General Igor Kirillov told journalists that Hunter Biden's Rosemont Seneca investment fund participated in the financing of the Pentagon's military biological programme in Ukraine. Kirillov noted, citing a trove of documents obtained by the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD), that Rosemont Seneca maintained \"close ties\" with the US defence contractors, including Metabiota and Black &amp; Veatch (B&amp;V), which reportedly supplied equipment for Pentagon bio-labs across the world. Following Kirillov's briefing, Sergei Tsekov, Russian senator and former head of the Supreme Council of Crimea, called for a parliamentary investigation into Hunter Biden's apparent participation in the Pentagon's military biological programme in Ukraine. Washington continues to deny that it has ever been involved in the development of bioweapons in Ukraine. However, Victoria Nuland, US under secretary of state for political affairs, admitted under oath that there are some \"biological research facilities\" in Ukraine apparently overseen by the US. While Team Clinton may indeed capitalise on scandals haunting the Biden family, Hillary and Bill have as many skeletons in their closet as the Bidens, Ortel notes. The Clintons' major problem is their charities which have never been properly organised and managed, according to the Wall Street analyst, who suspect that the Clinton Foundation is mired in a huge charity fraud. Ortel has been investigating the foundation for several years and believes that it was used as a \"vehicle\" for enrichment and pay-to-play schemes by the Clintons. The Clinton family has recently announced the revival of its Global Initiative, which is seen by some observers as yet another signal that Bill and Hillary are returning to big politics. Still, the Clinton Global Initiative appears not to be operating lawfully, according to Ortel. Ortel notes that after holding meetings that arguably served as business development and political advancement forums from 2005 through 2008 in New York and then in Hong Kong during the Obama-Bush transition, the parent and a new \"Clinton Global Initiative, Inc.\" tried but failed to reorganise and to operate lawfully from September 2009 through 2013. \"So, whatever 'CGI' the Clintons believe they might launch again is radioactive, unless NY and federal authorities remain in the tank protecting the Clintons at all costs,\" the Wall Street analyst warns. There is yet another problem on the Clintons' horizon, namely Special Counsel John Durham \"spygate\" investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe. Two indictments released by the special counsel late last year indicate that the Hillary Clinton campaign played a significant role in peddling uncorroborated information about Trump's alleged ties with Russia's Alfa Bank and the Kremlin.  Both claims turned out to be bogus. What's more, at least one participant of the anti-Trump fishing expedition, named Tech Executive-1 in Durham's court filings, bragged that he was offered a position in the Hillary Clinton administration should she won. Even though Hillary Clinton continues to portray the Durham investigation as a right-wing conspiracy, the American public is unlikely to \"fall for yet another Clinton family ruse,\" concludes Charles Ortel.

As Putin\u2019s deal would involve interacting with Russia\u2019s central bank, European leaders have been reluctant to agree.\u00a0However, Habeck said that Germany is prepared for Russia to potentially cut off the flow of gas should a deal not be reached. The Kremlin has threatened to shut off the gas flow to countries who refuse to pay in rubles, and Russian newspaper Kommersant reported on Thursday that energy giant Gazprom is currently \u201cconsidering the possibility of a complete halt in gas supplies \u2026 and is assessing the consequences of such a step.\u201dGermany is heavily dependent on Russian energy, with Russia providing more than half of its gas supply, and a third of its imported oil. France counts on Russia to provide around a third of its gas and around 10% of its oil.

The incident occurred in the middle of service and was captured on video by stunned churchgoers. The footage quickly made its way across social media, with many reporting it as Ukrainian nationalists assaulting and kidnapping a pro-Russian priest.\u00a0In the video, alleged members of Ukraine\u2019s Territorial Defense Forces can be seen assaulting and forcefully dragging away the priest, as well as another man who was reportedly trying to aid him in the confrontation.The incident occurred at the Church of the Intercession, which is part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is still loyal to the Moscow Patriarchy.\u00a0It comes amid an ongoing rift between Ukrainian churches. Since the early 1990s, some clerics have been breaking away from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) and joining the independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine under the Kiev Patriarchy (OCU), rejecting historic ties with Russia.\u00a0In recent years, the rift has been characterized by forceful takeovers of some temples in Ukraine by Kiev-allied worshipers and activists, which the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) has decried as \u201cwild.\u201dLast week, Ukrainian lawmakers introduced a bill to parliament calling for the complete ban of the Moscow Patriarchy on the territory of Ukraine and the seizure of all its assets within the country.A representative of UOC-MP, Archpriest Vasyl Vozniuk, who is the secretary of the Cherkasy Diocese, issued a statement regarding the kidnapping, saying the provocation was carried out at the behest of a group of local priests, led by Father Nikolai Seredich, who has been inciting \u201cschismatic actions\u201d by demanding the temple break away from its Russian counterpart and join the OCU.\u00a0\u201cIn recent weeks, several priests from Smila, without consulting or informing their colleagues \u2013 most of the clergy of the Smila denomination and their own parishioners, began to incite each other and readers from the internet to schismatic actions,\u201d he said.Vozniuk claims that the church tasked Father Vasyl Miroshnychenko with quelling the discord in the Smilan church, however, the insurrectionists apparently accused him of harboring pro-Russian sentiments and invited a group of armed men to forcefully remove Father Vasyl. Some of these \u201cpeople with weapons\u201d are reportedly still \u201con duty\u201d near the temple.The statement from the secretary goes on to claim that Father Vasyl is currently \u201calive and well\u201d and \u201ccontinues the service and confession of the clergy of the Smilansky denomination,\u201d while Seredich, who has been accused of inciting armed people to use violence against the priest, has been banned from the priesthood pending an investigation into this incident.Nevertheless, the video of the incident has quickly gone viral, and many have been expressing outrage over the actions of the Ukrainian territorial defense forces members. The head of Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee, Aleksandr Bastrykin, has issued an investigation into the matter, which has been declared a kidnapping, with the goal of \u201cidentifying the persons involved.\u201dThe incident comes as Moscow is currently carrying out a military operation in Ukraine. However, the village of Smila has not seen any combat during this period, although some parts of the Cherkasy region have experienced shelling from both Russian and Ukrainian forces.Russia\u2019s operation was launched last month, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French- brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military alliance. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the Donbass by force."},{"uuid":"c121b66b-ec65-41ca-a8cc-62eb0afa7c70","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552301-lavrov-russia-west-normalization-relations\/","title":"Russia comments on normalization of ties with West","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6235e4ed2030277aa37c7a9e.jpg","subtitle":"Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow will wait and \u201csee how they will find a way out of the dead end\u201d they created","content":"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has made it clear that Moscow will not propose initiatives to normalize relations with the West at this point.On Saturday, Lavrov announced that while Russia was \u201copen to cooperation with any countries, including Western ones,\u201d Moscow was not going to \u201cpropose any initiatives\u201d aimed at normalizing relations with the West.

Lavrov said that in private conversation, many European colleagues had told him that they realized that sanctions were a road to nowhere. Yet those European officials supposedly also told their Russian counterpart that there was such a thing as the European consensus. Lavrov claimed that no one in Europe apparently had the guts to make their true feelings regarding anti-Russian sanctions known.Following February 24, when Russia launched a military campaign against Ukraine, the US, Canada, the whole of the EU, Australia, Japan and several other nations slapped crippling sanctions on Moscow, targeting, among other things, the country\u2019s central bank\u2019s assets, a number of major commercial banks, as well as Russia\u2019s top officials, including Putin and Lavrov."},{"uuid":"c2866e8f-e946-439d-b89a-8bbe60e65b26","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552430-white-house-explains-why-biden\/","title":"White House explains why Biden won't visit Ukraine","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6238ec3a2030276c621f9fb1.jpg","subtitle":"The president will soon embark on a European trip which will include Warsaw","content":"The White House has effectively ruled out the prospect of US President Joe Biden visiting Ukraine, making it clear that the option has not even been considered.\u00a0Press Secretary\u00a0Jen Psaki was speaking to journalists, on Monday, ahead of the American leader's scheduled trip to Europe.\u00a0\u201cWe have not explored this option,\u201d Psaki said when asked\u00a0during Monday\u2019s press briefing if a trip to the war-torn country was on the cards.

Chelsea have lobbied for terms of the special licence to be amended and have received some dispensations from the UK government, but restrictions on travel budgets remain in place. The club are also not allowed to sell tickets or merchandise, a move which forced the closure of Chelsea's club store.Several of the bids are understood to be under serious consideration. The Ricketts Family's experience in guiding the Cubs to the\u00a02016 World Series crown is thought to have demonstrated a measure of expertise in how a sports franchise can be successfully operated, while\u00a0Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly is also thought to be at the top of the queue.British property investor Nick Candy has also pledged to \"give football back to the fans\" should his bid prove to be successful, and has also confirmed that he will oversee a much-needed redevelopment of the club's Stamford Bridge stadium.\u00a0Candy has also stated he will give a \u2018golden share\u2019 stake to fans, meaning that supporter groups will have a say in Chelsea's future plans.\u00a0\"Chelsea is one of the most iconic and successful professional football clubs in the world, with a rich heritage, global following, and a highly valuable brand,\" Candy said.\u00a0\"Football clubs are vitally important community and cultural assets, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to give football back to the fans and put them at the heart of the operations and strategy of a leading global football club.\"I believe Chelsea has all of the fundamentals to become the most valuable and respected sports club in the world and a force for the greater good in everything it does.\"It is also understood that there were more than 20 parties interested in bidding, with around 10-15 official bids submitted.Chelsea and the Raine Group will whittle the contenders down to a shortlist next week, with the successful bidder then requiring approval from the government as well as being required to show the source of their funds.The successful bidder will also be required to pass the Premier League's\u00a0owners' and directors' test.It is thought that Abramovich values Chelsea at around \u00a33 billion. He has also loaned the club \u00a31.5 billion - a sum which he says he is happy to write off.\u00a0Chelsea, though, will be hoping that any proposed deal will progress without any further snags as the sanctions against Abramovich have left them mired in financial turmoil, and as they struggle to contend with a \u00a328 million per month wage bill."},{"uuid":"c2bfe9aa-ef1b-4f51-928f-50b1de88092e","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/business\/552320-australia-ban-exports-aluminum-russia\/","title":"Australia bans exports of aluminum ore to Russia","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6236eabf85f54032d66898b8.jpg","subtitle":"Canberra claims its exports account for 20% of Russia\u2019s alumina needs","content":"Australian authorities have prohibited all exports of alumina and bauxite to Russia in a bid to limit Moscow\u2019s capacity to produce aluminum, according to a joint statement from several ministries, including the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201cRussia relies on Australia for nearly 20% of its alumina needs,\u201d the statement read.\u201cThe government will work closely with exporters and peak bodies that will be affected by the ban to find new and expand existing markets.\u201dAnglo-Australian mining major Rio Tinto holds an 80% stake in Queensland Alumina in a joint venture with Russia\u2019s Rusal International, which is currently ranked as the world\u2019s number one aluminum producer.Earlier this month, Canberra introduced sanctions against two Russian businessmen linked to the mining industry, including tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who holds a stake in Queensland Alumina.The latest penalties come as part of broader international sanctions imposed on Russia by Western allies over the military operation in Ukraine launched by Moscow on February 24.So far, the Australian government has introduced a total of 476 sanctions on 443 individuals, including businessmen close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

He is an acclaimed figure at home and has received numerous awards for his work from the Defense Ministry and the National Security Council.A darling of the Western media amid the Russian attack on his country, Druzenko is fluent in English and has been readily speaking to the likes of CNN and the New York Post about the work of what these outlets have dubbed the \u201cmedical angels.\u201dAs Ukrainian civilians join the fight, well-known intellectual Gennadiy Druzenko has fired up an ambulance corps.Our conversation, from today\u2019s GPS: pic.twitter.com\/lQh98Xo2BRBefore the conflict, Druzenko undertook several stints at various Western institutions, serving as regional director for a USAID-funded project in Ukraine in the early 2010s, according to his CV. He also worked as a researcher at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, in the US, from 2009 to 2010, and at the Max Planck Institute, in Germany, in 2010.During his interview with Ukrainian TV, Druzenko acknowledged that his unit had a \u201cmilitary wing\u201d composed of ex-commandos, and that his team had been jokingly calling themselves the \u201cFirst Volunteer Mobile Storm Unit\u201d because of it.\u201cWe treat ours and turn theirs into fertilizer.

However, prices refuse to come down for those in California.","content":"On Tuesday, the average cost of gas per gallon reached $6.01 in Los Angeles, the highest number in the nation. Surrounding counties in the Golden State include costs of $5.97 in Orange County, $5.95 in Ventura County, and $5.90 in Bernardino County. The average for the rest of the state comes to $5.86 per gallon. Industry watchers suggest that the drastic spike is due to flaring at PBF Energy refineries located in Torrance, Martinez, and Valero outside of San Francisco. Flaring is a safety device used by refineries to prevent \u201coverpressure\u201d of equipment. Planned flaring is scheduled, but unplanned flaring is used for emergencies caused by equipment failure or other unexpected events. According to Patrick De Haan, head analyst at GasBuddy, the California refineries could be experiencing computer or valve issues which have caused them to use flaring as a safety solution, but that is reportedly just a guess, as refineries do not willingly release that kind of information. Even if refineries in California get their safety issues under control, De Haan says it\u2019s not certain that will bring the costs of gas down, considering other global issues such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic. California is also known to have higher gas costs on average, considering their strict environmental laws and taxes on motor fuels as a means of curbing CO2 emissions and protecting the environment as humanity continues to avoid addressing its climate crisis. A decrease in California\u2019s gas supply would likely affect other states on the West Coast, such as Oregon and Washington, as the two Pacific Northwest states may soon see the same price gouging by the fossil fuel industry in Los Angeles. An increasing number of Californians may be turning away from gasoline as an option. \u201cDemand destruction\u201d is when prices are so high that consumers choose to do away with their purchase of that product. \"Above $4 per gallon, you do see the American public change their driving habits. And we do actively see demand destruction,\" says Regina Mayor, global head of energy at KPMG. Californians have been turning toward electric vehicles to avoid price spikes at the pump. And while some EVs are more expensive, such as Teslas or BMWs, other brands, including Volkswagen, are more affordable due to monthly rebates that the state offers consumers, like the California Clean Fuel Reward, as well as federal rebates. Michael Macias, who became California\u2019s millionth EV owner in December 2021,  said the cost of gas played a major role in his decision to purchase an EV. Macias used $9,500 in state rebates, $750 from the California Clean Fuel Reward, $7,500 in federal rebates, and, because he is a resident of San Joaquin Valley in Central California, he gets $3,000 rebates from the Air Pollution Control District to purchase his electric Volkswagen. Macias says that after he factored in the cost of gas compared to the monthly car payments for his new EV, for him, the choice was clear. \u201cSo those are the two things that I was thinking about, along with the fact that I am committed to being a good steward of the land,\u201d Macias said. \u201cThis is part of me living into those principles and values.\u201d Let's stay in touch no matter what!

The ambassador also said Russia is asking Ukraine not to attack any critical infrastructure objects or place any heavy military equipment in residential and densely-populated areas to ensure the protection of humanitarian and medical personnel, the wounded and the ill, and of civilians, as well as ensure the humane treatment of detainees. In addition, Nebenzia said that Moscow calls on all parties not to politicize the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. On Wednesday, the UN Security Council rejected a humanitarian resolution from Russia that called for a negotiated ceasefire in Ukraine. Only Russia and China voted in favor of the resolution, while 13 members of the UN Security Council, including the US, the UK and France - abstained from voting on Russia's draft resolution, and no countries voted against. The resolution condemned all of the violations of international humanitarian law and human rights, including the Geneva Conventions. It also demanded respect and protection for the medical and humanitarian personnel on both sides of the ongoing conflict who are exclusively engaged in medical and related duties in Ukraine. Chinese envoy Zhang Jun stated after the vote that the failure of the UNSC vote for a Russian-drafted resolution regarding the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine is regrettable. The UN Security Council has recently held a series of discussions about the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine to demilitarize and de-Nazify the country after the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics requested military assistance to defend themselves from the intensifying attacks from Ukrainian troops in the regions.

However, he told Belarusian TV he soon came under surveillance there and opted to move on.The former handbag manufacturer was detained by border guards upon trying to cross into Belarus in August, and subsequently requested asylum.

The initiative is meant to deprive Moscow of the opportunity to mitigate the effects of Western sanctions on its economy by monetizing other assets, in an effort to punish the Kremlin for its military action in Ukraine.\u201cRussia\u2019s massive gold supply is one of the few remaining assets that Putin can use to keep his country\u2019s economy from falling even further. By sanctioning these reserves, we will further isolate Russia from the world\u2019s economy and increase the difficulty of Putin\u2019s increasingly-costly military campaign,\u201d King explained.The American politicians behind the initiative believe that Moscow is using gold to hinder the devaluation of its national currency, the ruble. Washington is concerned that vast gold reserves allow the Kremlin to purchase other currencies on the international market.\u201cSecretary Yellen regularly meets with members of Congress to discuss legislation. Additionally, Treasury staff frequently provide technical assistance on sanctions bills,\u201d\u00a0a Treasury Department spokesperson said.On March 8, the same group of US senators introduced a bill designed to close this loophole in the sanctions that allows Russians to trade gold.

The ambassador promised that \"serial sanctions strikes\" will ultimately fail at achieving their goal. Antonov called on America to solve its own problems, and not to assert themselves at the expense of Russia. A number of countries around the world have introduced new sanctions against Russia due to the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. According to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, Western sanctions are very serious, but Moscow knew they were coming and prepared in advance. He added that retaliatory measures are being developed in close coordination between various government departments to meet the national interests.   Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the policy of containment and weakening of his administration is a long-term strategy of the West, and sanctions have dealt a serious blow to the global economy.

In the early hours of February 24, Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine after the Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for help in defending themselves against the Kiev forces. Russia said that the aim of its special operation is to demilitarize and \"denazify\" Ukraine and that only military infrastructure is being targeted.

Oil prices had already risen sharply in anticipation of the operation, the disruption it would cause to Russian gas exports, and the retaliation threatened by the West if the operation went ahead. The US has already released a considerable amount of oil from its reserve in recent months in response to rising gasoline prices, which have helped push inflation to its highest level in 40 years.

In a column for Saturday's Daily Mail, Brown claimed \"Such a tribunal would show we are serious and close off a loophole in international law that Putin could use to dodge justice\" \u2014 although he did not explain how it could arrest the sitting head of state of a country which did not recognise its jurisdiction. A recent online petition demanded the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecute the Putin \"regime\" for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, \"as well as Russia\u2019s oligarchs and his enablers\". But, like the US and Israel, Russia is not a party to the Rome statutes that recognise the authority of the ICC, a court that has famously only ever prosecuted African leaders. Over the past two weeks, the Ukrainian government has accused the Russian Air Force of bombing a maternity hospital and theatre in Mariupol, a city in Donetsk oblast occupied by the neo-Nazi Azov battalion of the Ukrainian territorial army, killing and injuring civilians.  The Russian Ministry of Defence has insisted it carried out no strikes on the city on the days in question and accused Ukraine of staging \"false flag\" bombings as a provocation. It pointed to media reports from February that Azov militants had evicted patients and staff from the hospital and turned it into a military strongpoint. Brown drew a direct parallel with the Nuremberg tribunals, where Soviet military prosecutors led the charge against Hermann Goering and other surviving Nazi leaders. \"From Britain \u2014 which rightly prides itself on democracy and the rule of law \u2014 the message must go out. At Nuremberg we held the Nazi war criminals to account\", Brown wrote, skipping over Russia's role in de-Nazifying Europe. \"Eight decades on, we must ensure there will be a day of reckoning for Putin\". Before becoming PM in 2007, Brown served as chancellor and effective number two to his predecessor Tony Blair from 1997 onwards. He budgeted funds for Britain's participation in three unprovoked military offensives: the 1999 bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, and the invasions and occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq. Major was prime minister during Britain's participation the 1991 Gulf War. During that conflict, a US-led coalition air raid targeted the Amiriyah civilian bomb shelter in Baghdad, killing 1,500 civilians, mostly women and children. The coalition forces also left Iraq strewn with toxic depleted uranium munitions. Neither former PM has ever been charged with or even investigated for war crimes.

His most recent book is Decolonising the University: The Challenge of Deep Cognitive Justice and he is the recipient of the 2022 Frantz Fanon Lifetime Achievement Award to discuss Europe\u2019s complicity in the crisis in Ukraine by ignoring the longstanding problem of NATO aggression against Russia and the weaponization of Ukraine, the prioritization of financial interests by European governments over their people in failing to take any action to prevent conflict on the continent, the United States use of Europe as a junior partner and its historic domination over European affairs, and how the US rivalry with China factors into the US domination of Europe. In the second segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Brian Mier, co-editor of Brasil Wire and author of Year of Lead: Washington, Wall Street and the New Imperialism in Brazil to discuss the history of Nazi ideology in Brazil and the effort to \u201cUkrianize\u201d Brazil by increasing the influence of neo-Nazis in the country, the communication and assistance that Ukrainian neo-Nazis provide to Brazilian neo-Nazis and Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s connections to the ideology, and what this \u201cUkrainization\u201d effort might mean in Brazil\u2019s upcoming presidential elections.

The crash itself, from what we know so far, also seems weird. We only have initial reports, but the local emergency management department said it lost contact with the plane at 2:15. Five minutes later, the plane went into a deep dive at its cruising speed, AP says, \u201cThe data suggests the plane crashed within a minute and a half of whatever went wrong.\u201d Next, Nicolas Davies, independent journalist, a researcher with CODEPINK, and the author of Blood on Our Hands: The American Invasion and Destruction of Iraq joins the show to talk about how Saturday marked the 19th anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq, a war that technically ended in 2017, but in reality is still ongoing. More than one million Iraqis were killed and there was barely a mention of it in the US media. Also, over the weekend, Yemen\u2019s Houthis launched missile attacks on Saudi oil installations in Yanbu and elsewhere, damaging facilities, but causing no injuries. And, the US announced that it would send Patriot surface-to-air missiles to Saudi Arabia to protect it against future Houthi attacks. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad made a surprise trip to the United Arab Emirates. It was his first visit there since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2009 and Assad\u2019s third trip abroad in that period. He met with the Crown Prince and leader of Dubai. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky remotely addressed the Israeli Knesset to ask for Israeli assistance and for the Israelis to impose sanctions on Russia. He received a polite response but no promises. Later in the show, Kimberly Dvorak, investigative journalist and political analyst covering foreign policy joins the show to talk about the split in the Republican Party between anti-war conservatives and neoconservatives. Senator Liz Cheney was on one of the Sunday morning talk shows calling for a No-Fly Zone. The Misfits talk about whether the rift is going to be a political problem for the Republicans campaigning in the 2022 midterms. Then, Daniel McDaniels, Executive Director of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity.

The parties are accused of having links to Russia, though the new leader of the largest party, Opposition Party for Life, earlier this month called for an immediate ceasefire and for Russian troops to leave the country. For the last segment, Kim Keenan, adjunct Professor at George Washington University and Former General Counsel of the NAACP joins the show to talk about an interesting opinion piece in the Washington Post last week which presented two important cases before the Supreme Court that could affect the power and impunity of law enforcement. As it summed up, In one case the court will consider whether federal law enforcement agents who clearly, knowingly and willingly violate someone\u2019s constitutional rights can even be held financially liable. In the other, it will decide whether two doctors should be held criminally culpable and imprisoned for 20 or more years based on law enforcement officials\u2019 opinions about proper medical treatment \u2014 even if the doctors believed they were acting in their patients\u2019 best interests. So we have a case about how law enforcement can be punished for brutality and how law enforcement should be involved in the opioid crisis.

A leading factor behind this is the one-sided coverage of the crisis by the country's main news outlets. ","content":"Israel hasn't taken an official anti-Russian stance since Moscow began a special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February. Although it has so far absorbed thousands of Ukrainian refugees, set up a makeshift hospital in western Ukraine, and provided its people with humanitarian assistance, Israel has refrained from joining Western sanctions. Tel Aviv's also not agreed to provide Kiev with military equipment. But that isn't the case with Israel's media. Local newspapers and channels have bashed the Russian operation, presenting it as President Vladimir Putin's desire to resurrect the past glory of the Soviet Union. The press has portrayed the Ukrainian government as victims and its armed forces as a strong army, fighting for its survival. Russia's position is never heard. This biased coverage of the conflict has done the trick. According to a poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute, 67 percent of Israelis felt Russia was responsible for the situation in Ukraine. But Guy Even-Tzur was not one of them. Even-Tzur, who has been following the situation for years, says he is well aware of the atrocities the Ukrainian Army perpetrated against its own people in Donbass, a region in the east of the country, bordering Russia. He is also aware of the Ukrainian government's ambition to join NATO, an organisation that has been challenging Russia for years, and says he understands the logic behind Putin's actions. His sympathy, however, doesn't lie with the Ukrainians for yet another reason - the Holocaust. On the eve of World War II there were 2.7 million Jews in the Soviet Republic of Ukraine. Between June 1941 to May 1945, some 1.5 million were murdered. Many at the hands of Nazi collaborators, including Ukrainians. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who spoke to Israeli parliamentarians a week ago, was trying to tell a different story. He claimed his people were helping Jews during the Holocaust, and he has called on the Israeli government to follow suit and extend a helping hand to Ukrainians, who are fighting \"Russian aggressors\". His comments were slammed by many Israeli politicians and individuals, and Even-Tzur says he shares their criticism. But what he also says is that Israel should not be going the extra mile to help Kiev, especially because it might jeopardise the Jewish state's relations with Moscow. Aside from enjoying stable cultural and economic ties, Israel and Russia have also been cooperating on a number of security projects. Moscow has played a pivotal role in the mediation between officials in Jerusalem and those in the Gaza Strip, and it has also coordinated actions on the Syrian front to avoid potential collisions over Syrian skies.

They also asked city officials to assess the value of the material the monument is made from, and see if it can be used \u201cfor the benefit of the victims of the Russian attack on Ukraine.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unsettling that, in the heart of Berlin, we\u2019re honoring a person who was antidemocratic,\u201d David Paul, a spokesman for the local CDU branch, said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about the fact that now we have a war in Europe led by a man who uses democracy as a fig leaf,\u201d he added, apparently referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Paul said the monument was \u201cnot entirely worthless,\u201d because, according to him, the sale of bronze could bring between \u20ac1.5-2 million ($1.6-2.1 million).A former leader of the German Communist Party, Thalmann was imprisoned in the Buchenwald concentration camp and executed by the Nazis in 1944, reportedly on Adolf Hitler\u2019s personal order. The monument by Soviet sculptor Lev Kerbel was unveiled in 1986. The bronze sculpture stands on a massive pedestal made of marble that was mined in Ukraine.The idea to do away with the monument received a mixed response. Hannah Wettig from the Green Party backed the move, arguing that a site dedicated to Thalmann would only make sense \u201cas a part of a memorial that clearly names the crimes of Stalinism.\u201dBerlin Deputy Mayor and Senator for Culture Klaus Lederer, who is a member of the Die Linke (The Left) party, however, told Berliner Morgenpost that \u201cthere are better ways of helping Ukraine, without the destruction of cultural property.\u201d He added that Soviet-era monuments remain under state protection.Felix Reifschneider of the liberal Free Democratic Party accused Paul of \u201cpopulism,\u201d while his colleague, Thomas Enge, said that the questions surrounding the monument should not be mixed with the \u201csuffering in Ukraine.\u201dThe memorial has long been an issue of debate.

After detailing such perils as civilian casualties and struggles to evacuate the wounded, he noted that German soldiers killed during World War II are buried in the city.\u201cOur city is being wiped off the face of the earth,\u201d Atroshenko told reporters. \u201cOnly the Nazis did this. In Chernihiv there is a cemetery of Germans who died here during the Second World War. We support it.\u201d I want the Germans to hear this. Russia, which you continue to support, is bombing the graves of your grandfathers.By support, Atroshenko meant that Germany is continuing to buy Russian oil, natural gas and coal, even as NATO members try to isolate Moscow and crush its economy through sanctions. Chernihiv, located northeast of Kiev, has been one of the cities hit hardest by the Russian military offensive. Less than half of its population of about 290,000 remains in the city.Ukrainian leaders have pointed to various motivations in their campaign for international support, accusing Russia of attacks on civilians and painting Kiev as a defender of freedom. The Nazi graves are apparently a new and ironic wrinkle in those efforts.President Vladimir Putin ordered the offensive last month, saying Russia would \u201cdemilitarize\u201d and \u201cdenazify\u201d the Kiev government. US President Joe Biden took issue with that claim in a speech on Saturday in Warsaw, saying it was \u201cobscene\u201d to speak about \u201cdenazifying\u201d Ukraine because President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish.However, Kiev has embraced a number of World War II Nazi collaborators, such as Stepan Bandera. The Azov Battalion, a neo-Nazi militia, was used to quell dissent following the US-backed overthrow of Ukraine\u2019s elected leadership in 2014. Far-right nationalists helped lead the coup and took positions of power, such as deputy prime minister, in the new government.As for civilian casualties, Russian officials have said Moscow is using precision weapons and hitting only military targets. Mayor Atroshenko acknowledged that most of those wounded in Chernihiv are military casualties.More than 1,100 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since the offensive began, according to a United Nations estimate. Upward of 3.7 million people have fled the country."},{"uuid":"c87d006b-553e-424a-a1b3-2148c292400d","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/553003-lavrov-ukraine-talks-progress\/","title":"Progress made in Ukraine talks \u2013 Moscow","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/62448b4285f5402b763c7856.jpg","subtitle":"The Russian foreign minister points out areas of progress in Istanbul talks with Kiev","content":"Talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in Turkey have produced one significant step forward: Kiev giving up on Crimea and the Donbass, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed on Wednesday, during a visit to China.\u00a0Lavrov was attending a conference on Afghanistan, hosted by his Chinese colleague Wang Yi.

A number of the antique, Soviet-made mines had already detached from their cables, the FSB claimed, warning that the munitions could drift across the Black Sea into the Bosphorus Strait and ultimately into the Mediterranean.The allegations were disputed by the Ukrainian side, however, which insisted that the mine scare was nothing but Russian disinformation being used as excuse to close off parts of the sea.

These are just some of the recommendations made by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in a 10-point action plan aimed at cutting oil consumption \u201cin the face of the emerging global energy crisis triggered by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u201dAccording to IEA estimates, the actions it suggests, should they be implemented, could help reduce oil consumption by 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd) within four months, which would be equivalent to more than half of Russia\u2019s exports. It is estimated that the world consumes nearly 100 million bpd.Among the measures to be enacted immediately, especially by developed nations, are the reduction of speed limits on highways by at least 10km\/ph (6mph), and so-called car-free Sundays, with every such day helping to save approximately 380,000 barrels of oil, according to the energy watchdog.The document goes on to point out that car-free Sundays are nothing new, in fact, as similar measures were introduced in countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands, and West Germany at the height of the 1973 oil crisis. Moreover, certain cities have adopted the practice more recently to improve public health, the IEA notes. In addition to the drop in oil consumption per se, car-free Sundays\u2019 positive side effects would include cleaner air, reduced noise pollution, and improved road safety, it adds.In addition, the IEA recommends that those who can work from home up to three days a week do so. Among the other initiatives it advises governments to consider are cheaper public transport and incentives to buy bicycles.In its plan, the IEA points out that besides reducing the \u201cprice pain being felt by consumers around the world,\u201d the suggested measures could also help \u201cshrink Russia\u2019s hydrocarbon revenues, and help move oil demand towards a more sustainable pathway.\u201d The paper concludes that the reduction of oil consumption is more than just a short-lived push, and, instead, is crucial for tackling climate change.Following February 24, when Russian troops crossed the Ukrainian border, oil prices have shot up to almost $140 per barrel \u2013 levels not seen since 2008."},{"uuid":"c6bd159b-0f31-42b2-a61d-2d05c5c37bb4","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552650-nato-bombing-serbia-remains-unrecognized\/","title":"NATO\u2019s bombing of Serbia: A tragedy in three acts","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623cb43985f5404ff777a0c5.jpg","subtitle":"It is a travesty of international justice that the events of 1999 remain unrecognized by the perpetrators and have gone unpunished","content":"Twenty-three years ago, NATO bombed Serbia. This act was the opening round of what was to become a 78-day illegal war of aggression, the repercussions of which haunt the world to this day.Act One: The EncounterIt was a chance meeting \u2013 two men who had crossed paths in Iraq two years past, now running into each other on a stretch of highway connecting Kosovo to Macedonia. The date was March 20, 1999. Monitors assigned to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) were in the process of being withdrawn from their assigned areas of responsibility to the town of Ohrid, in Macedonia, due to the collapse of diplomatic talks with Serbia about the devolving situation in the Serbian autonomous province of Kosovo, where Albanian separatists were engaged in a quasi-civil war with the Serbian authorities.The British contingent of the KVM was stopped at the border between Kosovo and Macedonia, awaiting final clearance to cross the border. Among the British observers was a former Royal Marine officer who had previously served with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in Iraq, helping oversee the dismantling of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programs. While he and his fellow observers waited, he watched as other vehicles driven by members of the US observer contingent drove in the opposite direction \u2013 into Kosovo. At the wheel of one of these vehicles was a familiar face \u2013 a man who was known as \u2018Kurtz\u2019.Kurtz was a man of tremendous experience who was brought into UNSCOM in mid-1997 for the purpose of providing operational planning and leadership. \u2018Kurtz\u2019, of course, was not his real name, but rather a nickname derived from the fact that with his shaved head, walrus mustache, and weathered face, he looked like a combination of Robert Duvall\u2019s Colonel Kilgore and Marlon Brando\u2019s Colonel Kurtz in the movie \u2018Apocalypse Now\u2019. With a wide-brim Stetson, cowboy boots, and an ever-present wad of chewing tobacco stuck in his cheek, he looked every bit the part.Kurtz was picked for this job in part because of his background, which was embedded in the world of covert special operations. His most recent assignment prior to coming on board at UNSCOM was preparing diplomats for E&E \u2013 escape and evasion \u2013 from hostile situations. Given the sensitivity of some of the UNSCOM operations taking place in Iraq at that time, it was thought that such training might be ideal for situations the inspectors might find themselves in.But Kurtz\u2019s background had been his undoing. He was, so to speak, too \u2018black\u2019, or covert, for his own good. Even though he was performing wonderfully in Iraq, his managers in Washington began to panic when the situation in Baghdad began to deteriorate in October 1997. The decision was made to pull Kurtz out of Iraq. It was bitter irony \u2013 the one man who was best equipped to deal with a hostage situation, to keep not only himself but other, less fully-trained personnel alive and well, was being withdrawn in haste out of fear of his being taken hostage.Once Kurtz was assigned to UNSCOM, he was technically UN property for the duration of the assignment, and the US could not just simply snap its fingers and bring him home. But snap, they did, with the US ambassador, Bill Richardson, summoning the Australian diplomat who headed UNSCOM, Richard Butler, to the US Mission in New York for a meeting. \u201cOne of the personnel provided to you [Kurtz],\u201d Richardson said, \u201cis a bit too exposed by the current situation, and we feel that it would be best for us all if he were withdrawn at this time.\u201dI oversaw the team in Iraq that Kurtz and the British officer were assigned to. Butler called me up to his office after his meeting with Richardson. \u201cThe man\u2019s CIA,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe Americans want him out.\u201dNow, as the Kosovo Monitoring Mission was departing Kosovo, Kurtz was back in action. The Americans, it seemed, wanted this man with the impressive covert operations skill set back in.The role played by the CIA in the OSCE KVM is quite controversial \u2013 at a time when the US and NATO were accusing the Serbian government of committing atrocities, the CIA was using the cover provided by the OSCE observer mission to coordinate with fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army who were engaged in a guerilla war with the Serbian military. Serbian operations in response to CIA-directed KLA attacks were being characterized by the West as \u2018genocide\u2019, and used to justify a planned NATO aerial bombardment of Serbia.These facts, however, ran counter to the narrative of a Serbian-initiated campaign of ethnic cleansing which the US and NATO were spinning. The British OSCE observers were well aware of the complex reality of what was transpiring inside Kosovo, where legitimate Serbian military operations against known KLA forces were being described as \u201cmassacres of innocent civilians\u201d by the Western media. The truth, however, was often inconvenient, which is why at that moment in time, on March 20, 1999, the British observer contingent found itself exiting Kosovo at the same time Kurtz and his fellow CIA officers were going in.Act Two: The Phone CallMarch 24, 1999. 9:20am. In the White House Situation Room, an aid places a phone call to the Kremlin, where Russian President Boris Yeltsin is waiting. The call goes through, and the aid hands the phone to Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the United States. The conversation started off with a grim notification: The leaders of NATO, including himself, Clinton said, \u201chave decided we have to launch air strikes against military targets in Serbia soon.\u201dThe problem, Clinton noted, was the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic. \u201cHe has displaced 30,000 more people just since last Friday,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe is killing innocent people. We have reports of summary executions.\u201d Left unspoken was the role played by Kurtz and his fellow CIA operatives in creating the conditions for such actions. Clinton continued. \u201cHe [Milosevic] has basically told Russian, EU, and American negotiators that he doesn\u2019t care what any of us think.\u201dClinton was getting worked up by the consequences he had triggered by unleashing the CIA on Kosovo. \u201cMy God, they [the Europeans] have nightmares they\u2019ll [the Serbs] repeat Bosnia and all the instability and all the problems, and it will spread from Kosovo to Macedonia to Albania and engulf all of their southern flank. They are very, very worried about it. They are right to be worried about it.\u201dAgain, left unsaid was the fact that the very scenario that was giving the Europeans nightmares had been carefully crafted by the CIA, at Bill Clinton\u2019s direction.Yeltsin wasn\u2019t buying any of it. \u201cIt is easy to throw bombs about,\u201d he said, dismissing Clinton\u2019s characterization of the problem and proffered solution. \u201cIt is intolerable because of the hundreds of thousands of people who will suffer and die.\u201dThe consequences of any NATO strike, Yeltsin warned Clinton, were dire. \u201cIn the name of our future, in the name of you and me, in the name of the future of our countries, in the name of security in Europe, I ask you to renounce that strike, and I suggest that we should meet somewhere and develop a tactical line of fighting against Milosevic, against him personally. And we are wiser, we are more experienced, and we can come up with a solution. That should be done for the sake of our relationship. That should be done for the sake of peace in Europe.\u201dThe Russian leader\u2019s pleas fell on deaf ears. \u201cWell, Boris,\u201d Clinton replied, \u201cI want to work with you to try and bring an end to this, but I don\u2019t believe there is any way to call off the first round of strikes because Milosevic continues to displace thousands of people every day\u2026 I don\u2019t want this to be a great source of a split between Russia and Europe and Russia and the US. We have worked too hard. There are too many economic and political things for us to do together, and I regret this more than I can say.\u201dThe American president was outright lying to his Russian counterpart \u2013 the events in Kosovo were unfolding along the lines of a carefully scripted game plan that had been in motion for some time. War was inevitable because the US, through the CIA, had shaped the narrative to make it so. Worse, the US president was willing to sacrifice relations between the US and Russia in pursuit of this NATO objective. This fact was driven home by Yeltsin in his closing remarks.\u201c[O]ur people,\u201d Yeltsin lamented, \u201cwill certainly from now on have a bad attitude with regard to America and NATO. I remember how difficult it was for me to try and turn heads of our people, the heads of politicians towards the West, towards the United States, but I succeeded in doing that, and now to lose all that. Well, since I failed to convince the President, that means there is in store for us a very difficult, difficult road of contacts, if they prove to be possible. Goodbye.\u201dAct Three: The BombOn the evening of March 24, 1999, the secretary general of NATO, Javier Solana, a Spanish diplomat, authorized aircraft operating under the auspices of NATO to begin bombing targets in Serbia. It was no coincidence that the first aircraft to drop bombs on Serbia were F\/A-18s belonging to the Spanish Air Force.When examining the legitimacy of the use of force by Spain against Serbia in March 1999, several facts stick out. First is that Spain, as a member of the United Nations, is bound by its commitment to the Charter of that organization. When it comes to the use of force, the UN Charter is quite clear \u2013 there are only two acceptable conditions under which such force might be legitimately employed by a member state. One is an enforcement action to maintain international peace and security, carried under the authority of a resolution passed by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter. The other is the inherent right of individual and collective self-defense, as enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter.As Spanish bombs fell on Serbian soil, two things were quite clear \u2013 there was no Chapter VII resolution in existence which authorized an enforcement action against Serbia, and Serbia had committed no act of aggression against either Spain or its NATO allies that would justify any claim of self-defense in explaining the Spanish (and NATO) military assault on Serbia.In short, by dropping bombs on Serbia, the Spanish Air Force was initiating an illegal war of aggression. \u201cTo initiate a war of aggression,\u201d the judges who comprised the International Military Tribunal convened in Nuremberg to judge the crimes of Nazi Germany, declared, \u201cis not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulative evil of the whole.\u201dSpain wasn\u2019t alone that night \u2013 aircraft from the air forces of the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and other NATO members participated in this \u201csupreme international crime.\u201d Viewed individually, there is no doubt that each nation involved in the attack on Serbia violated the UN Charter and, as such, is guilty of the crime of initiating an illegal war of aggression.Not so fast! NATO, it seems, had crafted a novel legal argument built around the notion that it had a right to anticipatory collective self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and that this right was properly exercised under \u201cnormative expectation that permits anticipatory collective self-defense actions by regional security or self-defense organizations where the organization is not entirely dominated by a single member.\u201d NATO, ignoring the obvious reality that it is, indeed, dominated by the United States, postulates that it is, indeed, such an organization, comprised as it is of \u201ca number of powerful states, three of which are permanent members of the Security Council.\u201dThe credibility of the NATO claim of \u201canticipatory collective self-defense,\u201d however, arises from its characterization of the Kosovo crisis as a humanitarian disaster infused with elements of genocide which created not only a moral justification for intervention, but a moral necessity.Tell that to Kurtz, the man who, together with his fellow CIA operatives acting under the authority given them by the president of the United States, Bill Clinton, worked to create conditions on the ground inside Kosovo that could then be used to manufacture the very narrative of a humanitarian crisis sufficient in scope and scale to allow NATO to craft its novel legal justification for attacking Serbia.The problem for NATO is that its legal justification was built on a foundation of lies. The fiction that NATO is an organization not entirely dominated by the United States evaporates the moment one understands the role played by the CIA in preparing the script used by NATO to justify its actions. The fact that this script promulgated outright fabrications of alleged crimes perpetrated by Serbia to justify NATO military intervention only underscores the criminal nature of the entire NATO enterprise.There is no escaping the fact that when the first bomb dropped by the Spanish Air Force on Serbia that evening 23 years ago to this date impacted on the ground, Spain and every other member of NATO had committed the \u201cultimate crime.\u201dThat this crime remains unpunished is a travesty of international justice. That this crime remains unrecognized by those who perpetrated it is a testament to the hypocrisy of nations. That this crime set in motion the events that have led to the current state of affairs between the US and NATO on the one hand, and Russia on the other, is a global tragedy."},{"uuid":"c8f1de19-8d35-4d1b-817e-16077eb24b18","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552697-russia-ukraine-white-phosphorus\/","title":"Kremlin responds to claim it used banned munitions in Ukraine","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623dc31285f54007c7109ba7.jpg","subtitle":"Kiev and Moscow have accused each other of deploying deadly white phosphorus on the battlefield","content":"Russia has denied that it used white phosphorus during its military assault on\u00a0Ukraine, responding to accusations by President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The principle of indivisible security has been addressed by Russia since December 2021, when Moscow rolled out its security proposals to the West. Moscow demanded the alliance not expand eastward to include Ukraine and Georgia, to which Washington replied by insisting it will not allow anyone to slam the alliance's open-door policy shut. Responding to this, Russia pointed at the principle of indivisible security, which states that the security of any state cannot undermine the security of another.  In January, the Russian Foreign Ministry sent letters to each EU country, urging to focus on the principle and work out any \"differences in the understanding of the principle of equal and indivisible security\". However, a response was received only from the bloc, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell saying that Brussels would act as one on all issues of key common interest, including coordinated replies to letters. Moscow said it could not accept a \"collective\" response when it sought feedback from each addressee. Lavrov expressed hope that the current \"abnormal\" situation between Russia and Ukraine will be resolved, but warned that the West is going to prevent this from happening.  Elaborating on the influence that Western countries have on Ukraine, Lavrov pointed at the biological weapons' components purportedly being created in the Eastern European country under US supervision. Lavrov estimated that the United States is seeking a unipolar world where every country will obey the strongest one. Such a view envisages no global village, the Russian foreign minister outlined; it would rather be \"an American village\". He said that Washington has managed to \"mobilise\" the world based on American interests - something that, Lavrov believes, points to the actual scale of \"independence\" of the European Union and NATO members. However, not everyone is ready to agree with that, according to Lavrov. Russia, he said, is also \"not in the category of countries who would be ready to do so\". According to Lavrov, the West continues to wage an \"information war\" against Russia,  trying to present one side of the story behind the Ukrainian conflict. He also pointed at how Washington tries to use TikTok to \"brainwash\" children - something that Lavrov said is \"not fair\". The West's intention is to marginalise Russia, the top diplomat said, using its unprecedented pressure to curb Russia's development. Yet, even in the face of the massive waves of sanctions, Russia will work out the measures to respond and keep improving the country.  The Russian foreign minister said that the country has so far faced over 5,000 individual sanctions - a record that eclipses the restrictions imposed against Iran and North Korea.  What is happening now, Lavrov said, cannot be compared to the amount of sanctions introduced against Moscow after the events of 2014, when Crimea was reunified with Russia, but the experience of that time allowed the country to learn a lesson that helped it prepare for the current situation.  His interview comes amid the ongoing Russian military operation in Ukraine, launched on 24 February. The Kremlin said the goal was to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" its neighbour and protect the people from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics suffering at the hands of the Ukrainian military. The military operation has received strong condemnation from the Wests, with nations imposing harsh sanctions targeting Russian businesses, culture, financial sector, media outlets, and many other areas.

In some cases, the campaign has reached bizarre levels, like banning Russian-themed food or classical literature.","content":"President Vladimir Putin has weighed in on the heights that anti-Russian hysteria has reached in some Western nations, suggesting attempts are being made to \u201ccancel\u201d Russia along the lines of campaigns targeting those who do not \u201cfit into\u201d the modern zeitgeist. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to mention the phenomenon of cancel culture, or the public ostracism of, boycott of, or silencing or neglect of facts, books, names, historical and public figures, authors. People who don\u2019t fit in, who can\u2019t be placed in modern templates \u2013 however absurd the latter may be,\u201d Putin said, speaking to laureates of awards in culture and art on Friday. Putin pointed out that the last time such a campaign to destroy \u2018objectionable literature\u2019 was carried out was in Nazi Germany nearly 90 years ago. Cancel culture did not start yesterday, Putin said, but has reached a point where fundamental norms and values and the laws of nature themselves are being undermined and \u201cbroken\u201d in some nations. \u201cIn a number of countries, and particularly in the countries of the so-called West, such phenomena have not only penetrated politics, public life, sports, and education, but are also dominant in other spheres, and are aggressively imposed there,\u201d he said. The Eastern Front tied up to eighty percent of Axis military strength during World War II, with the USSR losing 26 million people, including 8.6 million troops who died in battle, and over 17 million civilians and PoWs, in the struggle against Nazi Germany and its allies. The president also recalled another example, pointing out on the day that the Japanese pay remembrance to the atomic bombings of their country, they are made to remain \u201cshamefacedly silent\u201d about who dropped these weapons, or state simply that \u201csome abstract Allies\u201d were responsible. Textbooks for children \u201csimply don\u2019t say that it was the United States that carried out this terrible and unjustified massacre at the end of World War II,\u201d Putin said. Putin suggested that cancel culture is \u201cimpossible to imagine\u201d in Russia, and that the country is \u201cinsured\u201d against it thanks to its own national culture. \u201cFor us, it is inseparably linked to our homeland, to Russia, where there is no place for ethnic discrimination, where representatives of dozens of nationalities and ethnic groups have lived, worked and raised children together for centuries.\u201d Putin also pointed to the role of Russian cultural figures in shaping world civilization over the centuries, calling their contribution \u201cinvaluable.\u201d \u201cFor centuries, Russian masters of literature, music and fine arts have given humanity not only new aesthetic traditions, but also, very importantly, ideals and meanings that have become moral and spiritual guidelines for millions of people, for entire generations,\u201d he said. Putin expressed hope that the \u201ctruth\u201d about Russia would one day be revealed to the world through culture. \u201cI think many people know about and have seen how a street artist in Naples recently drew a portrait of \u2018canceled\u2019 Russian writer Fedor Dostoyevsky. This gives me hope that through the mutual sympathies of people, through the culture that binds and unites all of us, the truth will breakthrough; that art and education will sow only intelligence, kindness and the eternal, as should be the case,\u201d Putin concluded. The Russian military operation in Ukraine has sparked a dizzying campaign of both centralized and spontaneous efforts to \u2018cancel\u2019 and ban everything Russian abroad, from Russian vodka and dumplings, to performers, musicians, artists and athletes. Even long-dead Russian authors and composers have not been left unscathed.

According to French newspaper Le Monde, Mathieu B had been the subject of a complaint filed in October 2021 by the Jewish Observatory of France (l'Observatoire Juif de France), an association with an online reporting platform exercising discreet surveillance to unearth signs of supremacist militant ideology. Accordingly, the man was monitored as part of an investigation by Paris' Central Office for Combating Crimes Against Humanity, Genocide and War Crimes (l'Office central de lutte contre les crimes contre l'humanite, les genocides et les crimes de guerre (OCLCH)). The French inter-ministerial service gendarmes have a unit dedicated to online hate. According to the report on the internet, Mathieu B called himself \"the great monarch\" or \"Saint-Claude 88\", these last two numbers being a neo-Nazi reference. The number 88 represents the phrase \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d because H is the eighth letter in the alphabet. The man is believed to have been communicating over the internet with like-minded individuals, and challenging opponents of his \u201cvirulent anti-Semitism\u201d and a plethora of far-fetched conspiracy theories he is believed to have embraced. Once the Russian operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine began, Mathieu B opted to flee his adopted country, together with his wife and children. OCLCH gendarmes were notified on 28 February, four days after the start of the Russian operation in Ukraine, that Mathieu B had crossed the Hungarian border in a car, with his family. Assisted by their colleagues from the Marseille surveillance group, the OCLCH officers arrested the 37-year old on 18 March on a public highway in the south of France. After a judicial investigation opened on 20 March, the man was \u201cindicted on the same day for counts of racial insults and incitement to hatred and racist discrimination by electronic means\u201d, then placed under judicial control, said the judicial source who was cited. Although this particular case is not linked to foreign mercenaries, it comes as Russia has repeatedly warned foreign countries against allowing their citizens to travel to Ukraine to take part in hostilities. Moscow stressed that anyone firing at Russian troops during the special operation will be considered a valid target. Russia's President Vladimir Putin authorised the launch of the special military operation in Ukraine after a request from the newly recognised Donetsk and Lugansk People's republics (DPR and LPR). Moscow had been left with no other choice after Kiev failed to implement the Minsk agreements and needed to protect the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbass population in the wake of continued attacks by Ukrainian forces.  Western countries led by the US have condemned the operation, branding it an \"invasion\",  expressing readiness to supply Ukraine with weapons, and targeting Moscow with a sanctions campaign.

Sources said that the rules regarding External Commercial Borrowings have been relaxed for the Russian entities to invest in bonds issued by Indian firms. External Commercial Borrowings have benefited Indian Inc. immensely over the years as it is a cheaper source of financing.  Indian firms have raised $31.18 billion in the financial year 2022 against the backdrop of a stable currency and the availability of more affordable funds in the overseas market during the economic crisis. The earnings on the investments would be transferred to the Russian entities in rubles through a decades-old account which has existed with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  This will also reduce the negative impact of rupee devaluation on the cost of borrowings as a strong dollar makes overseas fundraising costlier. On Thursday, Russia\u2019s Trade Representation in India said that a rupee-ruble channel of payments is already operating. Experts have pointed out that sanctions imposed by the US and its allies in response to Moscow\u2019s special military operation do not prohibit facilitating rupee-ruble transactions. The Biden Administration has warned Chinese entities of possible sanctions if they bypass US sanctions on Russia. However, the US remains cautious in making such remarks against India, even as New Delhi stressed that it would purchase oil and gas and operate a rupee-ruble payment mechanism to continue trade transactions with Russia. On Thursday, Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar said in parliament that \u201cthere is no question of linking the Ukraine situation to issues of trade\u201d.  However, Aditya Pareek also advised India to remain cautious as the Biden administration may continue to impose additional sanctions in the days to come.  \u201cThe implicit threat of secondary US sanctions will remain no matter how craftily India might try to navigate the situation, and this applies to letting Russian entities invest in bonds of Indian companies,\u201d Pareek added. The US announced additional sanctions on more than 400 Russian officials and business people amid ongoing operation by Russian armed forces in Ukraine. The military operation started on 24 February at the request of the people of Donbass, who have been facing Kiev\u2019s aggression for eight years.

By far the largest expense is military and defense spending. President Joe Biden is requesting $813 billion for the Pentagon, including $13.6 billion earmarked to fund Ukraine\u2019s military efforts during Russia\u2019s special operation in the region. Within the discretionary budget, $813 billion will be spent on defense-related programs, compared to $769 billion for domestic spending. Programs like Social Security and Medicare are not considered part of the discretionary budget because they are self funded and cannot be altered through normal budget proposals. Last year, Biden requested $753 billion for defense, only to have Congress increase that number to $782 billion. That is likely to be the case again as more so-called progressive members of Congress have signaled a willingness to support ever growing military budgets in response to the situation in Ukraine. Republicans will likely target $875 billion as the final defense spending budget, according to an analyst quoted in Defense News. Another larger point of contention in the budget is what could be the largest tax increase by dollar amount in the country\u2019s history. If passed, the tax increase would drastically reduce the deficit, but Republican lawmakers are not likely to support the proposal. As is, the budget includes a $2.5 trillion tax increase on large corporations over the next ten years and a 20% minimum tax on unrealized capital gains for households with a net worth of over $100 million. However, conservative-leaning Democrats such as Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema have opposed similar tax increases in the past, and Democrats declined to include a billionaire tax in last year\u2019s budget proposal.  Without any Republican support, passage would require every Democratic senator and the vast majority of Democratic representatives to vote for the plan. President Biden, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have struggled to get their party to move in lockstep on progressive proposals. Tax breaks for oil and energy companies would also expire under the proposal, leading to $43.6 billion in revenue over the next ten years, but that is also unlikely to survive congressional adjustments to the budget. The president and state lawmakers are currently advocating increased oil production domestically to lower costs for consumers after sanctions on Russia increased oil prices worldwide. Another $33.2 billion is set aside for law enforcement, as Biden attempts to distance himself from progressives who want to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d fulfilling his promise from his State of the Union speech on March 1. \u201cWe should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities[.]\u201d For context, $33.2 billion would be equivalent to the 11th largest military budget in the world. The fiscal year 2023 will start in October of this year, giving Congress six months to negotiate the details.

Japan also sent a protest to Russia in connection with the Kremlin's decision, the Secretary General of the Japanese Cabinet of Ministers, said during a press conference. Earlier on Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that in response to what it characterized as unfriendly steps by Tokyo, Moscow would refuse to negotiate a peace treaty with Japan, halt visa-free travel for Japanese citizens to the southern Kuril Islands, and withdraw from dialogue with Japan on establishing joint economic activities in the southern Kurils. Japan claims the islands of Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan, and Habomai in the Kuril Island chain, based on a trade and border contract signed in 1855. Moscow claims indisputable sovereignty over the islands, which were annexed by the USSR following WWII. While post-World War II negotiations never resulted in a peace treaty, Japan and Russia agreed to expedite negotiations in 2018.  However, as Russia initiated its military operation in Ukraine on February 24, Japan joined the Western countries in implementing sanctions against Russia. The Kremlin announced that its special military operation was launched in response to requests for assistance from the republics of Donetsk and Lugansk against attacks by the Ukrainian military.

The UK\u2019s Daily Mail was first to report on his role in bankrolling pathogen research. A memo sent by a Metabiota official to the younger Biden just months after Crimea rejoined Russian in 2014 suggested that the Californian bioweapon research firm could assist Kiev in asserting \"Ukraine\u2019s cultural and economic independence from Russia.\" Hunter then introduced Metabiota to officials at Burisma who expressed interest in what he termed as a \"science project\" involving biolabs. He also reportedly bragged to investors that he helped Metabiota find new customers among government agencies.

Other outlets and media organisations, including the Daily Beast, NPR and Media Matters for America, have continued to dismiss the Russian MoD releases and western outlets' reporting as \"crazy\" \"conspiracy theories,\" notwithstanding Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland's remarks in a Senate hearing earlier this month confirming that \"biological research facilities\" were operating in Ukraine, and that the US was \"quite concerned\" that \"Russian troops...may be seeking to gain control of\" the facilities and the \"research materials\" contained therein. In a presentation on 6 March, the MoD published a letter by Ukrainian Health Minister Viktor Liashko dated 24 February (the same day the Russian military operation in Ukraine began) ordering the destruction of deadly pathogens scattered across Ukraine's network of biolabs.

A recent hiccup in the negotiations regarding Russia\u2019s ability to continue its existing trade relationship with Iran despite the sanctions imposed in the wake of its\u00a0attack on\u00a0Ukraine has been resolved despite western concerns Moscow was deliberately holding up the deal.Borrell\u2019s statement at Doha came shortly after a surprise appearance by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who echoed the US\u2019s oft-repeated plea to oil-producing nations to increase production so that Russia cannot \u201cblackmail\u201d other countries by refusing to sell them fuel. However, thus far it has been Washington that has attempted to bar Moscow from selling its fuel, calling for a total ban of Russian oil and gas sales to the US. The country has continued to sell oil and gas to Europe, however, warning that should the continent attempt to join the US with an embargo of its own, they would only be hurting themselves.Former president Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal shortly after taking office and Washington showed little interest in reviving it until Russia\u2019s recognition of the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk in the Donbas and subsequent offensive against Ukraine triggered the spike in oil and gas prices.While the US attempted to convince major oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia to increase their output to compensate for the cutoff of trade relations with Russia, its pleas have largely fallen on deaf ears, making the White House seek help from countries it once considered enemies, including Venezuela and - potentially - Iran. Saudi oil production and refining facilities have also come under heavy attack in recent weeks from the Houthis, who are still languishing under a blockade by the Saudi-led coalition that prevents critical food and medical supplies from reaching them.The JCPOA nuclear treaty put firm limits on the development of Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for lifting sanctions that have hamstrung the nation\u2019s economy for years. While it was adopted in 2015, the sanctions were never completely rolled back, and bad blood has simmered among multiple parties as each accuses the other of failing to hold up their end of the bargain. The current iteration of the deal has been negotiated over the course of nearly 12 months.\u00a0"},{"uuid":"d0cdd003-4b38-4317-ac05-e23f515dcf64","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220330\/bidens-budget-poisoned-negotiations-prison-services-corruption-1094307654.html","title":"Biden\u2019s Budget, Poisoned Negotiations, Prison Services Corruption","image":null,"subtitle":"Restrictive laws proliferate across US states but talks between Ukraine and Russia show some promise, so it\u2019s not all bad news.","content":"Misfits John Kiriakou and Michelle Witte are joined for a conversation about President Joe Biden\u2019s new budget proposal by Robert Hockett, Edward Cornell Professor of Law and a professor of public policy at Cornell University in New York, senior counsel at Westwood Capital and a Century Foundation fellow.

US officials and media initially denied that the labs existed, but a senior Biden administration official later confirmed their presence.","content":"An investment firm connected to US President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden has been implicated in the financing of the Pentagon's military biological programme in Ukraine, the head of Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defence Troops has announced, citing fresh documents. According to the MoD's information, the fund has at least $2.4 billion in investment capital. \"At the same time, a close relationship has been established between the the fund and key contractors of the US military, including Metabiota, which alongside Black &amp; Veatch is one of the main suppliers of equipment for Pentagon biolaboratories around the world,\" Kirillov added. The Los Alamos National Laboratory - birthplace of the US atomic bomb, has served as one of the chief curators of the US military biological programmes in Ukraine, Kirillov said. \"The scale of the programme is impressive. Along with the Pentagon, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Soros' Open Society Foundations, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are directly involved in its implementation,\" the officer said. \"Scientific supervision is carried out by leading research organizations, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which developed nuclear weapons for the Manhattan Project. All of this activity has been carried out under the direct control of the Pentagon.\" Kirillov accompanied his presentation with new Ukrainian-language documents detailing the operations of laboratories suspected of involvement in US-funded military biological activities, including a detailed listing of 31 laboratories across 14 settlements. The MoD also released a document from the office of the secretary of defense approving Project Concept UP-2, described as a 'multi-pathogen mapping' project which \"includes molecular fingerprinting of pathogens endemic to Ukraine and strain transfer.\"  The 2008 document was signed by Richard Douglas, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense during the George W. Bush administration, and Arthur Hopkins, a deputy assistant to the Secretary of Defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programmes. Kirillov provided other new details on US military biological activities in Ukraine in his presentation, citing documents detailing the testing of unlicensed pharmaceutical products which did not pass licensing procedures in the US and Canada on Ukrainian military personnel under a programme known as 'Deep Drug'. \"Documents confirm an attempt to test previously untested drugs on Ukrainian military personnel [under the] Deep Drug screening system for pharmaceuticals which have not passed the licensing procedure in the United States and Canada. The special cynicism of the US sponsors of the programme lies in the fact that the developer -Skymount Medical Group, offered to purchase the system on a commercial basis, even though employees of the Ukrainian defence ministry were used as volunteers\" for its testing, Kirillov said. Kirillov also that over 4,000 individuals were involved in research under the previously detailed Project UP-8, and that according to a Bulgarian media investigation, 20 Ukrainian servicemen died and 200 hospitalized during experiments in the Kharkov laboratory alone. The officer suggested that such practices were nothing new, recalling that in 2010, authorities in Indonesia terminated biological research activity being conducted by the US Naval Medical Center in Jakarta over numerous violations and a refusal by US authorities to inform the Indonesian government about the results of their research. Kirillov also revealed that Pentagon-affiliated pharmaceutical firm Gilead has been involved in the testing of its products in Ukraine and Georgia. Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defence Troops have established that the US and its allies have exported about 16,000 biosamples from Ukraine as part of their military biological activities in the country. \"Such large-scale screening of the natural immunity of the population was likely carried out in order to select biological agents that are most dangerous for the population of a particular region,\" Kirillov said.  The officer pointed to the taking of blood samples from 4,000 servicemen in Lvov, Kharkov, Odessa and Kiev for antibodies to hantaviruses under Project UP-8, and an additional 400 samples probing for antibodies to the Crimean-Congo fever virus. He added that in addition to tissue and blood serum samples, dangerous pathogens and their carriers were exported abroad from Ukraine. Over 10,000 samples were sent to the Lugar Center in Georgia alone, according to Kirillov, with labs in the UK and the Leffler Institute in Germany also serving as recipients, subjecting not only Ukraine but the entire region to dangers. Kirillov warned that the spread of pathogenic biomaterials in Ukraine could lead to a new pandemic, saying that in the Russian military's view, \"the current situation involving the spread of pathogenic biomaterials from Ukraine to European countries can cause death and create a hotbed of epidemiological instability the scale of which would be comparable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\" The officer pointed to the Pentagon's record of causing health scares involving deadly pathogens, recalling that betwen 2005 and 2015, live anthrax spores were accidentally sent from the US Army Dugway Proving Ground to 194 addressees in ten different countries. Krillov also pointed to suspected US interest in the means of transmitting anthrax through insects. \"The interest of US military biologists in the study of insect vectors in the locations of cattle burial grounds appears not have been accidental, with researchers analyzing the results of an outbreak of anthrax in Yamal in 2016, during which cases of transmission of the disease through flies and horseflies were recorded,\" he said. The officer echoed concerns voiced by China's foreign ministry earlier this month about the real purpose of the 336 labs scattered across 30 countries being operated with US funding and other forms of support, and suggested that in light of the new information which has been disclosed, an international investigation is in order. Thursday's revelations by the MoD follow a separate document dump last week containing frightening details on some of the research feared engaged in at US-funded laboratories scattered across Ukraine, such as work studying the transmission of diseases through bats, 'Project Flu-Fly-Way', studying how wild migratory birds might be used as vectors to transmit avian influenza, and others. The Russian military started disclosing details on the scale and scope of the US-funded network of biolabs in Ukraine on 6 March, reporting, citing documents, that the Ukrainian health ministry had given the order to scrub incriminating evidence on research into deadly pathogens including anthrax, the plague, tularemia, cholera and other deadly diseases. US officials and media dismissed the Russian allegations, releasing \"fact check\" pieces explaining that the \"false claim of US biolabs in Ukraine [is] tied to [a] Russian disinformation campaign.\" These same officials and outlets were forced to change their tune after US undersecretary of state Victoria Nuland confirmed that the biolabs existed, and that the US  was \"quite concerned\" that Russian troops might take control of the facilities.

They\u2019ve taken in a fortune,\u201d he said, referring to what he believes is alleged corrupt activity between the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, and a Ukrainian gas company.The younger Biden had joined the board of Burisma Holdings \u2013 one of Ukraine\u2019s largest private natural gas producers \u2013 in 2014, soon after the Maidan protests in Kiev that ultimately installed a pro-Western government in the country. The violent coup was backed by the administration of former President Barack Obama, in which Biden senior held the position of vice president.During the 2020 election campaign, Trump claimed that Biden had used his influence and his government position to get his son the job, with a reported salary of $83,000 per month, and later pressured then-President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko to fire a prosecutor, who had been investigating alleged violations at Burisma.The elder Biden confirmed that he threatened to withhold a loan to Kiev in order to get a prosecutor sacked, but insisted that this was done to get rid of a corrupt official, in line with bipartisan US policy. His campaign denied all other claims.Trump\u2019s own attempts to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch a new, publicly announced probe into the Biden family\u2019s dealings with Burisma resulted in \u2018abuse of power\u2019 and \u2018obstruction of Congress\u2019 charges against him, which eventually led to an impeachment.\u201cUkraine would've never happened\" if he was still the US president, Trump assured his crowd.He mentioned Biden numerous times during the speech, saying that the Democrat\u2019s stay in the White House has been \u201cone train wreck after another.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe five worst presidents in American history\u201d together \u201cwould not have done the damage Joe Biden has done in just 15 months,\u201d the 75-year-old insisted. \u201cIn just over a year, he has managed to kill, literally kill, the American dream.\u201d\u201cBut do not lose hope, because, with the right leadership, America will be back, greater, stronger, and more powerful than ever before,\u201d Trump promised, stopping short of announcing another run for office in 2024.Unlike Biden, Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin was \u201csmart\u201d for using the military build-up near the Ukrainian border to put pressure on Washington during the negotiations for security guarantees, he said.

While the alliance has declined to defend Ukraine, which is not yet a member, it has vowed to defend the territory of its members, several of which border Ukraine. That total comes as NATO doubled its Enhanced Forward Presence deployment to Eastern Europe last week, sending four new battle groups to Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. The other four battle groups were already deployed in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia; together the eight battalion-sized units consist of roughly 10,000 troops. NATO\u2019s eastward expansion has been a major foreign policy concern of the Russian Federation since the end of the Cold War. The alliance was formed in 1949 by several Western European capitalist states who banded together to jointly resist either a Soviet invasion or a socialist revolution in one of their own countries. Although it claimed to be an alliance in defense of democracies, from the beginning that claim was made farcical by the inclusion of Portugal, which was ruled by the Estado Novo dictatorship of Antonio Salazar. NATO again expanded eastward in the 2000s, when Romania, Bulgaria, several former Yugoslav republics, and the Baltic States joined; the latter were considered particularly provocative, as they had previously been part of the USSR itself. Ukraine and Georgia, two other former Soviet Republics, have also grown increasingly close to NATO and after the 2014 US-backed coup in Kiev, the new Ukrainian government made the goal of joining NATO a priority and even added it to the Ukrainian Constitution in 2019. In recent negotiations to end the Russian operation, Kiev has signaled it is willing to give up its NATO membership ambitions and become a politically neutral state.

Remarkably, she was mirroring the words which had been said by Ukrainian ambassador to Denmark Mykhailo Vydoinyk, who suggested that Ukrainian refugees should not be integrated into Denmark, but return to their home country and help build it up when the time is right. The Danish Foreign Minister, Frederiksen's party mate Mattias Tesfaye said that the government expected that \u201csignificantly more\u201d Ukrainians could arrive than the 20,000 for whom the municipalities had prepared originally. Through the special law, the Ukrainian refugees have been allowed to stay in Denmark for two years, where they'd be granted work permits as well as access to education and health services. The law was adopted urgently and in record time through a cross-party consensus. The Danish approach has sparked criticism from, among others, Human Rights Watch, which accused the Nordic country of double standards in treating refugees from different countries. According to the organisation, in the past years, Denmark has been \u201cat the forefront among European countries to enact pernicious laws and policies designed to deter people from seeking asylum\u201d, to the point of declaring a zero-asylum policy. The organisation also noted the so-called \u201cjewellery law\u201d, which allowed the government to seize asylum seekers\u2019 assets, including their jewellery, to fund their stay in the country. Remarkably, Ukrainians were exempted from this law.

So Russia was provoked to gather troops at the borders.\"What usually happened when Russia tried to negotiate with the West? In 1939, there was a non-aggression pact with Germany. Two years later, Germany attacked, killing 27 million Soviet citizens.\"Then there was the 1990 contract. As a result, NATO included Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania \u2013 the former Soviet republics that border Russia.\"This made it possible to place nuclear warheads and military bases a few kilometers from Russia. Let's remember how, in 1962, the USSR wanted to deploy missiles in Cuba, which was under blockade. This made the USA very worried. The Third World War, a nuclear war, almost started.It surprises me that some people didn't know I'm a Communist.

And it will not end until the US stops the pressure. It would be better if Russia ended the conflict eight years ago, securing the residents of Donbass.\"Minnesota-born Monson said the West had spent eight years ignoring\u00a0Donetsk and Luhansk being bombed by the Ukrainian army.\"They fired on civilians,\" he said. \"But now that Russia has entered into a conflict with Ukraine, everyone is talking about it \u2013 the media, celebrities, American citizens.A post shared by Jeff Monson (@jeff_monson_official)\"[The media in the west] do not provide any alternative point of view.

It is not true that Russia wants to take over Ukraine.\"The US has repeatedly violated resolutions and human rights and carried out war crimes throughout history, according to Monson, who cited his birth country's military and financial interventions in Afghanistan, Israel and Palestine, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen and asked why Russia is portrayed as\u00a0a \"villain\" on the international stage.The 51-year-old\u00a0suggested that media organizations are more likely to support and avoid frankness about their own country but described\u00a0reporting in the west as \"completely false\".\"When I watch RT, I don't feel like I'm being lied to,\" he added. \"With Western media, this feeling never leaves me.A post shared by Jeff Monson (@jeff_monson_official)\"Russia is a great country.

It is run by corporations. He just does what he is told.\"I don't believe in all this pseudo-democracy. It doesn't matter if he's healthy or not. Of course, it's funny when he forgets words and makes mistakes. But he doesn't make decisions.\"The US carries out dishonest elections, will bomb countries under any President and had no evidence behind blaming Russian hackers for rigging the 2017 presidential election in which Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, said Monson.He said the wide range of sanctions imposed on Russia were purely designed to \"terrify Russian citizens.\"\"They did not care about the starving children of Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, who were also sanctioned,\" he said.\"They were not provided with any humanitarian assistance. But now they have decided to take care of the Ukrainians. Funny.\"In fact, the US does not care about Ukrainian citizens. They impose sanctions on anyone they don't like.\"And who imposed sanctions on the United States for the bombing of other countries? Who banned American Paralympic athletes, figure skaters and so on from participating in competitions?\"No consequences. Because the US is a superpower backed by the dollar. Nobody says anything against them, no matter what they do.\"The USA is a country of hypocrisy. It is based on two things: the genocide of the Native Americans, the Indians who lived there for thousands of years \u2013 they took away their lands, resources.\"And then there were black slaves who were exploited, bought and sold. That is, the US is based on genocide and slavery.\"And now they are teaching the whole world to live. In fact, they colonize other countries, taking their resources. The US uses people in the same Philippines, Indonesia and many other countries.\"With Europe, the same thing: Great Britain, Portugal, Spain, at the expense of the colonies, accumulated initial capital. The West is pumping trillions of dollars out of poor countries.\"I adhere to extreme left views, a completely different ideology\u00a0[to Putin].\u00a0But I believe that he loves Russia and that he is doing everything to make Russia better, based on his vision.\"On some points I agree with him but on others I don't. I also want the best for Russia: I want people to be happy, the borders to be safe and there to be normal relations with other countries. In this, we are similar.\"Monson fought for the UFC in 2000, 2002 and 2006 and lost to\u00a0Emelianenko's brother, Alexander, in a fist-fighting tournament in February.The powerhouse said that his experiences in Ukraine gave him a keen understanding of its history and what was happening there, claiming that Ukrainians welcomed the Nazis during the Second World War, who he said swiftly turned on them to deadly effect.\"And now it is denied,\" he rued. \"The USA and Europe support fascism in Ukraine.\"You just need to understand the reasons why monuments are being destroyed. Not because they want a better future for Ukraine, equality. The Nazis want to rewrite history.\"Monson added on Instagram: \"We support Ukraine but we do not support the people of Donbass that Ukraine has been bombing for the past\u00a0eight years without stopping. It is popular right now to support Ukraine.\"We don\u2019t know anything about Ukraine\u2019s genocide against the civilians in Donbass because the media never mentions it.

The spokesman went on to say that the agenda also included the issue of Western sanctions. The officials also expressed dismay at the sluggishness of the Ukrainian side to effectively participate in the negotiation process. On 24 February, Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian provocations. In response to Russia's operation, Western countries have rolled out a comprehensive sanctions campaign against Moscow.

It was later confirmed that the 23-year-old, who is the son of F1 icon Michael, was uninjured but this Haas team pulled him from the race as a precaution.However, Schumacher's high velocity accident reignited criticisms from some drivers, including Hamilton's Mercedes teammate George Russell, that the track was designed with entertainment in mind more-so than driver safety, with Russell referring to it as a \"recipe for disaster.\"Hamilton, though, said that now that both his and Formula 1's obligations in Saudi Arabia had been fulfilled, he was looking forward to putting the event in his rear-view mirror.\u00a0\u201cI am so happy the weekend is done,\u201d he said after the race, which was won by Hamilton's title rival Max Verstappen.\u00a0\u201cI am so happy that everyone is safe, I am just looking forward to getting out.

In separate tweets, Dotcom appeared to have shown what some of his followers deemed veiled support of Moscow in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. In one particular tweet, the blogger rolled out his own statement regarding the crisis. Dotcom additionally slammed the calls by Washington to charge Russia with war crimes at the International Criminal Court (ICC) - \"the same Court the US Govt legislated against to stop its war crimes from being prosecuted\", as he put it. Released in 2016, \"Ukraine on Fire\" was labelled on YouTube (although it remains accessible) after the platform deemed that it breached its policy on violent content, so the film was uploaded on Rumble for free. Featuring director Oliver Stone, the movie details the development of Ukrainian nationalism. The movie takes a particular look into the events of 2014, when Kiev was rattled by the violent Maidan coup - the event that triggered Crimea's reunification with Russia, the war in Donbass, and contributed to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Since 24 February, Moscow has been carrying out a special military operation that was launched by the Kremlin to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" Ukraine. Moscow said it has no plans to occupy Ukraine, underlining that Russian troops are exclusively targeting military infrastructure there and pose no threat to civilians. The West has condemned the Russian operation, imposing a slew of sanctions targeting Russia's economy, media, culture, businesses, and politicians. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU's plan \"to break free from Russian fossil fuels,\" will be unveiled together with US President Joe Biden on Friday. Although the US can export more and Australia, which is sending a lot of gas to China, could ship more to Europe right now, it will likely not be sufficient, Sitton added. Center for LNG and the Natural Gas Supply Association spokesperson Daphne Magnuson told Sputnik on Thursday that the United States is increasing its capacity to export more LNG to the EU after the Energy Department recently approved several pending permits with more approvals coming.  Magnuson also underscored that the US is well-positioned to continue to provide the European Union with liquefied natural gas at the time being. Last week, the US authorized LNG exports from two current operating export facilities in the states of Louisiana and Texas. Earlier in March, Biden announced a US-only ban on Russian oil imports although the United States imports much less oil from Russia than European states, which have been leery of imposing similar restrictions. Before Biden departed for Europe this week, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told Sky News the US would not ask Europe to fully abandon Russian energy supplies. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed Gazprom to change existing gas contracts into rubles in response to the EU, US, and Japan blocking Russia from accessing euros, dollars and yen. The announcement caused the Russian currency to climb against the dollar while global gas prices jumped. Meanwhile, International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol described Putin\u2019s order as a \"security threat.\" However, Sitton said Moscow's demand for European countries to purchase Russian gas in rubles should not have a massive impact on energy prices. Sitton predicts the price of Russian crude oil might actually go down a little bit while they slightly increase elsewhere. Natural gas prices were surging on the European market late last year, spurred by growing energy demand amid an economic recovery after months of lockdowns, as well as a limited supply. This has prompted the EU authorities to reinforce efforts toward ensuring the bloc's energy security, the need for which has become even more pressing during the conflict with Russia, the EU's main energy supplier, over the latter's special military operation in Ukraine.

However, another, regular, procedure on the issue is still in play.\u00a0This means that the decision doesn't amount to an outright refusal to lift sanctions imposed by Brussels, but rather prevents an interim lifting of restrictions before a final decision.\u00a0\u201cThe President of the Court considers in this respect that the information provided does not allow us to assess whether the damage invoked has a social dimension,\u201d the court said in statement.The French version of the RT TV channel was banned from broadcasting in the European Union in early March, following the launch of Russia\u2019s military offensive in Ukraine. The outlet protested the decision, saying that the censorship would lead to \u201cdramatic\u201d economic, financial, and human consequences. It also asked that its request to lift the ban be urgently assessed.The court ruled that RT France had refrained from \u201cexplaining its financial situation\u201d and had not provided \u201cspecific figures\u201d to support its claims about the \u201cthe serious and irreparable nature of its financial loss.\u201dRegarding reputational damage that resulted from the EU Council\u2019s decision, the court refuted this, arguing that the channel had been labeled as \u201cRussian state-controlled media\u201d even before the ban and its reputation was already affect\u00a0RT France\u2019s argument that banning the channel contradicts democratic principles of free speech was also not enough to persuade the court, which concluded that the case was not one requiring \u201curgency.\u201dIt also stated that \u201cthe balance of interests in question tilts in favor of the Council\u201d since the measures imposed on RT \u201crelate to the need to protect member states against disinformation and destabilization campaigns\u201d which the EU has accused RT of carrying out.The court concluded, however, that \u201cgiven the exceptional circumstances,\u201d it would rule according to an \u201caccelerated procedure,\u201d so that the broadcaster would get a response \u201cas soon as possible.\u201dRT France Editor-in-Chief Ksenia Fedorova condemned the tribunal\u2019s response, saying that the decision not to \u201cfast-track\u201d the outlet\u2019s lawsuit was taken by the court\u2019s president \u201csingle-handedly and without a hearing.\u201d\u00a0She also said that, among the reasons behind its refusal for an urgent consideration of RT\u2019s claim, was the fact that the EU \u201cdoes not prevent broadcasting outside the European Union, including in French-speaking Africa,\u201d or the implementation of the \u201cother activities\u201d of RT France in the EU, in addition to broadcasting.Another lawsuit by RT France will be considered by the Grand Chamber of the EU Tribunal, Fedorova said.The European Council\u2019s decision to ban RT France was condemned by the French National Union of Journalists, which called it \u201ca dangerous precedent for the freedom of the press in Europe.\u201dMeanwhile, Fedorova also said that several Russian employees of RT France have had their personal payroll accounts blocked by Societe General bank.\u201cThis is real discrimination based on nationality.

But it is early in the conflict, other officials caution, and that conclusion may prove premature,\u201d the newspaper\u00a0detailed.Moscow launched its attack on Ukraine in late February, citing as reasons NATO\u2019s creeping expansion into the neighboring state, the bloc\u2019s refusal to provide security guarantees to Russia, and Kiev\u2019s failure to resolve the eight-year conflict with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.The US and Western powers called the move an act of unprovoked aggression. They imposed unprecedentedly harsh economic sanctions against Russia and pledged to ramp up arms supplies to Ukraine. Despite pleas from Kiev, the West refused to act militarily, citing concerns that it could result in a world war.Russia has said it considers the sanctions a form of warfare. This week, President Vladimir Putin announced that the country will demand payment in rubles rather than dollars or euros for the natural gas it sells to \u201cunfriendly nations,\u201d adding that Russia no longer trusts currencies controlled by the Western financial system.The list of unfriendly nations \u2013 the ones that have imposed sanctions against Russia \u2013 includes most European countries. The EU received around 40% of its gas supplies from Russia before the conflict broke out.Washington\u2019s belief that Russia may use nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons in Ukraine is based on the presumption that Moscow expected the Ukraine offensive to be short and is now at an impasse due to the resistance of the Ukrainian forces.

In an interview with British daily newspaper, the Financial Times, Gita Gopinath, the IMF's first deputy managing director, predicted the emergence of small currency blocks based on trade between separate groups of countries in response to measures taken by western nations against Russia. Western countries have imposed severe sanctions on Russian financial institutions, including the central bank, and frozen forex reserves worth around $300 billion stashed in US dollars. \"Countries tend to accumulate reserves in the currencies which they use to trade with the rest of the world, and in which they borrow from the rest of the world, so you might see some slow-moving trends towards other currencies playing a bigger role [in reserve assets],\" she observed. Gopinath's observations come days after the Reserve Bank of India voiced similar concerns, saying countries may choose to diversify their forex reserves away from US dollars in the wake of the US decision to freeze Russia's reserves. The IMF's economist noted a 10 percent reduction in the dollar's share of international reserves over the past two decades. The India-born economist also added that digital currency will get even \"greater attention since the recent episodes, which draws us to the question of international regulation\". Several experts also forecast increasing interest rates on US Treasury bonds, indicating a weakening inclination to store their reserves in US currency.  Ten-year bond yields jumped to 2.35 percent from 1.7 percent since Russia began a special military operation in Ukraine to demilitarise and de-Nazify the eastern European nation.

The moment came as he responded to criticism by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Orban called Kiev's stance to request NATO's involvement and weapons supplies understandable, but stressed that Hungary is not Ukraine or Russia and has its own interests that need to be defended. The prime minister added that both covert and overt discussions are constantly taking place on the matter of the EU and NATO's involvement in the conflict in Ukraine. He noted that Budapest is consistently being forced to defend its own interests and stressed the importance of a government that can do so, instead of simply obeying the will of other countries. Since the start of the Russian special operation in Ukraine to demilitarise and \"de-Nazify\" the country, Hungary has provided refuge to Ukrainians fleeing their homeland, but systematically refused to provide military assistance to Kiev or allow weapons shipments through its territory. This stance drew President Zelensky's criticism during his address to EU leaders during a virtual conference on 24 March. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk went even further rhetorically wondering if Budapest refuses to back new anti-Russian sanctions against the energy sector because it wants \"Russian gas with a discount\" or because it silently \"dreams of\" Transcarpathia \u2013 a region in Western Ukraine with a notable ethnic Hungarian minority. EU countries previously slapped Russia with harsh economic sanctions targeting its Central Bank, access to European financial markets, the Russian banking sector, as well as certain officials and businesses allegedly connected to the Kremlin. Brussels stopped short of banning Russian gas and oil purchases, but vowed to lower them by the end of the year. The bloc's leading politicians did not explain how they plan to replace the gas and oil supplies from Russia, which make up around one-third of overall energy shipments to the EU. Moscow recently responded to the sanctions by unveiling plans to make \"unfriendly nations\" pay for Russian natural gas and crude shipments using its national currency \u2013 the ruble.

The system would reportedly be deployed on Okinawa, in the Philippines, and Taiwan \u2013 a breakaway Chinese province \u2013 as a part of $27.4 billion in spending allocated for the Indo-Pacific theatre over the next six years. Beijing has repeatedly warned Washington against selling weapons to Taiwan and has called such actions unacceptable. Kim Dotcom argued that even if the Ukraine crisis doesn't trigger a global one, US plans to deploy missiles around China definitely would. Back in March 2021, then-US top commander for the Indo-Pacific region Admiral Philip Davidson mentioned in his testimony before a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that Washington hoped to create a network of launch sites around China, brandishing land-based long-range missiles. Furthermore, an unclassified Indo-Pacific Command budget document, submitted to the Senate committee, confirmed that Taiwan and other islands, such as Okinawa and the Senkakus, are being looked at as potential sites for the missiles. The goal of the system is stated as being a deterrence against \"acts of aggression or coercion\" targeting US allies. Specifically, the Pentagon was concerned about Beijing's alleged plans to seize Taiwan by force, Davidson said. He elaborated that according to the estimates, China might make a move in that direction within the decade, or at the earliest in six years, the admiral predicted. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Heavily promoted in advance as a vital lifeline to Kiev that would safeguard citizens, defend refugees, and protect \"democracy,\"references to the supposedly landmark move immediately vanished from the mainstream media following its White House approval, and have remained absent ever since.One explanation for this informational deficit could well be that in reality, the legislation serves no tangible benevolent ends of any kind, in fact providing an effective blank cheque for proxy war, and untrammelled embezzlement by US government agencies and contractors.This much is certain from a precursory analysis of the bill\u2019s lengthy underlying text. The term \u201cmilitary\u201d crops up over 350 times, \u201chumanitarian\u201d just 58. What\u2019s more, almost half the headline $13.6 billion wellspring ($6.5 billion) has already been allocated - to cover the cost of weapons shipments to Ukraine and the buildup of NATO forces in January and February this year. In other words, before the war had even formally begun.Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reports published in the weeks prior to the war commencing highlight some of the gruesome purposes to which this \u201clethal aid\u201d may have been put. In one representative filing on February 18, its investigators documented how a kindergarten in breakaway Lugansk had been struck by shrapnel, while 20 children were being taught inside. Luckily, they all escaped uninjured.The same report noted that, \u201cin violation of withdrawal lines,\u201d OSCE observers identified placement of surface-to-air-missile systems, howitzers, anti-tank guns and multiple-launch rocket systems in government-controlled areas of Donetsk. Neither this blatantly belligerent activity, nor the Organization recording how the overwhelming majority of missile and rocket attacks carried out in the days leading up to Russia's military attack\u00a0were targeted at breakaway areas by government forces, has ever been mentioned by a Western news outlet.This may be partially explained by the US, UK and Canada pulling out of the OSCE mission in Ukraine in mid-February, allegedly due to fears of an impending Russian assault \u2013 another rationale for the English-speaking trio\u2019s withdrawal could be that revealing the reality of egregious government abuses in Eastern Ukraine was problematic, and politically unpopular at home.The mainstream code of silence on such crimes against humanity is no longer rigorously maintained. In fact, many current and former Western officials have been unabashed in confirming Washington\u2019s overriding priority is arming Kiev to the teeth, to foment a protracted insurrection and trap Russia in a bloodspattered quagmire, in the manner of the Soviet-Afghan War.This comparison was drawn favorably by US lawmaker Adam Smith, House Armed Services Committee chair, after legislation to establish a \u201cUkraine Resistance Fund\u201d was recently drafted. Speaking to MSNBC on February 28, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton echoed his endorsement, stating \u201cthe model that people are now looking toward\u201d in respect of the Ukraine crisis is the \u201carmed insurgency [that] basically drove the Russians [sic] out of Afghanistan.\u201dIronically, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was ordered by a Ukrainian, Leonid Brezhnev, back in 1979.Washington\u2019s shameful experience of funding, arming and training the Afghan resistance is much-venerated in modern US foreign policy circles today, despite the strategy creating the conditions that led to the tragedy of 9\/11, on the alleged basis it was fundamental to the fall of Communism. However, many mainstream historians - and indeed the CIA\u2019s then-Soviet Affairs chief - largely or completely discount the Afghan war as a factor in the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse.In its defense, the \u201caid\u201d bill contains some protocols related to food and medical aid, although details on what will be sent to whom and where are troublingly unforthcoming.The State Department is afforded lone responsibility for deciding every aspect of distribution, with no apparent obligation on the part of officials to publicly account for any allocations - raising the obvious prospect that the intended beneficiaries of this ostensibly humanitarian disbursement could well be soldiers, mercenaries or guerilla fighters.Conversely, it could be that these projects are concerned with selling inflammatory, indirect US intervention in the Ukraine crisis to its own population, on a false prospectus.This was very much the case with \u2018aid\u2019 projects during the two-decade-long Western occupation of Afghanistan, as a withering August 2021 official review of US reconstruction efforts in the country during that deplorable period made abundantly clear. The appraisal found the amount of money being spent on reconstruction projects, such as the creation of new hospitals, was \u201cthe most important measure of success\u201d for US officials - rather than the projects being worthwhile or even remotely viable.In turn, false claims of those projects\u2019 \u2018success\u2019 were then fed to US lawmakers and citizens in order to convince them that Washington\u2019s ongoing, costly presence in Afghanistan wasn\u2019t the total, counterproductive failure it actually was. This \u201cinstitutional drive to produce good news stories\u201d produced a situation in which Washington spent money \u201cfaster than it could be accounted for,\u201d so as to generate positive press coverage \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201dAs part of this cynical push, representatives of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) were frequently \u201cbulldozed\u201d by their military counterparts into pursuing projects in areas of Afghanistan \u201cfar too dangerous for them to have a stabilizing effect.\u201d In essence, the bigger the associated risks, the greater the \u2018success\u2019 that could be claimed.The Agency was therefore forced to depend on contractors, and \u201csometimes unable to establish with confidence even the most basic information\u201d about a project\u2019s progress as a result. Despite this, USAID\u2019s reliance on these external actors endured unabated, creating a cottage industry of companies willing to defraud the Agency, and suppliers eager to help them do it.On the subject of USAID, the organization is frequently referenced in the new aid bill, for example sharing a $145-million slush fund of \u201caid to independent media, journalists and civil activists\u201d and counteract \u201cdisinformation and provide factual data about the situation in Ukraine\u201d with the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), parent of the\u00a0CIA-created\u00a0state-run\u00a0outlets Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, among others.USAID\u2019s status as a \u201chumanitarian\u201d organization has long-been questioned, with many charging that it acts as an effective CIA front. A proposal published by the Agency\u2019s internal \u201cglobal development lab\u201d in February 2019 should surely put to bed any doubts that it doesn\u2019t.The paper advocated for USAID staffers to be trained as special operations forces in order for them to effectively and intimately collaborate with military and intelligence agencies, so they act as \u201csuper enablers\u201d and optimally serve US \u201cnational security\u201d interests through \u201ca mix of offensive, defensive, and stability operations in extremis conditions.\u201dWith the US spending more on defense than the next 11 countries combined, and the White House having just requested a $31-billion war chest for the 2022\/23 financial year, bringing the total budget to $813 billion, it\u2019s no wonder Washington only views matters through a military lens. It has no other choice."},{"uuid":"e18ae529-ff86-4a54-8414-33eeb43217db","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552930-biden-cheat-sheet-putin\/","title":"Photo shows Biden's Putin 'cheat sheet'","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6243379020302712ed2a4512.jpg","subtitle":"The president\u2019s detractors have repeatedly questioned his mental fitness","content":"After publicly appearing to call for the ouster of his Russian counterpart\u00a0Vladimir Putin, US President Joe Biden read from a pre-prepared \u2018cheat sheet,\u2019 on Monday, in an attempt to assure\u00a0reporters that he wasn\u2019t actually suggesting regime change in Moscow.However, Biden, whose cognitive health Republicans say is declining, ended up doubling down on his original remarks.Speaking to reporters at the White House, the president\u00a0said that his declaration in Poland last week that Putin \u201ccannot remain in power\u201d was not a call for regime change in Moscow.\u201cI\u2019m not walking anything back,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI want to make it clear: I was not then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change.

Nobody believes that,\u201d Biden said.Biden\u2019s apparent befuddlement has already raised eyebrows several times in recent days. Whilst on his visit to Poland, the president seemingly told American soldiers that they would soon be deployed to Ukraine, before his officials walked back the statement, saying \u201cThe president has been clear we are not sending US troops to Ukraine and there is no change in that position.\u201dLikewise, despite Biden\u2019s Vice President, National Security Advisor, Secretary of State and Press Secretary all portraying US sanctions on Russia as a deterrent to Putin, Biden declared last week that \u201csanctions never deter.\u201dBiden has relied on printed answer cards when dealing with the press before, and has also called on reporters during press conferences from prepared lists, mentioning on one such occasion in November that \u201cthey gave me a list of the people I\u2019m going to call on.\u201dRepublicans have pointed to these incidents, as well as to examples of Biden losing his train of thought mid-reply and appearing visibly lost and confused, as indicators of the president\u2019s declining cognitive abilities.\u00a0Biden\u2019s approval rating sank to a new low of 40% in an NBC News poll published on Sunday, with just 29% of respondents expressing \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201cquite a bit\u201d of confidence in the president\u2019s ability to handle the crisis in Ukraine.

The Bulgarian PM said no.","content":"Bulgarian citizens rallied on Saturday against giving its \"few remaining weapons\" to Ukraine and demanded the withdrawal of NATO from the country. Demonstrators gathered in front of the Bulgarian Ministry of Defence, where Austin and Petkov met for a joint press conference, waving Bulgarian and Russian flags. They were heard chanting, \"NATO Out\". Similar protests took place in Rome and Piza, Italy, where activists of a major Italian trade union, USB, opposed sending weapons to Ukraine and called on the government to ditch NATO. While many NATO members have pledged to pump Ukraine with weapons, the Bulgarian government has not been particularly supportive of the idea, with Petkov dismissing reports that Sofia discussed the topic as \"fake news\".  \"We are working together to reinforce the eastern flank of NATO, but nothing more than that has been discussed\", he said. Bulgaria has been a member of NATO since 2004, when it along with several other Eastern European nations was welcomed into the alliance following the \"Big Bang\" enlargement round announced at the November 2002 Prague summit. On 24 February, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg announced that the alliance would be putting its ships and aircraft on high alert together with the reinforcement of NATO's eastern flank. However, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has desperately begged Western states to send troops to fight for Kiev, they have repeatedly stated that Ukraine is not a member of NATO (and is unlikely to be one in the near future), basically demonstrating that despite their rhetoric, the Ukrainian crisis is not their business.  Zelensky's request for a no-fly zone was also snubbed by the United States, as Washington has no desire to risk an open military confrontation with Russia. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Two conditions inserted into the agreement were unacceptable to the Serbian side, according to the publicist: first, was a binding referendum on Kosovo independence three years after the signing of the agreement; second, the free movement of NATO personnel under arms through the territory of Serbia itself, to have access to Kosovo.

It was former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger who admitted in an interview with the UK Daily Telegraph on June 28, 1999: \"The Rambouillet text, which called on Serbia to admit NATO troops throughout Yugoslavia, was a provocation, an excuse to start bombing.\" According to RAND's 2001 study, titled European Contribution to Operation Allied Force, NATO's military planners started preparing for a possible operation in Kosovo in May and June 1998. NATO was tasked to develop a wide range of alternative options, from preventive deployments to a full ground invasion to stop the Yugoslavian government from preventing Kosovo's secession. Then-US Senator Joe Biden was an ardent proponent of a NATO invasion of Yugoslavia. \u201cIf I were president, I would just bomb Serbian President Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107,\u201d Biden said in October 1998. \"The bombing was intended to destroy Serbia as an independent country, to occupy 15% of its sovereign territory and eventually recognise the secession of that territory as an independent country in its own right,\" says Srdja Trifkovic. \"So one could say, with equal validity, that if there was a headline in the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter in Berlin on 22 of June 1941, that the Wehrmacht was opening the door to peace in the East, that's exactly the same validity. The cover of Time claimed that what NATO had done was opening the door to peace.\" The Clinton administration's bombing campaign targeted not only the Yugoslavian armed forces. According to some estimates, NATO destroyed or damaged some 25,000 residential buildings, 470 km of roads, 595 km of railway infrastructure, 14 airports, 19 hospitals, 20 health centers, 69 schools, 18 kindergartens, 176 cultural monuments and 38 bridges, causing up to $100 billion in economic losses. NATO aggression provoked a humanitarian disaster and an ethnic cleansing of the Serbs, according to Sljukic: \"They were forced to leave their homes and become refugees in their own country,\" he notes. NATO crimes against Serbs in Yugoslavia have never been thoroughly investigated and those responsible had never been held accountable, according to some observers. US-NATO military moves in Europe did not end with carving out Kosovo, dismantling Yugoslavia and redrawing the European map. Having got away with an illegal bombing campaign, the Western military bloc continued its march to the east, welcoming new members and deploying weapons on Russia's doorstep, according to scholars. \"NATO expansion to the east has, as many predicted, led precisely to what we see today \u2013 the conflict between Russia and Ukraine,\" claims Kovalik. \"The US clearly wanted that conflict, it did everything it could to bring it about and is now trying to prevent peace at all costs.\" There are parallels between NATO's invasion of Yugoslavia and a similar move by the Kremlin in Ukraine, according to the observers. The member states of the western military bloc turned a blind eye to eight years of Ukrainian shelling in Donbass and widely-reported neo-Nazi battalions, according to Srdja Trifkovic. In a similar vein, the US and its allies gloss over the crimes by the KLA, \"in the complete avoidance of any discussion of extremely valid Serbian arguments, both historical and legal,\" he notes. What is driving the US-led NATO bloc is American exceptionalism that has, since WWII, been \"the most dangerous doctrine in the world,\" stresses Kovalik. \"[This doctrine] has justified some of the most brutal wars, such as those against Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Panama and Syria, in the name of ''democracy and freedom' when the goal of these wars was anything but,\" the academic offered.

Scotland are 12 places behind them but have won their last four competitive matches at home, while Wales are ranked 18th and were inspired by four-time Champions League winner Gareth Bale in their 2-1 semifinal win over Austria in Cardiff.Former Dynamo Kiev assistant\u00a0Petrakov was appointed as Ukraine legend Andriy Shevchenko's successor in August, overseeing the end of an unbeaten qualification campaign in which only World Cup holders France finished ahead of his team.\"We still have April and May to come and we will see what happens then. We are supposed to playing Scotland in June as well as Nations League games,\" Petrakov told Football 1 via ESPN this week. \"But we can't think about them at the moment given the current situation.\"Petrakov has also vowed never to speak Russian again despite\u00a0describing the language\u00a0as his mother tongue."},{"uuid":"e53907a1-5cfe-41af-a9a5-c9013f3b2fab","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220327\/majority-of-brits-expect-heating-energy-bill-problems-poll-shows-1094230440.html","title":"Majority of Brits Expect Heating, Energy Bill Problems, Poll Shows","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e6\/03\/1b\/1094230299_0:0:2364:1576_1440x900_80_0_1_35194e805ae637645a747185fba80a09.jpg?source-sid=reuters_photo","subtitle":"LONDON (Sputnik) - Over two-thirds of Britons say they will struggle to pay their soaring heating and energy bills, a new survey has revealed.","content":"The poll, carried out by Techne for the Sunday Express, found that the cost of living is the top concern for 58 percent of British people. Out of the 1,642 surveyed individuals, 67 percent said they will have problems paying for heating and energy. More than 80 percent said they are going to avoid making large purchases, while 55 percent plan to cut spending on leisure activities and 37 percent will try to save on clothes. Only 31 percent of those surveyed listed Ukraine as a top concern. About a third of respondents said the Ukraine crisis and the Western anti-Russia sanctions, which are leading to spikes in gas and oil prices, will push back the date they can retire, according to the Sunday Express survey. The living standards think tank Resolution Foundation on Thursday warned that 1.3 million people in the UK will be pushed into absolute poverty after the government failed to help low-income families cope with the cost-of-living crisis in the so-called Spring Statement made by Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak. On Wednesday, Sunak announced a 5 pence per litre cut in fuel duty and an increase in the threshold at which people pay national insurance contributions, benefiting around 30 million workers with a tax cut worth more than \u00a3330 ($435).

But it\u2019s also been totally unsurprising,\u201d she said on Friday.While explaining that India had strengthened its ties with Russia for its own safety as its relationship with China deteriorated, the American diplomat suggested the country was now thinking \u201clong and hard\u201d about its decision to cozy up to Moscow and suggested the US should focus on providing India with \u201coptions.\u201d This she characterized as \u201cproviding for its strategic autonomy,\u201d though her approach seemed aimed at driving India directly into the arms of the US and NATO rather than giving it any \u2018autonomy\u2019 in the matter.Rapp-Hooper suggested Washington not stop at trying to talk India out of buying Russian armaments, noting that \u201cwe have a number of partners that have chosen to keep their chips in with Russia, in terms of their defense procurement, in part as a hedge against China.\u201d These countries are now rethinking those decisions and need replacements for those weapons systems, she said, implying the US should guide them toward purchasing its own systems or those built by allies.New Delhi buys more weapons from Russia than any other country, having purchased almost half (49.3%) of its arms from Moscow for what has amounted to $6.5 billion over the last five years. This has unsurprisingly rubbed Washington the wrong way, leading it to threaten sanctions over India\u2019s 2018 purchase of Russia\u2019s S-400 missile defense system.While India has canceled several other weapons orders from Russia in the wake of the Ukraine offensive, including MiG-29 fighters, helicopters and anti-tank weapons, Washington is hoping to use the previous purchases as leverage to convince India to further distance itself from Moscow. New Delhi has thus far declined to join in the sanctions pile-on against Russia, and has not explicitly condemned its actions in Ukraine.However, some have worried that the US sanctioning India will drive it away from the Quad alliance, which includes Japan and Australia and is aimed at reining in China\u2019s influence in the Asia-Pacific region."},{"uuid":"e558b64c-776b-4b44-9bad-68c2b4799bc2","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/shows\/crosstalk\/552923-russia-ukraine-negotiations-possibility\/","title":"CrossTalk on Ukraine: Negotiated end?","image":null,"subtitle":"nan","content":"Is peace at hand?

Ukraine\u2019s bid to join NATO was one of the reasons Moscow said it launched a military campaign against the country last month.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German and French brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc.

The Financial Times (FT) called Biden's line about Putin a \"turning point\" in America's approach to the conflict in Ukraine. Prior, Washington had tried to balance its rhetoric, while now it's transitioned to a \"fierce strategic rivalry\" with Russia. The head of the US Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Haass, criticised Biden's closing line about Putin, noting that ousting the Russian president is not something Washington has the tools to accomplish. At the same time, the president's speech created risks that Putin will \"reject compromise, escalate, or both\", Haass warned. Michael Goodwin, a contributor for the New York Post, condemned the entire Biden speech and specifically targeted his line about Putin. Goodwin argued that it would \"dramatically raise the stakes with Russia\" as the US administration was seeking to lower them. Joe Biden's entire speech, which was dedicated to the topic of a \"long war\" and rarely touched upon peace, suggests that a \"new Cold War [is] on our hands\" with POTUS as its Western leader, David Gergen, a former White House adviser, told the Financial Times. Gergen cautioned that such a speech heavily suggests that the current conflict won't be \"settled at the negotiating table\". Even before Biden could depart Poland, where he delivered his speech, the White House was quick to rescind its last line \u2013 about Vladimir Putin \u2013 and assured that POTUS was not calling for regime change in Russia. Furthermore, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tried to interpret Biden's words differently the next day, claiming that POTUS meant that \"Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression\". Western commentators, however, remained unconvinced, warning that the same is likely to be true for the Kremlin, and harshly criticised \u2013 either Biden for making reckless comments off the cuff or his team for allowing such a line in the text of the speech. FT suggested that even a single hint that Washington is contemplating regime change in Moscow might prompt the Kremlin to believe that the US is \"losing control of its message about the war\". Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, insisted that Biden's message will be strongly believed in Moscow. Haass stated that the line being off-script (something that has not yet been officially confirmed), will only reinforce the Kremlin's fears as it will consider Biden's words \"this man cannot remain in power\" as his genuine belief. Putin heard a call for regime change \"loud and clear\" in Biden's speech, former Defence Intelligence Agency officer, Rebekah Koffler, told Fox News. She claimed that Putin has long suspected the US of trying to stage a \"colour revolution\" or a civil uprising in Russia, and now he's got his confirmation. Koffler lashed out at the controversial line in Biden's script and called the people who prepared it \"incompetent\", since this phrase failed to \"minimise security threats\" for the American people. New York Post contributor Michael Goodwin stressed that in the context of Biden's speech in Poland, his phrase about Putin not being allowed to \"remain in power\" is impossible to be comprehended as anything but a call for regime change. The White House might explain itself in the future, but it will never be \"good enough\", Goodwin warned. The Biden administration, for example, the national security adviser or the secretary of state, must reach out to Moscow and elaborate on Joe Biden's comment, Richard Haass said. They must explain to the Kremlin that the comment was made in the heat of the moment and that it in no way reflects US foreign policy, the president of the think tank suggested.

Pauken II, a Beijing-based Asia-Pacific affairs commentator and author of US vs. China: From Trade War to Reciprocal Deal. \"Anytime a nation anticipates the US will rupture bilateral relations with them, the rival nations to the US will demand a withdrawal of their foreign currency and gold reserves from Wall Street banks. The nation making the request will spark a banking panic as bankers will know the other sovereign government is planning to hit the US with tough actions. But, if Wall Street bankers refuse to hand over the reserves to the proper owners, you could deem it an 'act of war'\". Pauken does not rule out that many countries that don\u2019t trust the US \"will start to slowly and quietly take out their reserves\u2019 holdings from Wall Street banks\". Consequently, US and European banks will see a trend of foreign nations stopping their business dealings with them and moving their cash back home or to Asian banks, such as in Singapore, according to the Beijing-based commentator. Russia's assets were frozen on 28 February, after Moscow invoked Article 51 of the UN Charter and launched the special operation to de-militarise and de-Nazify Ukraine on 24 February. On 11 March, US President Joe Biden signed an order banning the sale or delivery by any other means of dollar-denominated banknotes to Russia. The move accelerated the process of the de-dollarisation of the Russian economy that has been ongoing since 2014, when the US and its NATO partners went on a sanctions spree in response to Crimea's reunification with Russia. On 18 March, members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), which includes Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan, agreed on a phased transition to settlements in national currencies, according to the head of the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation Maxim Reshetnikov. Earlier, Russia started bilateral trade in national currencies with China, India, Turkey, and Iran. Moscow also diversified its Central Bank's reserves: by mid-2021, just 16.4% of Russia's national wealth was held in US dollars, according to Reuters. Although Russia's de-dollarisation does not pose an immediate threat to the greenback's dominance, according to financial observers, the Biden administration's decision to freeze Russia's assets definitely does. According to Rowley, if central bank assets held in US dollars are no longer inviolate, then other countries could eventually be pushed into \"dumping reserve dollars and cutting dollar reliance in trade, finance and banking\". Another SCMP contributor, Neal Kimberley, a British financial expert and FOREX analyst, shares similar concerns. Kimberley warns that Beijing \"itself might feel that further diversification of China\u2019s $3.2 trillion of foreign reserves would be appropriate\". Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal broke on 15 March that Saudi Arabia is apparently considering pricing some of its oil sales to China in yuan. The WSJ also reported about an upcoming visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Saudi Arabia, \"citing people familiar with the plan\". Both WSJ pieces are referring to the strained relations between Saudi Arabia and, in particular, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and the Biden administration. While The Hill notes that Riyadh used to threaten Washington with moving away from the US dollar in oil trade when US-Saudi relations became tense, Bloomberg suggests that this time Riyadh could have another motive. If Riyadh and Beijing decide to use the yuan in mutual oil trade, it's good news for them, deems Pauken. \"Both countries have little trust in the Biden administration\", the Beijing-based commentator says. \"They anticipate Washington will impose tough economic sanctions on them sooner or later, so they are taking the right steps to overcome the challenges that could await them. By settling energy trade in yuan, they can ignore US-led sanctions\". Washington's move to freeze Russia's dollar assets is likely to trigger a domino effect with other nations diversifying the composition of their own reserves, writes Neal Kimberley in his SCMP op-ed. Eventually, this will result in \"worldwide economic and financial change\", he forecasts.

This bodes ill for Norway, for which seafood is a major source of income trailing only oil and gas.","content":"As an unexpected consequence, Russia's special operation in Ukraine and ensuing wave of sanctions and countersanctions have sparked massive problems for Norwegian seafood exports. As the airspace over Russia is closed to European aircraft, the transport of goods to the lucrative Asian market must take a major detour south. Longer routes to reach delivery points force cargo planes to take on board much more fuel, which, in turn, means that they can carry less. Getting fresh seafood, one of Norway's key exports trailing only oil and gas, to their important markets in Asia is a top priority for shipping companies. However, the detour coupled with the fact that Russian shipping companies are now unavailable have greatly reduced the capacity of the freight market. This leads to challenges for the Norwegian seafood industry, as the huge Asian market is the most important for fresh and frozen seafood. Additionally, Russia itself is a major importer of shrimp, Atlantic salmon, and trout. Since the Russian airline AirBridgeCargo is no longer allowed to pick up seafood at Oslo Airport with its jumbo jets due to a comprehensive ban, freight operator DB Schenker has calculated that the capacity for shipping to Asia has decreased by 40 to 50 percent, forcing prices to skyrocket. According to DB Schenker communications manager Nils-Petter Buer, the use of southern routes alone to bypass Russian and Ukrainian airspace yields a delay of two hours per flight. Fuel prices have also risen dramatically amid the conflict. Yet another headache for Norwegian exports is that China, one of its main markets, is now hit by anti-pandemic measures and import bans. \"Shanghai, which is the largest import port and aviation hub in mainland China, is now closed for imports\", DB Schenker air freight manager Morten W\u00fcrgler concluded. The fish and seafood industry is of paramount importance in Norway. With its vast coastline, the oblong country provides ample conditions for domestic fishing and aquaculture. In recent years, revenues generated by fisheries and processing industry have soared. In 2018, the fish and seafood industry reached its highest profit, amounting to approximately 6.5 billion euros ($7.15 billion). The fisheries and aquaculture industry is Norway's largest export industry after oil and gas, with products from captured and farmed fish exported to over 150 countries. Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, after an appeal from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, who have been suffering an eight-year-long war waged against them by Kiev. President Vladimir Putin stressed that Russia's goal was to protect the people of Donbass and that the op aims at the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine.

The announcement came as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan leverages his ties with both countries in an effort to end the ongoing conflict.Initial reports suggest that the sides will sit down at the negotiations table on Monday and continue discussions until Wednesday. However, David Arakhamia, the majority leader of Ukraine's parliament and chief negotiator for Kiev, later clarified that the talks were scheduled to kick off in Turkey's largest city at 10am local time on Tuesday.The Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov also said that he doubted that the meeting would take place on Monday and said Tuesday is a more likely date. The summit in Istanbul was announced by Arakhamia on Sunday. The negotiations are again giving Ankara a prominent role in the process. Turkey hosted the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine in Antalya earlier this month.As a NATO member, the country has tried to walk a fine line between condemning Russia\u2019s military offensive in Ukraine and maintaining its close economic and defense ties with Moscow. Ankara has opposed Western sanctions against Russia, but it also rejected a request to allow Russian warships to sail through the Turkish Straits into the Black Sea.Speaking at the Doha Forum on Sunday, Erdogan\u2019s spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, cautioned against isolating Moscow, acknowledging that Russia \u201cmust be heard one way or another.\u201d He added, \u201cIf everybody burns bridges with Russia, then who\u2019s going to talk to them, at the end of the day?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Erdogan reportedly urged Putin in a telephone call on Sunday to bring about a ceasefire and improve humanitarian conditions in Ukraine.Turkey\u2019s position is similar to that of South Africa, where President Cyril Ramaphosa has resisted international pressure to take a tougher anti-Moscow stance and has called for negotiations. Ramaphosa has also offered to mediate Russia-Ukraine peace talks, and said last week that NATO was at least partly to blame for causing the conflict.\u201cThe war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region,\u201d the South African president said.Russia\u00a0attacked neighboring Ukraine last month, following a seven-year standoff over Kiev\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Moscow\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.

The gesture of solidarity appeared to serve a secondary objective of confirming that the Ukrainian president has remained in Kiev, disproving speculation that his daily video appearances were somehow being falsified.Britain has been one of the most vocal supporters of Ukraine both before and during the ongoing security crisis. Last week, Johnson had Zelensky speak to the heads of NATO allies from Nordic and Baltic nations, who had gathered in London for an event.

General Eric Vidaud was fired just seven months after getting the job, allegedly for being blindsided by Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine.Vidaud was appointed military intelligence chief last summer. He previously headed the French Special Operations Command (COS) and was credited with the killing of the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in June 2020.According to French media, the general\u2019s short tenure at the helm of military intelligence was ended by the mismanagement of the Ukraine crisis and the government\u2019s intention to drastically reorganize the agency in the wake of Russia\u2019s attack on the country, last month.The termination was first reported by the newspaper L\u2019Opinion and later covered by other outlets, including\u00a0state-backed Agence France-Presse (AFP). They cited sources familiar with the situation.According to AFP, rumors about Vidaud\u2019s imminent resignation were circulating in the French military for several days. Some expected him to receive another high-ranking position, but apparently the general will not have that option.Earlier this month, the chief of staff of the French Army, General Thierry Burkhard, told Le Monde that French intelligence failed to predict Russia\u2019s military operation, unlike their American counterparts.One source cited by AFP suggested that sacking the DRM chief over Ukraine was not particularly reasonable, because the agency\u2019s job is to assess military capabilities, not the intentions of foreign governments \u2013 and the agency correctly said Russia had the means to attack Ukraine.\u201cWe can\u2019t boil this change of leadership down to the Ukrainian situation alone. It is also about reorganizing the service,\u201d the source said.The news agency said the Ukraine crisis is making the French government rethink how it treats military intelligence. It will likely have a more prominent role as a geopolitical tool in the future, so relevant reforms are required in the agency supplying it, according to an expert cited by AFP."},{"uuid":"eb198f86-25c4-430f-a475-2cf15f617ac4","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552798-australia-china-ambassador-morrison\/","title":"Australian PM explains refusal to meet China\u2019s envoy","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/62406dc42030273a472d0fb4.jpg","subtitle":"It would be a sign of \u201cweakness\u201d after Beijing\u2019s suspension of minister-to-minister talks, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said","content":"Scott Morrison declined to meet with China\u2019s new ambassador to Australia earlier this month because it would have been a sign of \u201cweakness\u201d after Beijing suspended ministerial engagement, the prime minister has explained.Earlier this week, local media reported that Morrison had recently declined a formal request for a meeting from China\u2019s new envoy, Xiao Qian.\u201cSo long as China continues to refuse to have dialogue with Australian ministers and the prime minister, I think that\u2019s an entirely proportional response,\u201d Morrison said as he explained his decision to journalists on Saturday.\u201cThat would be a demonstration of weakness and I can assure you as prime minister that\u2019s the last message I\u2019d ever send to China,\u201d he insisted.With Beijing blocking minister-to-minister contacts, \u201cAustralians would see it as very inappropriate for me to engage in that dialogue with an ambassador,\u201d the prime minister stated.Xiao eventually ended up holding talks with Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne. This did not result in any diplomatic breakthrough, but still became the most high-profile meeting between officials from the two Pacific rivals in almost two years.During his meetings with private-sector representatives in recent weeks, the ambassador relayed a message to the Australian authorities from Chinese President Xi Jinping: \u201cAustralia has been treating China like the enemy. Australia has to decide whether it is China\u2019s enemy or China\u2019s friend.\u201dThis will likely be a complicated decision for Canberra, considering the recent leak of a draft security deal between China and the Solomon Islands, which could well see Beijing establishing a naval base in the Oceania region. Morrison said the development was of \u201cgreat concern across the Pacific family.\u201dAustralia maintains strong influence in the Solomon Islands, providing it with financial aid and security. The Australian military and police are set to remain in the country until December 2023 after being deployed there in 2019 to help quell riots that were provoked by the local government\u2019s decision to switch diplomatic ties from Taiwan to Beijing.Canberra also recently slammed Beijing for its \u201cchilling silence\u201d regarding the Russian military operation in Ukraine and its refusal to introduce any sort of sanctions against Moscow.Meanwhile, China has been angered by Australia\u2019s participation in the AUKUS deal with the US and the UK, which was announced last year and is aimed at arming Canberra with a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.Relations between the two countries took a turn for the worse in 2020, deteriorating when Australia called for a global probe into the origins on Covid-19 and how it spread. Beijing, which had been vigorously rejecting attempts to pin the blame for the pandemic on it, responded by banning imports of some Australian products, including coal, barley and lobsters."},{"uuid":"e8be54ec-f4c0-453c-a754-a6bd2d3d5126","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552623-us-ukraine-experimental-drugs\/","title":"Russia claims US tested experimental drugs on Ukrainian soldiers","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623cc33b85f540451f6c7edd.jpg","subtitle":"The Russian military has raised new allegations of US-sponsored secretive research in Ukraine","content":"The US has been involved in testing experimental drugs on \u201cvolunteers\u201d from the ranks of the Ukrainian military, the commander of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Forces Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov alleged\u00a0during a media briefing on Thursday.The experimental drug testing came within the so-called UP-8 project, exposed by the Russian military earlier this month.\u201cWe continue to publish information about the research with the participation of Ukrainian military personnel. I would like to note that such work is prohibited in the United States and is carried out by the military outside of the country,\u201d the official stated.\u201cAccording to data published in the Bulgarian media, about 20 Ukrainian soldiers died during the experiments in the Kharkov laboratory alone, and another 200 were hospitalized,\u201d Kirillov added, while claiming that\u00a0\u201cmore than four thousand people\u201d were involved in the testing in Ukraine.The official presented a document, purportedly sent by a Ukrainian military attach\u00e9 in the US to the country\u2019s defense ministry in April last year. The document highlights a meeting between the attach\u00e9 and representatives of the US-Canadian company Skymount, which is involved in AI-related research.According to the document, the company demonstrated to the Ukrainian officials its solutions in long-range observation, as well as the Deep Drug AI, a system used for screening and developing drugs. The system \u201cperforms the work of 60-person years per day, greatly reducing the manual labor hours to generate new target molecules from existing, pre-approved drugs,\u201d according to its developers.\u201cThe received documents confirm an attempt to test previously untested drugs on [the Ukrainian soldiers]. We are talking about the screening system for pharmaceuticals \u2018Deep Drug\u2019, which have not passed the licensing procedure in the US and Canada,\u201d Kirillov stated.The particular cynicism of American sponsors lies in the fact that the developer, the Skymount company, offered to purchase the system on a commercial basis, despite the fact that employees of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine were involved as volunteers.Ukraine is not the first country to be used for US military-backed pharmaceutical research, Kirillov noted. In 2010, for instance, Indonesia shut down the US Navy Medical Center in Jakarta, which was apparently involved in a similar project, over \u201cnumerous violations,\u201d he added.Moscow raised the allegations of questionable US-sponsored pharmaceutical and biological research taking place in secretive laboratories scattered across Ukraine after it sent troops into the neighboring country late in February. The attack came following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.The German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.

The industry resource added that Gazprom only uses the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline, which runs across Russia, Belarus, Poland and Germany, as an extra route to balance deliveries. The long-term contract to use this pipeline expired in May 2020 and was not extended.The main pipeline delivering Russian gas to European consumers is Nord Stream, which runs along the Baltic Sea bed to Germany. Another route is via Ukraine\u2019s gas transit system. However, an auction of extra capacities through Ukraine\u2019s gas transit system was canceled on Monday, as no such capacity was offered by Ukraine.According to energy news site\u00a0Oilprice.com, Gazprom not booking any space for April on the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline suggests that Russia has no intention to raise its natural gas supply to Europe.The Russian energy giant has been blamed for artificially tightening European gas market by reducing its natural gas exports to the continent at the beginning of this year, compared to the same period in 2021.Gazprom has insisted that it is not to blame for the soaring prices of natural gas, as it fulfils its long-term contract obligations, adding that it has not received requests for additional volumes above contractual thresholds.Gazprom\u2019s figures show that its gas deliveries to Europe in the first two weeks of March were at the highest level since last August.Europe receives 40% of natural gas it needs from Russia but is now seeking to reduce its dependency by sourcing imports from other countries and scaling up renewables.

At the same time, the court order does not affect another Meta product \u2013 the messaging platform WhatsApp. The judge explained the decision by the fact that WhatsApp does not have the ability to publicly spread illegal information.

The prosecution argued that Meta's activities on the two social media platforms were aimed against Russia and its armed forces. Meta's lawyers at the Tverskoy district court said that they had altered their guidelines and banned all forms of Russophobia and calls for discrimination against Russian civilians, as well as calls for killing heads of government.

Record surges in global gas prices have already driven a 54 percent energy price cap rise. After it is raised on 1 April by regulator Ofgem, bills will increase by around \u00a3693 ($913), from \u00a31,277 to \u00a31,971 for those on default tariffs paying by direct debit, affecting 22 million customers. The energy price gap is the maximum amount that suppliers can charge customers for each unit of gas and electricity they use. Prepayment customers will see an increase of \u00a3708 from \u00a31,309 to \u00a32,017. However, The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in its detailed predictions for the economy warned that the price cap is likely to rise by another 42 per cent in October \u2013 a 120 per cent increase on a year earlier. Resulting in skyrocketing costs hitting the nation, it could hike up household energy bills by another \u00a3830, with Brits having to fork out an annual sum of close to \u00a33,000. The forecaster also factored in the fallout from the ongoing Russian operation to demiltarise and de-Nazify Ukraine, after the Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for help in defending themselves against continued attacks from Kiev forces. In response to what has been labelled \u201can invasion\u201d, the US and its allies have slapped Moscow with massive sanctions. According to the OBR, inflation was anticipated to reach a 40-year high of 8.7 per cent next winter. It warned that higher inflation would invariably erode real incomes and consumption, slashing GDP growth in 2022 from 6.0 per cent in the October forecast to 3.8 per cent. The independent UK economic forecaster predicted that a racing inflation, \u201coutpacing\u201d nominal earnings, coupled with a net taxes rise in April, would set livings standards plummeting by 2.2 per cent in 2022-23. The watchdog summed up that it would be the largest financial year real living standards fall since records began in 1956. \u201cDespite the \u00a39billion in fiscal support for household energy bills delivered in the Spring Statement, pressure for more could build if the energy price cap in October does rise by the roughly 40 per cent assumed in our central forecast,\u201d concluded ORB. Indeed, the Spring Statement, delivered by UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday, contained an offering of measures by the British government to help people cope with the rising prices. But despite its tax cuts and additional benefits for low-income people, the mini-budget was criticized by some analysts and opposition lawmakers as falling short of what was needed under the circumstances. Sunak, in his speech, announced  that the government would slash 5p off the tax on a litre of gasoline and diesel for a year, promising it would save the average car driver about \u00a32 a week. Furthermore, another \u00a3500 million are to be added to the Household Support Fund, distributed by councils to help families on low incomes. Billed as the \u201clargest ever\u201d tax cut , another announcement was the increase in the income threshold that workers must meet before paying National Insurance. The broad tax funds state pensions and some benefits. The Chancellor scrapped a plan to increase the threshold by just \u00a3300, replacing it with a \u201cpersonal tax cut\u201d worth \u00a3330 to the average worker, he told MPs. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, this would compensate 70 percent of workers who will be hit by the 1.25 per cent hike in national insurance contributions (NICs) coming into effect next week. Rishi Sunak has also made an offer of zero-VAT rating for green home improvements, such as installation of solar panels and heat pumps, as part of a push to offset reliance on gas. Martin Lewis, who runs the Money Saving Expert website, was cited by The Independent as being frustrated with the Chancellor\u2019s \u201climited\u201d measure on energy. The OBR also stated that Rishi Sunak\u2019s Spring Statement measures did no more than remove one-sixth of the tax hikes previously announced, with the overall tax take set to reach its highest level since the 1940s. The watchdog added that after a \u00a36 billion cut in national insurance contributions (NICs,) coming into effect in July, and \u00a35 billion reduction in income tax in 2024, the overall tax take will rise from 33 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to 36.3 in 2026-27.

In the second segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Erica Caines, founder of Liberation Through Reading and Editor of Hood Communist Blog to discuss what the red-baiting that is pervasive in debates around critical race theory and what it misses about the reality of CRT, how the debate around CRT obfuscates the desire for Black community control of education, and the history of Black community control over education through small-scale alternative educational programs.

Moscow has reiterated that the aim of its special operation is to exclusively target military infrastructure, with the Kremlin having no plans to occupy Ukraine. However, in response to what has been labelled \u201can invasion\u201d, the US and its allies have been funneling military assistance to Ukraine and unleashing a sanctions campaign, fallout from which has already been felt by the West itself.

The EU imported $108 billion in energy from Russia in 2021, with these supplies accounting for about 62 percent of the region\u2019s total consumption.","content":"The Biden administration does not have the authority to force US energy producers to trade with European customers, and the EU\u2019s ambitious push to slash imports from Russia is not considered realistic, people who are said to be familiar with the situation have told Politico. Late last year, as spot prices for natural gas were soaring, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that US deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe had dropped, in spite of months of US \u201cconcerns\u201d about the price crunch being suffered by the region. Russia, Putin said, had increased its gas sales to Europe by 15 percent, and enjoys a competitive advantage against LNG in both pricing and carbon footprint. Russia delivered some 155 billion cubic meters of gas to Europe in 2021, with these supplies accounting for more than 45 percent of total European imports of the fuel. The region\u2019s reliance on Russian supplies has grown by over 25 percent over the past decade, notwithstanding a US-led effort to sabotage this trade using sanctions and diplomatic pressure to get European countries to buy more US-sourced LNG. Energy analysts cited by Politico said the two-thirds cut in Russian supplies recently proposed by Brussels \u201cisn\u2019t realistic\u201d, with a 50 to 60 percent reduction possible if a \u201cwartime effort\u201d were undertaken, with those efforts expected to affect the global LNG market with price shocks. An unnamed EU energy official said the bloc\u2019s requests would be \"tough to meet\". Another source called EU requests to date \"vague\", and suggested the EU remain wary of importing polluting US gas derived from fracking. Of America's LNG capacity, 80 percent is already slated for Europe, S&amp;P Global analyst Ross Wyeno said. No additional capacity is expected to be made available until at least 2024. The crisis in Ukraine has prompted America\u2019s European allies to pledge that they would dramatically reduce purchases of Russian energy, and Washington has instituted a total ban on oil and gas supplies from Russia earlier this month. \u201cWe\u2019re moving forward with this ban understanding that many of our European partners and allies may not be in a position to join us,\u201d President Biden said in a speech announcing the ban. The United States has not imported any Russian gas since 2019, and Russian oil accounted for only about one percent of total US consumption in 2021. The absence of Russian supplies has nevertheless had an apparent psychological impact on US energy prices, with gasoline hitting an all-time record of $4.33 per gallon on 11 March before dropping to $4.27 as of Friday. Biden is expected to bring up energy during his visit to Brussels on Thursday for a meeting of the European Council and to attend an emergency NATO summit. Russian officials and energy companies have announced readiness to continue supplying energy to Europe and other clients in accordance with existing contracts and said Moscow is prepared to reach new agreements. Supplies have continued to flow west, including through Ukraine, notwithstanding the ongoing Russian military operation in that country. Last month, Russia agreed a new 30-year 10 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas per year contract to supply gas to China using a new pipeline. The infrastructure expected to be built within two to three years. Russia already sells natural gas to China using both the Power of Siberia pipeline and LNG deliveries. The People\u2019s Republic purchased 16.5 billion bcm of Russian gas in 2021.

And now, you risk even worse branding by the thought police if you don\u2019t fall in line with this new outlook: That of a Putin-enabler.\u00a0\u00a0Since Russia launched its military campaign in Ukraine, Western elites have been arguing that we all must collectively and senselessly concede to lowering our basic standards of living in order to hit back at President Vladimir Putin. In reality, all it does is allow them to continue to profit from our increasingly lowered expectations while all we get in return is the satisfaction of our own virtue signaling.\u00a0French Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire called on all the French to \u201cmake an effort\u201d on their energy consumption to cope with the rising prices. People should \u201crealize that we\u2019re entering into a new world\u201d amid the conflict in Ukraine, in which we \u201cmust accelerate our independence vis-\u00e0-vis fossil fuel,\u201d he said in an interview with the news channel BFMTV earlier in March.\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, France\u2019s ecological transition minister, Barbara Pompili, announced that public institutions would be asked to \u201creduce by one degree\u201d their heating in response to the spike in energy prices since the onset of the conflict.\u00a0Le Maire let the cat out of the bag in evoking a \u201cnew world\u201d \u2013 a phrase which seems to be on the lips of top western officials these days, including US President Joe Biden earlier this week at a business round table. \u201cNow is a time when things are shifting and there\u2019s going to be a new world order out there, and we\u2019ve got to lead it,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.\u201dAnd chief EU diplomat Josep Borrell has also asked Europeans to \u201ccut the umbilical cord that connects with Russia,\u201d by using less heating, apparently unaware that it could potentially be redirected to other markets while Europeans sit around waiting for their newfound beaming virtue to generate heat.\u00a0There has long been American pressure on Europe to cut itself off from Russian gas. The hostility towards the needs of the average citizen living within the European Union has been framed as looking out for their best interests against Russia. The \u201cProtecting Europe\u2019s Energy Security Act of 2019\u201d was designed to sanction corporations involved in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline construction to \u201caddress Russian pipeline projects that create risks to U.S. national security, threaten Europe\u2019s energy security, and consequently, endanger Europe\u2019s political and economic welfare.\u201d\u00a0Not surprisingly, the legislation was introduced by Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from \u201cbig oil\u201d Texas, which could eventually profit from the EU losing Russia as its supplier. According to US government data, in 2021, the EU was buying about 2.3 million barrels a day of Russian crude oil and condensate \u2013 or 49 % of the country\u2019s exports.The problem is that there are no immediate practical substitutions for Russian energy. And while turning down \u201cPutin\u2019s gas\u201d in your French home may be appropriate in any case \u2013 and I speak as someone who has never once turned on the heat in my home in 13 years of French living \u2013 there\u2019s something else going on here. It seems like politicians are exploiting the current situation to condition people to accept paying more while accepting less value, and with no real end or practical solution in sight. The fact that Le Maire manipulatively played on emotions by evoking images of Ukrainian children in an appeal for basic energy conservation should raise red flags.Likewise, German Agriculture Minister Cem Ozdemir told Spiegel magazine that people should fight Putin by changing their diet. \u201cDespite the fact that I am a vegetarian, I will not preach that everyone should go vegetarian,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s put it this way: Eating less meat would be a contribution against Putin.\u201dThis message is brought to us by the same elites who routinely peddle the idea of westerners eating bugs in mainstream media. Ozedemir\u2019s request has nothing to do with Putin or Ukraine and everything to do with this obsession of relentlessly guilting the average person into complying with, and pressuring one another into, lowering their own living standards under the pretext of fighting climate change, or Putin, or whatever other cockamamie excuse they think you\u2019ll accept.Meanwhile, Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder, climate change fighter, and relentless vaccine peddler, has become the largest private farmland owner in the United States and is set up to be one of the big beneficiaries of a meatless future. Particularly when considering that Gates has openly supported genetically modified food production, while the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has invested millions into the genetically modified food company, Monsanto, according to NBC News. Other Silicon Valley billionaires are also investing in fake food production, including PayPal founder Peter Thiel and Google co-founder Sergey Brin.This makes one wonder if it\u2019s really about sticking it to Putin and not about the wealthy trying to convince you to advocate against your own best interests.\u00a0Not even your sacred pets are safe. A Bloomberg News opinion piece suggested recently that people should cut corners on the health of their companion animals in this period of crisis-provoked inflation. \u201cIf you\u2019re one of the many Americans who became a new pet owner during the pandemic, you might want to rethink those costly pet medical needs,\u201d the piece stated.Another op-ed in France\u2019s Liberation newspaper asks: \u201cHow far are we prepared to go in economic sanctions against Russia and what they mean in our daily lives?\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s impossible to escape the constant undertone of the need to sacrifice for the greater global good or else be viewed as a selfish prick. And now, you risk even worse branding by the thought police if you don\u2019t fall in line with this new outlook: That of a Putin-enabler.\u00a0At this rate, we\u2019ll soon be at the point where if you aren\u2019t living at the same standard as a Ukrainian refugee, then you\u2019re an earth-killing, gas-guzzling, democracy-hating glutton who has no business participating in polite society. If you think that it can\u2019t happen, just ask any of those who were shunned and marginalized without pity, losing their jobs, lifestyle, or freedom of travel amid the Covid crisis when they refused to get vaccinated in order to obtain the coveted digital health pass.Western elites are exploiting this crisis to accelerate a long articulated agenda that seems destined to lead to collective impoverishment to the benefit of a select few. They point and scream at Russia, advancing their pawns and scapegoats from behind fake virtue.

But Britain is hooked up to other European countries that do receive Russian gas supplies, including the Netherlands \u2014 which exports more than it uses.","content":"A British government minister has claimed the UK imports only three per cent of its natural gas needs from Russia \u2014 and that none comes via undersea pipelines. Responding to written parliamentary questions, Business, Energy and Clean Growth Minister Greg Hands said the average annual gas consumption of a British household was roughly 12,200 kilowatt hours (kWh). He added that the UK had imported about 21,506 Gigawatt hours of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) from Russia over the past five years. The MailOnline calculated that meant Russia heats around 1.75 million of Britain's 28 million homes, or 4.2 million people. As part of sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, the British government has vowed to ban Russian oil purchases from 2023 and \"explore\" phasing out gas imports too. Russia has responded by requiring all European Union and NATO member states to pay for its gas in roubles, undermining the value of Western currencies. Hands insisted that \"The UK only receives direct gas in the form of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) from Russia, since there are no gas pipelines directly linking the UK with Russia.\" However, the UK's gas network is connected to those of other western European countries including Germany, France and the Netherlands, all of which import gas from Russia. According to number-crunching website Statista, the Netherlands imported 11 per cent of its 36.6 billion cubic metre (m3) gas consumption from Russia in 2020 \u2014 but at the same time exported 39.9 billion m3. In 2018 the Netherlands pumped just over 30 gigawatt-hours of gas to the UK, equating to 2.64 billion m3. \"Over the last five years (2017-2021), UK gas imports from Russia accounted for, on average, two per cent of the UK\u2019s gas supply portfolio,\" the minister said. \"On average, over the last five years (2017-2021), the UK received 21506 GWh of LNG from Russia.\" Britain reportedly gets around half its gas from its North Sea fields and another third from nearby Norway.  The UK is also home to Europe's largest LNG terminal, the South Hook installation in Milford Haven in south-west Wales. Qatar Energy has a 67.5 per cent majority shareholding in the facility, with ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies having 24.15 per cent and 8.35 Per cent respectively. South Hook and the nearby Dragon terminal can potentially handle a quarter of UK gas consumption.   Qatar, one of the world's biggest exporters of natural gas from its Persian Gulf fields, has said it cannot replace Europe's Russian gas imports in the short term.

The Kremlin spokesman reiterated that the Russian military does not strike civilian targets, and the purpose of the special military operation is not the \"occupation of Ukraine.\" Peskov added that the special military operation in Ukraine is going exactly according to plan, noting that no one at the Kremlin initially thought that the special military operation would take a couple of days, as this is what was described as a serious operation with serious goals. Peskov also refuted claims that Russian President Vladimir Putin is angry with Ukrainians. He noted, however, that Putin is angry with people in Ukraine who want their country to become a NATO member and potentially deploy American missiles. Peskov also suggested that the Russian president is angry with those who would forbid the use of the Russian language, and who wanted to participate in the Minsk negotiation process for years without fulfilling obligations. Peskov was responding to a CNN journalist saying that some experts believe that Putin may be angry with Ukrainians. She also cited Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, who, she suggested, spoke of Putin's \"growing hatred\" for Ukrainian leadership and the nation\u2019s citizens. Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine on February 24. Putin at the time said its goal was \"the protection of people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years.\" The Russian president additionally asserted that a demilitarization and \"denazification\" of Ukraine must be performed to bring to justice war criminals responsible for \"bloody crimes against civilians\" in Donbass. Later, the Russian Ministry of Defense added that the army is only targetting military infrastructure and Ukrainian troops, along with neo-Nazi militias. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

According to the newspaper, users on Facebook are competing against each other, bragging about the size of their houses, bedrooms, as well as leisure facilities located nearby. Another family offered \"two double bedrooms and a large private bathroom\u201d as well as \"a room with a king-size bed\" in a house \"next to the beach\".Ukrainian refugees are said to have received 300 posts each with Brits offering them to stay in their houses. The Telegraph writes that 147,000 people have registered for the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Sources told the newspaper that this amounted to more than 400,000 rooms. A couple who spoke to the outlet said they had to abandon their plans to offer accommodation to Ukrainians in the face of intense competition. The couple\u2019s frustration has been echoed by charity organisations, which said that the authorities must immediately take charge of the process instead of leaving it to the public.\"With multiple Facebook sites now available, there is a risk of the process getting out of control and becoming a free-for-all. It\u2019s vital the Government now steps in and has oversight of the matching process\", said Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council.Robina Qureshi, the director of Positive Action in Housing which runs Room for Refugees, said the government\u2019s system is an \"inadequate replacement for a safe, screened, risk-assessed hosting process\". Lord Richard Harrington, UK minister for refugees, said the first Ukrainians under the government scheme would start arriving in Britain early next week. He said the government has no idea how many people would enter the country.Under the programme, residents of Britain have to offer accommodation for at least six months. The government will provide \"a substantial level of funding to local authorities to enable them to provide much wider support to families to rebuild their lives and fully integrate into our communities\". Under this scheme, people will have access to public services, work, and benefits.Authorities are offering an optional \"thank you\" payment of \u00a3350 per month to people who can accommodate one or more household. It is limited to one payment per residential address. Since 24 February, Russia has been conducting a special operation in Ukraine, which President Vladimir Putin said is meant to de-Nazify and demilitarise Kiev as well as protect the residents of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics from the genocide waged against them by Ukraine's leadership. Western nations have thrown their support behind Ukraine and condemned Russia's actions, also slapping the harshest sanctions on Moscow to date, triggering an unprecedented stand-off with the Kremlin.According to the United Nations, more than 3.2 million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the operation.

A growing number are considering breaking ties with the monarchy altogether, as fellow Caribbean island nation Barbados did last year, and sources tell UK media the process of separation may be underway already.The island nation is already in the process of removing the Queen as head of state, according to sources cited by The Independent, which claimed a \u201csenior figure within the government\u201d had been tasked with transitioning Jamaica to a republic.Hundreds of protesters gathered to meet the royal couple outside the British High Commission building on Tuesday, and an open letter from a coalition of Jamaican politicians, business leaders, musicians, and other professionals calling itself the Advocates Network was handed over to the High Commission as well. The missive listed 60 reasons why the British monarchy should compensate Jamaica to celebrate its 60 years of independence, and reparations were front and center.The\u00a0group\u00a0aren\u2019t just seeking money\u00a0\u2013 they want \u201ceconomic social reparation,\u201d like \u201cbuilding us proper hospitals, providing and making sure that our children are educated through college level, and making sure land is equally distributed,\u201d human rights advocate Opal Adisa, a signatory to the letter, said, adding that an apology would be merely the \u201cfirst step towards healing and reconciliation.\u201dHowever, the Advocates Network have clearly had enough of waiting.\u201cWe see no reason to celebrate 70 years of the ascension of your grandmother to the British throne because her leadership, and that of her predecessors, have perpetuated the greatest human rights tragedy in the history of humankind,\u201d the letter reads, calling for \u201can apology for British crimes against humanity, including but not limited to, the exploitation of the indigenous people of Jamaica, the transatlantic trafficking of Africans, the enslavement of Africans, indentureship and colonisation.\u201dCulture Minister Olivia \u2018Babsy\u2019 Grange\u00a0addressed members of the Reparations Council on Saturday, calling for them to \u201cstep up the pace\u201d on developing a \u201croadmap to reparation.\u201d Even the opposition party reportedly agrees that the monarchy should atone for the horrors of slavery, though not everyone is on board with the idea of \u2018divorcing\u2019 from the monarchy.Jamaica became a British colony in 1665, and over 3 million African slaves were trafficked through the transatlantic network of which the island was a major hub before slavery was abolished in the colony in 1838.While Britain finally paid off the descendants of slave owners\u00a0for the loss of \u2018property\u2019 they endured when their slaves became free human beings in 2015, paying reparations to the descendants of their former property has proved less popular.Former PM David Cameron, whose family profited from the slave trade, was asked for reparations in 2015 when he became the first British PM to visit Jamaica in 14 years, but he rejected the idea.The royal tour, set to coincide with the Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee marking 70 years on the throne, has been repeatedly described by the UK press as a \u201ccharm offensive,\u201d with some experts suggesting it is an attempt to prevent a \u201cdomino effect\u201d following last year\u2019s departure of Barbados from the British Commonwealth.Thus far it seems to have proven more \u201coffensive\u201d than \u201ccharming,\u201d with the royal couple chased off their first appointment during their visit to Belize, after protesters objected to their attempted use of \u201cstolen\u201d communal land.

On Friday, US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a nearly two-hour video meeting to discuss the conflict, as well as their bilateral relations.\u00a0\u00a0The talks do not appear to have produced a substantive change in the position of either side, with the White House readout of the call evidencing that the US is continuing to allude to taking action against China but also, unusually, that Biden referenced Taiwan. The US president warned Beijing that there would be \u201cimplications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia.\u201d\u00a0In response, President Xi said China has always stood for \u201cpeace, and opposes war.\u201d \u201cAll sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace,\u201d he stressed, adding that NATO and the US should also engage in talks with Moscow.\u00a0This was the first known discussion between the American and Chinese leaders since November. It followed a meeting at the beginning of the week in Rome between US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and China\u2019s leading diplomat, Yang Jiechi.\u00a0The US has made it clear that it will impose \u201ccosts\u201d on Beijing if it is deemed to be \u201csupporting\u201d Russia. Earlier this week, several Western media outlets claimed Moscow had asked Beijing \u201cfor equipment and other kinds of unspecified military assistance\u201d to aid its offensive in Ukraine. Beijing has dismissed the allegations, with the spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, saying of Russia\u2019s alleged request that China \u201chad never heard of that,\u201d and adding that his country\u2019s priority was \u201cto prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control.\u201d It\u2019s likely the allegation was designed to both embarrass Beijing and further promulgate the narrative that Russia\u2019s war effort is failing.China is a cautious geopolitical player. It has a foreign policy premised on seeking stability and prioritizing its own economic development. Because of that, it does not and will not openly support the war in Ukraine. However, these concerns don\u2019t mean Xi Jinping is going to jump into America\u2019s arms and confront Moscow.\u00a0While China undoubtedly wishes for a peaceful resolution, it owes the United States nothing, and it recognizes that turning against Russia would involve exchanging long-term strategic considerations for short-term certainties. After all, once the crisis in Ukraine is over, it will be full steam ahead for the US\u2019 Indo-Pacific strategy and business as usual when it comes to its containment of Beijing.Last month, just before the opening of the Winter Olympics, Vladimir Putin met with Xi Jinping and sealed a \u201cno limits\u201d friendship between their two countries, affirming a joint vision for a multipolar world. The Russia-China partnership has strengthened considerably in recent years, each nation having faced the common strategic enmity of the US and its allies, with Washington long seeking to contain both in the pursuit of unipolar hegemony and to crush all of its competitors along the way.\u00a0Moscow and Beijing have differing interests in a number of respective areas, but a consensus forged on the premise that they provide each other political space and act as a counterweight to the US and its alliances, being invested in a multipolar environment.Although Russia\u2019s offensive in Ukraine has distracted Washington from its Indo-Pacific agenda, it has also provoked uncertainty in the markets, allowed the US to increase its clout in the EU, and encouraged Taiwan to exploit the crisis so as to build more political space for itself. China also had a strong trading relationship with Ukraine, which joined its Belt and Road Initiative back in 2017.\u00a0It\u2019s clear the US is seeking to use the crisis to drive a wedge between Beijing and its allies, and, in its bid to isolate both Russia and China, is aiming to frame Beijing as being complicit in Moscow\u2019s \u201cspecial operation.\u201d It will no doubt reset its strategic priorities as the war continues. However, for a number of reasons, this is unlikely to change China\u2019s calculus.First, even if Beijing were to explicitly act against Moscow, the US would not change its current course on China as a reward. Beijing therefore has no reason either to trust or barter with Washington. It should not be forgotten that, prior to the Ukraine conflict, the US was effectively accusing China of genocide against the Uighurs, had orchestrated a smear campaign against the Winter Olympics, had blacklisted ever-growing numbers of its companies, had created hostile military blocs such as AUKUS (Australia, the UK, and the US), the Quad (Australia, India, Japan, and the US), and was trying to move the needle on Taiwan. One would be na\u00efve to assume Washington would reverse course on any of this in the vain hope Beijing would turn against Moscow and dump its key strategic partner just to appease the US and its allies.Second, China recognizes that the US views it as its primary threat and competitor, perceiving Russia as having less capacity to compete on a global scale in terms of economics and technology. While Beijing may continue to call for peace and dialogue in Ukraine, it will nonetheless continue to align itself with Moscow when it comes to opposing the expansion of NATO, calling instead for a \u201cbalanced, effective, and sustainable security mechanism.\u201d This is in line with its existing position on the creation of US-led alliance blocs targeting nations such as China, and the Cold War mentality that has been evoked as a consequence. China has made no secret of its view that the US is \u201con the wrong side of history.\u201dIn conclusion, while China doesn\u2019t like the uncertainty of the conflict in Ukraine, it owes the US no favors when it comes to the part it will play in restoring stability. Having been intent on waging a Cold War against Beijing, Washington is now attempting to control its response to the Ukrainian crisis while continuing to alternately threaten and coerce it. As a result, when it comes to its strategic partnership with Russia, it has simply dug in its heels.\u00a0While China and Russia don\u2019t share the same world view, they\u2019ve been brought together by the political currents of the West, which arrogantly believes it can impose its dominance and expand its spheres of influence without consequences. Though China will engage in dialogue with the US, there\u2019s going to be no 21st-century repeat of the Sino-Soviet split, whatever the US might have hoped.\u00a0"},{"uuid":"f225fd10-4363-4e8c-9293-94e061c9bc86","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220320\/finnish-president-says-joining-nato-can-escalate-security-situation-in-europe-1094029141.html","title":"Finnish President Says There is 'Major Escalation Risk' in Europe as Country Debates NATO Membership","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/107039\/45\/1070394553_0:0:3450:2412_1440x900_80_0_1_b074b5b60a10edc0c4cb169b48b04d5a.jpg?source-sid=reuters_photo","subtitle":"MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Finland is looking into ways of enhancing its security amid events in Ukraine but realizes that the option of joining NATO is linked to a risk of escalation in Europe, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said on Sunday.","content":"Finland now is a member of the European Union but not NATO.

The decision means that money from the FCC's $8 billion annual Universal Service Fund (USF) can no longer be used to buy or maintain items from any of the listed corporations, according to the designation. Funds from the USF are, in part, used to help low-income consumers access telecommunication services in rural and high-cost locations, as well as government facilities such as schools, libraries, and healthcare facilities.  FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr welcomed the move, saying that the agency \"plays a critical role in securing our nation\u2019s communications networks, and keeping our Covered List up to date is an important tool we have at our disposal to do just that\". Moscow-based Kaspersky Labs has been under increasing pressure due to the crippling sanctions imposed by many nations across the globe, including in the West, on Russian entities because of the nation's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine.  US officials have long voiced concerns about Kaspersky, Russia's biggest information company. The company's flagship anti-virus programme was banned from federal networks in 2017. European cyber agencies have begun to follow suit, releasing similar cautionary statements and restrictions, according to reports. The FCC voted 4-0 earlier this month to withdraw the authorisation for Chinese telecom Pacific Networks and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ComNet, to provide telecommunications services in the United States. The FCC terminated China Telecom (Americas)'s authorisation in October 2021, claiming the company \"is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government\", and the firm reportedly failed to get the ruling overturned in court.   The agency went on to reject China Mobile's application to install telecommunications services in the United States in 2019, citing national security concerns. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

According to Heikki Porola, chief superintendent at the Helsinki Police Department, the threats began immediately after the launch of Russia's military operation to demilitarise Ukraine, which the West depicts as \u201coccupation\u201d. So far, the threats, delivered via letters and other media, have not resulted in any incidents and no explosives have been found. The police are working with the embassy, located in central Helsinki, to determine whether the threats are credible, but have yet to launch a criminal investigation, national broadcaster Yle reported. However, in recent weeks the embassy has also been the target of vandalism as perpetrators have sprayed graffiti on the fence around the building and broke a security camera attached to one of the gates. Since then, surveillance at the location has been stepped up, with round-the-clock patrols in the area. These incidents have coincided with large-scale demonstrations outside the embassy, according to police. According the police, embassies, especially those belonging to countries seen as superpowers, often receive threats when significant international events occur. The last time the Russian Embassy in Finland was threatened when during Crimea's re-unification with Russia in 2014, which the West largely portrayed as an \u201cinvasion\u201d. Following Russia's demilitarisation campaign in Ukraine, anti-Russian sentiment has soared across the Western world, reaching levels unseen since the Cold War era, with numerous reported instances of people getting abused, \u201ccancelled\u201d, discriminated against or persecuted for having Russian roots or sympathies. Among others, the University of Helsinki, one of Finland's premier higher education establishments, was this week bombarded with thousands of anti-Russia comments on its social media channels. The messages urged the university to stop accepting students from Russia and terminate scholarships for Russian citizens. The university has previously stated that it will continue to welcome researchers and students from Russia, yet condemned Russia's special operation. Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, in response to calls for help from the People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk amid shelling by Ukrainian forces.

Yeah, it was a brilliant way to finish,\" Barty added.According to Barty's coach Craig Tyzzer, Barty had asked if she could retire following her 2019 victory at the French Open, which means her bombshell announcement this week didn't surprise him.\"After (winning) Wimbledon that was an obvious goal for us and once she achieved it and once we got to the Olympics, it sort of hit home for me that there wasn't much left in her,\" Tyzzer said.\"The motivation wasn't there, except when she played doubles with Storm [Sanders] and mixed with John Peers, her singles really went by the wayside.\"She wasn't fussed. So I felt that she had climbed where she needed to get to and it was going to be a hard slog to keep her involved,\" Tyzzer admitted."},{"uuid":"f284110a-e55b-49b9-a915-784cbbc2929b","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552590-nato-sending-battlegroups-eastern-europe\/","title":"NATO set for new troop deployment on \u2018eastern flank\u2019","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623c185520302744095ecff5.jpg","subtitle":"The military bloc said four new battlegroups will be stationed across Eastern Europe","content":"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said thousands of troops will soon be deployed to four countries in Eastern Europe, calling for the alliance to be bolstered \u201cin all domains,\u201d as it oversees around 140,000 soldiers on the continent.Speaking ahead of a NATO summit set for later this week, Stoltenberg told reporters on Wednesday that he expects member states to agree to \u201cstrengthen NATO\u2019s posture in all domains,\u201d including \u201cmajor increases to our forces in the eastern part of the alliance on land, in the air and at sea.\u201d\u201cThe first step is the deployment of four new NATO battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia,\u201d he continued. \u201cAlong with our existing forces in the Baltic countries and Poland, this means we will have eight multinational NATO battlegroups all along the eastern flank, from the Baltic to the Black Sea.\u201dA battlegroup is made up of between 1,000 and 1,500 soldiers and usually includes both tank and infantry units.In total, Stoltenberg said there are now \u201chundreds of thousands of allied troops at heightened readiness across the alliance,\u201d among them 100,000 American soldiers stationed in Europe and another 40,000 under direct NATO command, who will remain \u201cas long as necessary.\u201d Five carrier strike groups \u2013 a naval formation typically consisting of an aircraft carrier and a number of destroyers, frigates, and other support vessels \u2013 have also been deployed around the region, he added.Military officials cited by the Associated Press estimated that the number of troops under the alliance\u2019s command is \u201calmost tenfold higher\u201d than it was just a few months ago, highlighting the significant Western reaction to Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine in late February.Pointing to ongoing fighting in the country, Stoltenberg said the military bloc faces a \u201cpivotal moment for [its] security,\u201d arguing that Moscow\u2019s actions have created a \u201cnew normal\u201d and that \u201cNATO has to respond to that new reality.\u201d\u00a0Though the 30-nation alliance has declined to send troops into Ukraine or back a no-fly zone over the country, individual member states have approved a flurry of arms shipments and other \u201clethal aid\u201d to Kiev, sending thousands of shoulder-fired anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles in recent weeks.\u00a0At the NATO summit planned for Thursday, members are also expected to pressure China to take a firm stance against Russia, with Stoltenberg accusing Beijing of providing \u201cpolitical support\u201d to Moscow since it launched its attack."},{"uuid":"f2924af0-99a6-4f54-837b-7355c28f3644","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220325\/chinese-embassy-in-eu-slams-natos-outdated-security-concept-for-dragging-world-to-cold-war-1094202775.html","title":"Chinese Embassy in EU Slams NATO's 'Outdated Security Concept' for Dragging World Into Cold War","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/07e6\/03\/19\/1094203679_0:0:2429:1683_1440x900_80_0_1_c08a5cc666423df83652833c33faa251.jpg?source-sid=reuters_photo","subtitle":"On Thursday, NATO urged Beijing to \"abstain from supporting Russia's war effort in any way\", accusing President Xi Jinping's government of taking Moscow's side in the latter's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, and telling China to \"refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions\".","content":"The Chinese Embassy in the EU on Friday stated that what it said was NATO's expansion strategy is dragging the planet toward a new Cold War. According to the diplomatic statement, an embassy spokesperson said that the language was intended to \"fan the flames to stir up trouble\". Instead, the government of Chinese President Xi Jinping claimed that it is \"firmly opposed\" to NATO's \"groundless accusations and suspicions, as well as any attempts to exert coercion and pressure against China\". The spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy also pointed out that following the eruption of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, Beijing has been \"working actively and constructively\" to assist peace talks, conflict resolution, and the avoidance of a large-scale humanitarian crisis in an objective and unbiased manner. \"Time will prove that China is on the right side of history\", the spokesperson asserted. Meanwhile, according to the embassy, as a Cold War \"remnant and the world's largest military alliance, NATO follows an outdated security concept\". The Chinese Embassy spokesperson also noted that on 24 March 1999, NATO bombed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, \"causing thousands of casualties\", including some Chinese citizens, and displacing hundreds of thousands. \"The lessons of history must not be forgotten\", the mission said. On Thursday, NATO condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine as a \"threat\" to global security, with the Kremlin calling it \"escalatory rhetoric [...] irresponsible and destabilising\". NATO has called on \"all states\", including China, to \"uphold the international order including the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity\", and refrain from supporting Russia in any way, and to refrain from taking any action that aids Moscow in evading sanctions. NATO also said that the Xi administration's public statements have \"alarmed\" the bloc, while urging Beijing not to support what it said were Russia's \"false narratives...in particular on the war and on NATO\". China has consistently replied to accusations from the West that it is supporting the Russian government by respecting international law and Ukraine's sovereignty, but adding that the security concerns that Russia claimed sparked the crisis must not be overlooked. The statement from the embassy reaffirmed that position, as well as Beijing's demand for a ceasefire and an end to the special military operation. In February, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the goal of the special military operation in Ukraine \"the protection of people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years\". According to Putin, a \"demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine\" must be carried out so as to bring to justice war criminals responsible for the \"bloody crimes against civilians\" in Donbass.

The plants were originally supposed to be phased out by 2025 under a plan proposed nearly two decades ago.\u201cEveryone knows there is a war in Europe\u2026 we choose certainty in uncertain times,\u201d PM Alexander De Croo told a press conference on Friday, alluding to the Russian origin of most of Europe\u2019s natural gas supplies. After Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine, the EU announced plans to cut dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year, with a view to ending its reliance on the fuel entirely by 2030.Under the original plan, proposed in 2003, Belgium was supposed to build a gas-powered plant north of Brussels and shut down its French-operated nuclear reactors Doel 4 and Tihange 3 by 2025. The lifespan of the two reactors, which came online in 1985, \u201ccan be extended by 10 years,\u201d De Croo announced in his address.The PM also declared the country would speed up its transition to renewable energy, though he did not specify what kind of energy. Tihange and Doel, which together comprise 35% of the country\u2019s nuclear energy capacity, are located in eastern Belgium and the Antwerp area and generate 1,038 and 1,039 megawatts, respectively.Last year, Belgium\u2019s government confirmed it would shut down all the country\u2019s nuclear plants over the subsequent three years. However, at the time, the country planned to investigate other forms of nuclear energy with an eye toward possibly opening smaller nuclear plants.Specifically, the government was interested in smaller modular reactors which, while generating less power than their larger brethren, are also less likely to cause catastrophic meltdowns, with any potential failures being easier to contain.Belgium\u2019s two nuclear plants contain a total of seven reactors, all operated by French utility firm Engie. While neighboring France considers nuclear power to be \u201cgreen\u201d and derives 70% of its energy from nuclear plants, fellow neighbor Germany does not and initially planned to shut down all its nuclear plants by the end of 2022 under a deal inked in the aftermath of Japan\u2019s Fukushima disaster.However, as the EU squirms between the need for imported natural gas and the perceived necessity of punishing Moscow with sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, Berlin is reconsidering shutting down its nuclear plants. Three such plants remain in operation, with the country\u2019s economic ministers having called for a reconsideration of the shutdown plans. But the phaseout has progressed to such an extent that, even if the government opts to keep the nuclear plants operational, it will require another 18 months before they can return to functionality, with a shortage of trained personnel and a difficulty in obtaining the necessary fuel rods meaning the plants must shut down at least temporarily until the winter of 2023-2024. The fate of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was supposed to carry Russian natural gas directly to Germany, remains unknown, but it is unlikely to become operational under the current array of sanctions."},{"uuid":"f3a18ef9-b48e-4106-a2e1-dea3b4f1e34d","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552525-poland-expel-45-russian-diplomats\/","title":"Poland to expel 45 Russian diplomats","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/623ae9f685f54047bb542dd9.jpg","subtitle":"The country\u2019s domestic security agency accused them of being spies","content":"Poland will expel 45 Russian diplomats who are suspected of working as spies, the Internal Security Agency announced on Wednesday.The suspected individuals were described as \u201cofficers of the Russian special services and persons associated with them\u201d enjoying diplomatic status in Poland.

On Friday, Biden headed to Poland, the final destination of his European tour, after taking part in an extraordinary NATO summit over Russia's military operation in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters during his meeting with the Ukrainian refugees on Saturday, Biden called Putin \"a butcher\". Volodin's sentiment was echoed by another State Duma member, Leonid Slutsky, who is also a member of the Russian delegation in the negotiations between Kiev and Moscow amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Biden earlier slammed Putin as \"a war criminal\" when speaking about the ongoing military operation in Ukraine launched by the Kremlin. This remark also received criticism from Russia, with Russian Ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov saying that such statements \"go beyond common sense\". The Kremlin called the \"war criminal\" remarks unacceptable, especially when coming from the leader of a country with a history of killing hundreds of thousands around the world. According to Moscow, the goal of the Russian military operation in Ukraine is to \"demilitarise and de-Nazify\" the country, with the Russian troops exclusively targeting military infrastructure and posing no threat to civilians.  Western countries have condemned the military operation, with the United States being among the most vocal critics. They have called Moscow's actions in Ukraine an invasion and imposed harsh sanctions targeting the Russian economy, financial sector, culture, sports, media outlets and many other things.

The arrangement would allow India and Russia to carry out financial operations bypassing the US dollar. Russia is effectively blocked from using US currency due to Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine.According to the official, the Indian government is working on a proposal to allow up to five nationalized Indian banks to be engaged in the rupee-ruble trade mechanism, and discussions between the central bank governor, the finance minister, and the banks on the matter have already been held. The arrangement would let Indian exporters continue doing business with Russia despite sanctions banning, among other things, international payment mechanisms in the country, such as SWIFT. It would also let India continue buying Russian energy exports and other goods.According to Sakthivel, the Indian economy could profit from sanctions Russia is facing, as they give Indian exporters an opportunity to expand on the Russian market.\u201cExport to Russia is not much, only in agriculture and pharmacy products. Now that the whole of the West is banning Russia, there will be a lot of opportunities for Indian firms to enter Russia,\u201d he stated.India\u2019s finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India have not yet commented on the new trade arrangement.Unlike the US and the EU, India has not criticized Russia over its military operation in Ukraine, and has abstained from condemning Moscow during the recent UN voting rounds. When asked whether India\u2019s continued commerce with Russia would draw Western ire, Sakthivel said his country had taken a \u201cneutral stand\u201d on the situation in Ukraine.\u201cThe government will take into account all the factors. The government is playing it very carefully,\u201d he stressed.India exported $3.3 billion worth of goods to Russia in 2021, mostly pharmaceutical products, tea, and coffee. In terms of imports, India bought $6.9 billion worth of Russian products, including arms and defense goods, mineral resources, fertilizers, metals, diamonds and other precious stones.

Among other measures, it would introduce a prison sentence of up to four years for anyone entering the country without the correct immigration documents. It would also make it impossible for an illegal immigrant to immediately apply for asylum.According to The Guardian, citing a Home Office briefing note for MPs, ministers won\u2019t\u00a0compromise on these measures and plan to block the Lords\u2019 amendments aimed at softening the bill.As the number of Ukrainian refugees fleeing their country amid war with Russia grows, and is now being counted in the millions, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called on Conservative parliamentarians to put pressure on the government to make it agree to amend the bill.\u201cIt is unbelievable and deeply shameful that at a time like this [Home Secretary] Priti Patel is still pushing ahead with plans that could criminalise desperate Ukrainians who arrived in the UK with the wrong papers and mean vulnerable refugees who have fled war or persecution could end up with prison sentences,\u201d Cooper said.The government apparently does not agree with this logic, however: the Home Office source quoted by The Guardian said the bill\u2019s purpose was to crack down on people-smuggling and would thus help free up more resources for refugees such as those from Ukraine. The home secretary is known for her tough stance when it comes to illegal immigration. The numbers of migrants trying to cross the English Channel have dramatically increased in recent years, and Patel has pledged to fix \u201cthe broken asylum system\u201d and \u201creduce the incentives\u201d for those illegally entering the UK, thus \u201cremoving the opportunity for criminal gangs to profit.\u201dOn Monday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the UK had already issued 9,500 visas to Ukrainians with family connections in the country, and that 150,000 people had signed up to host refugees through the Homes for Ukraine program. In total, he said he expected \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Ukrainians to arrive imminently in Britain.However, charity organizations apparently do not share Javid\u2019s optimism, saying UK visa applications are long and difficult to complete, especially for people\u00a0 under duress, and therefore might become a serious obstacle for refugees.Though the UK says measures are being taken to simplify the process, a visa waiver for Ukrainians is apparently not being considered. Javid made it clear that \u201csome level of security checks\u201d on all asylum seekers was necessary.According to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, some 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country since February 24, when Russia launched its \u201cspecial military operation.\u201dMoscow attacked Ukraine in late February, following a seven-year standoff over what it said was\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. German- and French-brokered protocols had been designed to regularize the status of those regions within the Ukrainian state.Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the US-led NATO military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims that it had been planning to retake the two republics by force."},{"uuid":"f61a9a25-b8de-428c-bdcf-95dadcc86b70","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/552262-us-china-biden-xi\/","title":"US should have dialogue with Russia and address \u2018crux\u2019 of Ukrainian crisis, China\u2019s Xi tells Biden","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6234ee7285f54048ee2f8bab.jpg","subtitle":"The presidents of the two countries have held talks to discuss the most pressing international and bilateral issues","content":"China\u2019s President Xi Jinping urged his US counterpart, Joe Biden, to engage in talks with Russia to address the reasons for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, stressing it should be resolved through diplomacy.The two presidents spoke via a video link on Friday and discussed various international and bilateral issues.

Beijing considers the island an integral part of its territory, yet it has not governed Taiwan for decades, as it became the last stronghold of nationalist forces during the Chinese civil war.At the same time, Taiwan has enjoyed a cozy relationship with the US, particularly in military cooperation, which Beijing regards as a breach of its One China policy, which America recognizes. China has repeatedly accused Washington of meddling in its internal affairs and of fueling \u201cseparatist\u201d sentiments on the island. Both the US and China have repeatedly flexed their military muscle near Taiwan, with Beijing frequently staging massive drills nearby and sending in large air and naval forces into areas claimed by Taiwan as its sovereign territory."},{"uuid":"f6f9068e-12fb-46b8-959e-36b9df53ccf1","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/sport\/552841-ufc-petr-yan-usa-arrival\/","title":"Russian UFC destroyer fires warning after touching down in US","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6241b52f85f5402152341be2.jpg","subtitle":"Petr Yan says he intends to \u2018do his job\u2019 against rival Aljamain Sterling next month","content":"Russian superstar Petr Yan has set foot on US soil ahead of his high-stakes rematch with title rival Aljamain Sterling, and has vowed to reclaim the throne when the warring foes step into the cage at UFC 273 next month.Yan, the former undisputed UFC bantamweight champion, lost his title to Sterling in hugely controversial circumstances last year when he was disqualified for landing a clearly illegal knee strike to Sterling.The American fighter was dazed by the shot which occurred in a fight in which he was\u00a0behind on the scorecards\u00a0and was subsequently declared unable to continue by cageside doctors, winning the bout \u2013\u00a0and the world title\u00a0\u2013 by disqualification.Yan, though, has repeatedly maintained in the months which followed that he believes that Sterling was \u2018faking\u2019 the injury and that he could have continued the fight if he wanted to, but suggested instead that he took the easy way out.Yan's frustration was compounded by Sterling, who had initially left the belt in the cage after the fight in a signal that he was unhappy with the fight's climax, quickly changing his tune and declaring himself the undisputed world champion in spite of the bout's controversial conclusion.But ahead of their rematch which will finally take place at UFC 273 on April 9, Yan has fired a warning shot to his opponent after touching down in America.\u201cI'm on the spot! April 9, I will prove that I am the best in the world!\u201d\u00a0the 29-year-old said alongside an image of him at a Miami airport.\u201cJust landed in USA, Aljo\u2019s prayers wasn\u2019t answered,\u201d he added on Twitter.Just landed in USA, Alja\u2019s prayers wasn\u2019t answered \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffcYan's comments come after several members of his corner team were reportedly struggling to obtain visas to enter the United States, meaning that the Russian fighter would have to hastily assemble a new staff to put him through his paces between now and fight night, as well as in-between rounds at UFC 273.Russia's ongoing military operation in Ukraine has led to visa applications for some Russian citizens to be rejected. Yan is understood to possess a multi-year US visa and his entry into the country was unaffected.\u00a0Yan has joked about the matter on social media, asking the likes of rising UFC star Sean O'Malley and even Khabib Nurmagomedov to corner him for the fight.A member of Yan's team has recently said that he will at least have the services of\u00a0manager Sayat Abdrakhmanov and veteran trainer Alexei Sorokin in his corner. But whoever ends up walking him to the cage in Jacksonville, Florida next month, Yan says that the Sterling rematch will be a mere formality.\u201cMy long training camp has come to an end, thank you to all the people who were close to me.

Russia has repeatedly condemned tactics used by the Ukrainian military and nationalist battalions to deploy their artillery and MLRS units in areas densely populated by civilians. Moscow has alleged that this is done to provoke Russian forces into attacking civilian objects and then blame the casualties on Moscow. The Russian Defence Ministry has stressed on several occasions that Russia's Armed Forces do everything in their power to avoid hitting civilian infrastructure and avoid casualties among ordinary Ukrainians. Moscow and Kiev negotiated the establishment of humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from several cities, but Russian forces reported that in some areas, local nationalist battalions prevent people from leaving cities via the corridors and instead use them as human shields.

She and her husband stand at the gate to the front yard of their suburban home holding simple provisions that have just been delivered to them. These include fresh bread, grains, tea, coffee, and medicine. A few hours later, on the way back, the volunteers\u2019 car will return to an area with phone reception, and journalists will call the woman\u2019s relatives in Russia to tell them she\u2019s okay. This will be good news, as there have been no communication services in Volnovakha since fighting, once again, broke out there almost three weeks ago.The city is approximately halfway between Mariupol and Donetsk in a region recognised by Russia as belonging to the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). According to Western media outlets, and the online Wikipedia resource, it no longer exists. Indeed, the latter currently carries its obituary, saying: \"Volnovakha was a small city in Ukraine... before being destroyed during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the population of the city was 21,441.\"According to local sources, Kiev's forces had built substantial military fortifications on the outskirts of Volnovakha. However, the long trenches and deep dugouts are intact, having been untouched by the DPR's offensive. This would appear to back up assertions that the Ukrainians retreated to the town proper, perhaps with a view to preventing their opponents from using artillery or calling in air strikes. Of course, this meant that residential areas of the city bore the brunt of the fighting.\u00a0A little way into the town, there is a large sculpture with \u201cI \u2661 VOLNOVAKHA\u201d inscribed on it. On the heart between the two words, someone has spray-painted the letter Z, the symbol of Russia\u2019s military operation. There is a ruined church next to the inscription. Apparently, it fell into decay and began to collapse a few years ago. The same cannot be said for the rest of the city. It is badly damaged, and this has just happened recently.The first time I was in Volnovakha, the roads were littered with fallen trees and debris from buildings. Dead soldiers were still lying in some places, while destroyed military equipment and civilian cars crushed by tanks were evident\u00a0every now and then. Over the next couple of days, the corpses were removed, the roads were cleared, and the burned tanks and armored personnel carriers were shifted\u00a0to the side of the road. The DPR\u2019s Ministry of Emergency Situations has already begun to work on repairing some of the buildings, but there is a lot of work to be done.A significant proportion of the city\u2019s private homes have burned down or been destroyed by explosions. There are traces of shrapnel everywhere. The rare house may still have its fence or window panes intact. Many windows are sealed with plastic or boarded up. The words \u201cpeople live here\u201d are often found on the gates written in chalk. You often meet abandoned dogs on the street \u2013 both large yard dogs and expensive pets.Owners of houses can stoke a stove to warm up, fetch food from the cellar, and feed themselves for a while, but the inhabitants of multi-story buildings, of which there are many in Volnovakha, can\u2019t do this. One block lined with five-story buildings at the other end of the city can only be reached by maneuvering from side to side because the dirt road still contains unexploded landmines. These are currently fenced off with pieces of plywood and marked with red rags, waiting to be cleared.The apartment buildings are located a short distance from each other. They all have three entrances, and an improvised kitchen has been set up in front of each one. A kettle or a pot boils above a fire built within a circle of bricks. You can warm your hands by the fire. Among other humanitarian supplies, this district\u2019s residents are especially happy with candles. Because of the cold, they have to live in the basements of their buildings, and the lack of electricity forces them to sit in the dark.In one of the buildings, residents are trying to fix apartment windows as quickly as possible and hope for the arrival of spring. The battles for the city have left the basement uninhabitable. When a tank salvo hit the house, several floors collapsed, and the basement ceiling caved in. According to Vasily and Vladimir, who told this story, a Ukrainian tank opened fire on the building.They unlock the basement, and we go down. Daylight illuminates the room through the collapsed ceiling. Everything is covered in concrete dust and littered with debris. During the attack, the residents made it to the exit in time and no one was killed, but three people were injured. Vasily says the building was attacked on the morning of March 11. The first two shots missed, but the third hit, leading to the destruction. Vladimir says the shells came from the direction of the hostel, which has a well-stocked bomb shelter, unlike residential buildings. The fighters of the Ukrainian Armed Forces occupied it themselves after driving its residents out, and several tanks, armored personnel carriers, and military Humvees were placed around the building.\u201cWe put a grill on the street and were cooking meat with our grandchildren,\u201d says Vasily. \u201cTwo soldiers with the Ukrainian National Guard passed by and began to rudely ask why I wasn\u2019t fighting. I said something like, \u2018How am I going to fight at my age? And here, in the basement, I have children with grandchildren. Do I have to leave them and go somewhere to die? For what? For what idea?\u2019 The next day we were attacked.\u201dVladimir confirms that the Ukrainian military treated the local population with hostility. \u201cThey had a commander in their unit who boasted that he was a veteran, a hero of the so-called \u2018anti-terrorist operation\u2019 (the official name of Ukraine\u2019s military actions in the Donbass \u2013 RT). He said they were here to stay,\u201d he asserts. The DPR troops who came to the city did not know that people were hiding in the basements, as the Ukrainian side had reported that they had already been evacuated, Vasily says. At the same time, he claims it was actually impossible or even dangerous to evacuate. Few people wanted to leave for territory controlled by Kiev, and the Ukrainian military forbade them from heading for Donbass\u2019 pro-Russian republics. Vladimir also claims the Ukrainians deliberately shelled a nearby hospital in order to smoke people out.Tatyana accompanies me to the hospital. She has also lived in Volnovakha most of her life. \u201cThey deliberately destroyed us. They needed the land. And then, it seems, the land was no longer needed, so they just beat us out of anger,\u201d she says, pointing to holes blown into the hospital by shells and shrapnel-scarred asphalt. Then she takes me to the morgue, a small building that has also been noticeably damaged by shooting. The door turns out to be unlocked, and I see the morgue is completely filled with dead bodies. They lie in the corridor stacked up in two or three layers. According to Tatyana, the National Guard soldiers siphoned diesel fuel from the hospital\u2019s generators, so all the old people who depended on artificial ventilation devices died. The Ukrainian military allegedly said they would \u201cleave nothing\u201d in Volnovakha if they were ousted by pro-Russian forces.I can neither confirm nor disprove the reports of these alleged war crimes but, on the same day, I pass information about them to an expert from a public organization that deals with such incidents. The very next day, the testimony of Tatyana and her neighbors, as well as the hospital staff, was recorded by specialists. At the time of publication, no specific conclusions have been drawn.Tall fir trees stand in the park at the entrance to the hospital. They were badly damaged by shrapnel. The whole yard is littered with spruce branches, large and small. On the road, people are mostly on bicycles.\u00a0 This is now the main means of transportation here. Tatyana insists that the Ukrainian military deliberately attacked civilians. \u201cYou understand, the whole of Volnovakha is one huge war crime. These are sadists. I do not know where the world is looking, or why it doesn\u2019t want to see this!\u201d she says. After hearing our conversation, an elderly man on a Soviet bicycle with a bag of groceries slows down. He says a National Guard patrol shot at him just for fun, for no apparent reason. As confirmation, he points to a bullet hole in his bicycle\u2019s frame. I don\u2019t have time to ask his name before he continues on his way.There is a fresh grave a few meters from the entrance to one of the buildings. A homemade cross containing a surname, initials, and dates of birth and death has been placed right on top of a flowerbed there. This is the temporary burial place of a local resident who died in a huge fire that broke out in her apartment after a shell hit gas lines in her building.\u00a0 According to her neighbors, the woman was completely incinerated. Only her skull and a piece of her neck remained. It was decided that it was better to bury her remains than leave them lying in her apartment until the hostilities ended.\u00a0Nadezhda, one of her neighbors, takes me up to the third floor, where the apartment of the deceased is, or, more precisely, was. The explosion destroyed most of the interior walls, and the fire turned the living space into dusty ashes. Among the debris on the floor, broken dishes can be discerned, and a surviving porcelain figurine is visible \u2013 a Cossack in trousers and with a forelock. Going back down, I see that many other apartments have also been damaged. All were abandoned in a hurry. \u201cCivilians lived here, there were no soldiers... now everyone lives in the basement,\u201d Nadezhda says, almost crying.Humanitarian missions, both official and volunteer, come to Volnovakha almost every day. But despite their help, basements at the beginning of spring are still very cold, so volunteers are trying to take out the sick, elderly, and children. The RT humanitarian project removed two wheelchair users from a private house. A minibus specially driven in for this took them to a medical facility in Donetsk. And volunteers moved\u00a081-year-old Anatoly, Vladimir\u2019s father, who spoke to us in the basement.Anatoly takes a bag of warm clothes with him, as well as needed medicine. We set off for a village in Donetsk\u2019s suburbs, where his sister and niece live. When the fighting broke out, they had invited their relatives from Volnovakha to move in with them, but this became impossible very quickly. On the way back, I notice that houses which had appeared abandoned just a couple of days ago are beginning to show signs of habitation again.We stop in the city center near another hospital to drop off a box full of medicine and food. Doctors continue their work but lack sufficient supplies. Moreover, they have to work in the basement, as almost all of the windows in the building are broken. Entering it with volunteers, I notice an abundance of shell casings on the floor. There has been fighting here recently.The silence is broken by an explosion somewhere nearby, and then another. A soldier from the military commandant\u2019s office explains that it is the Ministry of Emergency Situations blowing up unexploded shells. A truck bearing the name of the same ministry is parked opposite us, loaded with the first batch of materials for repairing the buildings. While we are talking with the serviceman, a local resident approaches and informs him that he has found a machine gun in his yard. They leave together and soon return with the weapon. Judging by a sticker, it was thrown away by a fleeing Ukrainian soldier.After a short stay at the hospital, we take Anatoly to the outskirts of Donetsk, making a big detour. His sister and niece cry with joy and invite us in for tea, but, when we refuse, they produce a gift: a frozen chicken. At sunset, news arrives: telephone communication will soon be restored in Volnovakha, and Anatoly will be able to hear from the relatives who remain there. In the meantime, the rumble of artillery can be heard in Donetsk, urban combat continues in Mariupol, and the front still divides families."},{"uuid":"f8130f19-72bc-4b8c-ad1c-0d8a971d397b","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/business\/552224-india-buys-more-russian-oil\/","title":"India buys more Russian oil despite US threats","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6234703585f540570c0cabef.jpg","subtitle":"Country adopts \u2018pragmatic approach\u2019 to ensure energy security","content":"India\u2019s state-run refiner, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), has bought two million barrels of Russian oil for loading in May, as the country\u2019s refiners step up efforts to secure crude from Moscow at a discount, regional media reported on Thursday.The crude was sold by European trader Vitol and is the second such deal, as Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) purchased three million barrels of the Russian Urals crude earlier this week at a discount of $20-$25 a barrel for delivery in May.Another Indian company, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), has also reportedly floated a tender for one million barrels of the same benchmark.Some countries have reportedly been avoiding buying Russian oil in fear of retaliatory sanctions from the US.

In an interview released by the ministry on Monday, Mi-24 commander Oleg Esman explained that the incident took place as a group of Russian combat helicopters cleared a Ukrainian airfield to ensure the landing of Russian paratroopers from Mi-8 transport choppers. Referring to his Mi-24 helicopter facing a frontal attack, the Russian pilot said that he saw a Stinger missile fly literally \"toward his forehead\", adding that he actually had no time to make a decision. Even though the missile damaged the tail of the helicopter, the Mi-24 was able to continue firing, something that helped it go ahead with the mission of clearing the Ukrainian airfield. With its fuselage fitted with thick armour plates, the Mi-24 is nicknamed the \"flying tank\" for the helicopter's ability to take hits and keep flying. The nickname is also a tribute to the World War II-era Soviet Il-2 ground-attack aircraft that terrified Nazi troops over its capacity to continue fighting despite massive damage to its fuselage. The Russian Defence Ministry has since said that Russian Ka-52 and Mi-28N helicopters destroyed 15 more Ukrainian armoured vehicles during strikes in the early hours of Monday. According to Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov, the vehicles included 8 tanks, 4 infantry fighting vehicles, and 3 armoured personnel carriers, as part of Russia's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine. President Putin ordered the start of the operation on 24 February following a request from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) to protect them from attacks by Ukrainian forces.  He stated that Russia was left with no other choice but to intervene to help the newly-recognised Donbass republics. He described the goals of the operation as the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine and vowed that the Russian armed forces will only be targeting military objectives.

The EU has been collaborating closely with the United States amid widespread mainstream western denunciations of the ongoing Russian special military operation aimed at demilitarizing and denazifying Ukraine, which was spurred by near-continuous attacks on Russian-speaking communities in eastern Ukraine which has killed well over 10,000 people since 2014.

On Tuesday, US Senators unveiled legislation under which wealthy Russians\u2019 assets could be seized and auctioned off, with the profits also benefiting the Ukrainian regime. The \u201cAsset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act\u201d would allow the US government to take and sell assets valued at over $2 million from not just Russians slapped with US sanctions but also \u201cforeigners linked to the Russian government,\u201d according to Forbes. While the legislation currently stipulates the proceeds from the sale of such ill-gotten goods would be used \"only for the benefit of the people of Ukraine,\" Forbes notes this category would include \u201cmilitary assistance.\u201d By all indications, Kiev needs it. Amid what Forbes described as \u201cgrowing concern about Ukraine\u2019s ability to sustain its military operations and provide services to its citizens.\u201d But with the ongoiing operation, it\u2019s unclear whether such funds will make much of an impact on the current balance of forces. As US government-funded outlet VOA News noted, \u201cInvestigations,\u201d into accused offenders \u201ccan drag on for months and years.\u201d "},{"uuid":"fd2edc80-1901-4646-be60-b019a1cef696","url":"https:\/\/sputniknews.com\/20220322\/biden-calls-russias-hypersonic-missiles-consequential-says-theyre-almost-impossible-to-stop-1094088902.html","title":"Biden Calls Russia\u2019s Hypersonic Missiles \u2018Consequential\u2019, Says They\u2019re \u2018Almost Impossible to Stop\u2019","image":"https:\/\/cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com\/img\/106240\/72\/1062407230_0:0:1770:1036_1440x900_80_0_1_cddf15ccc8365dbd26cf96d3031d859c.jpg?source-sid=","subtitle":"Russia became the first country in the world to achieve modern hypersonic capability after putting the Kinzhal (\u201cDagger\u201d) nuclear-capable air-to-ground missile system into service in late 2017.

The first strike targeted a fortified underground missile and ammo depot in Delyatin, Ivano-Frankivsk region. The facility was built in the Soviet period and designed to withstand a nuclear blast. The second strike destroyed a fuel and lubricant base in Konstantinovka, Nikolaev region which the Russian military said served as the main supply base used by Ukrainian ground forces in southern Ukraine. First introduced into service in December 2017 and carried on board MiG-31K jets or Tu-22 and Tu-160 bombers, the Kinzhal has a range of over 2,000 km and a top speed of up to Mach 12 (14,700 km per hour). It is also said to have the capability to manoeuvre in flight, making it next to impossible to intercept using any currently existing air defences. The Russian military has reported on the destruction of over 90 percent of Ukraine\u2019s air defence capabilities in the course of its ongoing military operation in the country. The United States and its allies have sought to shore up Kiev\u2019s air defences using S-300s and other Soviet-era systems.

It is thought that bidders with experience in property investment are involved, with this being considered a benefit as the club looks to build a new stadium far in excess of the capacity of their current Stamford Bridge ground which holds just over 41,000 people.Bidders are also understood to be required to rubber-stamp guarantees of \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion) in future investment, which is thought to be a fund to guarantee that player investment will continue at a similar pace as it did throughout the Abramovich era.Once the final bids are received on April 11, it is thought that the full takeover could be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of that month.The successful bidder will also be required to be approved by the UK government, who have imposed a litany of financial restrictions on Chelsea following Abramovich's sanctioning given that the club is considered to be one of the Russian's numerous assets.\u00a0It is also thought that Abramovich will have an influence over the winning bid.Several of the interested parties have a wealth of experience at the helm of successful US-based sports franchises.American financiers Josh Harris and Dave Blitzer have backed a bid by the UK's Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Sebastien Coe, with the US duo already holding a stake in\u00a0NBA team the Philadelphia 76ers and NHL outfit\u00a0the New Jersey Devils.Sacramento Kings owner\u00a0Vivek Ranadive is also said to be interested, as is\u00a0LA Dodgers owner Todd Boehly, as well as a handful of others.However, an offer\u00a0Chicago Cubs chief\u00a0Tom Ricketts has proved unpopular with the Stamford Bridge faithful amid reports that his father Joe had previously been involved in sending Islamaphobic emails.\u00a0"},{"uuid":"fef4da54-df4f-4722-b11c-0d3093de8ca7","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/552939-chechen-mariupol-nemtsov-killing\/","title":"Rumored suspect in Russian opposition figure murder wounded in Ukraine","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/6243602385f5401dfe0a782b.png","subtitle":"A Chechen commander linked by some people to the killing of Boris Nemtsov is recovering in hospital","content":"Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov posted a video on Tuesday visiting Ruslan Geremeev in hospital.

He was never formally charged with any crime related to the hit.A lawyer representing Nemtsov\u2019s family claimed that Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee decided against filing an injunction due to shortage of evidence against him.The US blamed Geremeev for Nemtsov\u2019s death and placed him on the sanctions list in 2019, offering no evidence of his involvement.Chechen units have taken part in the fighting for Mariupol, a coastal city in southeastern Ukraine which has long been the stronghold of \u201cAzov,\u201d the Ukrainian regiment openly using Nazi insignia.Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following Ukraine\u2019s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements signed in 2014, and Russia\u2019s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk.

By the standards of history, this area has emerged quite recently, and has always stood a little apart. It\u2019s important to understand its evolution when viewing this crisis, which began in 2014.\u00a0Today, Donbass is an industrial and mining region, but for a long time it was largely uninhabited. The steppe zone that ran along the southern borders of medieval \u2018Rus\u2019 (not yet divided into Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus) was called the \u2018Wild Fields.\u2019 It was home to nomadic peoples and farmers only moved south with great difficulty. After the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, the Wild Fields\u00a0 was a dangerous place to find yourself.\u00a0Around four hundred years, a few peasants from Russia and Ukraine began to gradually settle in the future Donbass.A great leap forward came in the 19th century when the coal deposits discovered there became necessary for industry. It was then that many of the cities without which it is impossible to imagine today\u2019s Donbass were founded. In 1869, the British industrialist John Hughes built a factory around which the village of Yuzovka grew \u2013 it had a few more names, including Stalino,\u00a0 before a local man renamed it Donetsk, in 1961.His name was Nikita Khruschev, and he had risen from humble origins as a metal fitter to lead the Soviet Union.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1868, Kramatorsk appeared and, in 1878, Debaltseve. The cities grew rapidly. Coal deposits and increasing factories formed the unique \u2018face\u2019 of the region. This even applies to the landscape: wherever you go in modern Donbass, giant landfills catch your eye. Donbass was formed as an industrial region and its cities and factories often flow into one another, even today. The region was inhabited by several streams of colonists from Russia and Ukraine and its population was very diverse, but its peoples mixed easily due to the proximity of their languages and cultures.\u00a0It was meteoric development in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it became a huge mine and forge for the Russian Empire, that made it the Donbass we know today.A great deal changed in 1917. Two revolutions and a civil war divided the history of the whole of Russia into \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after.\u2019After the February Revolution, when the monarchy fell, a Provisional Committee ruled the region. Meanwhile, the Central Rada in Kiev declared Ukraine autonomous, before making a declaration of independence after the October Revolution. The Rada made broad territorial claims, which included the territory of Donbass. However, not entirely so. Yuzovka was a border city, according to the Rada\u2019s stipulations. The nuance was that the Rada did not exercise any authority over most of these territories, and it soon was quarreling with the Provisional Government in Petrograd.The whole argument could have been quashed in parliamentary debates but, on November 7, 1917, the socialist revolution took place. After that, events took off at a gallop. In Kiev, the Communist uprising was suppressed, and Russian officers, who considered the Rada a lesser evil than the Reds, actively participated.\u00a0Meanwhile, in the east of the self-proclaimed Ukraine, a very unusual coalition was being formed. Its center was Kharkov, a large industrial city that was not part of the Donetsk Basin region but closely tied to it. The Donbass\u2019 distinct identity had already emerged by that time. Although the area was administratively divided into three entities, they had a common economy and interests. While the Rada was in session, local councils in the east of Ukraine announced the unification of the Donbass and Krivbass coal basins. It also included cities belonging to the region of the Don Cossack Army, such as Mariupol and Krivoy Rog, which was administratively part of the Kherson province, as well as Kharkov. This structure, which was informally called \u2018Donkrivbass\u2019 or simply \u2018Donbass,\u2019 did not claim independence and deemed the idea of separating from Russia absurd, considering itself, instead autonomous within it. Moreover, Ukraine\u2019s independence projects were of no interest to it creators.Nikolai von Ditmar, chairman of the Council of Congresses of Miners of the South of Russia, noted:\"Industrially, geographically, and practically speaking, this whole area is completely different from that of Kiev. This whole district has its own completely independent fundamental importance for Russia and lives a separate life. The administrative subordination of the Kharkov district to Kiev is not called for by anything at all, but on the contrary, does not correspond with reality. Such artificial subordination will only complicate and impede the life of the district, especially since this subordination is dictated by questions of expediency and state requirements, and exclusively by the national claims of the leaders of the Ukrainian movement.\"In February of 1918, Fyodor Sergeyev, a Bolshevik known by the party pseudonym Artyom, proclaimed the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic (DKR) to be an autonomous region within the RSFSR, or Soviet Russia.\u00a0\u00a0Was the DKR legitimate? No more and no less than any other self-proclaimed entity formed on the ruins of the Russian Empire, where states proclaimed their independence and then collapsed in a week. Another example was \u201cGreen Ukraine,\u201d an attempt to found an independent Ukrainian state, near the Pacific Ocean. That project centered around the city of Khabarovsk, which today is a 8,924km drive from Kiev.\u00a0The DKR project was not the idea of the leadership of the Bolshevik Party. It appeared precisely on the basis of a regional identity that had already been formed. The leader Vladimir Lenin knew of the upcoming creation of the DKR and did not object. The borders Artyom claimed for the republic were more modest than those drawn by the Rada, but still very wide. The DKR\u2019s problem was the same as the Rada\u2019s \u2013 actual control over the territory was very tenuous or nonexistent. The DKR had its own government, which included representatives of three left-wing parties \u2013 the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, and Social Revolutionaries. Some of its legislation\u2019s nuances appear very unusual and mild by the standards of the time and place. For example, the death penalty was officially banned there. In general, Artyom and his team had a reputation among the Bolsheviks as soft-hearted liberals who hindered repression and released the \u2018bourgeois\u2019 from prison.In short, by the standards of civil war-torn Russia, the DKR was a real stronghold of humanity. In reality, everything was not going as smoothly as the creators of the republic would have liked. For example, arbitrary reprisals were prohibited but the local authorities secretly practiced them. However, the general trend was more lenient than in other places.The main problem was that Artyom and his comrades could not hold on to power. The German army, which was continuing its offensive during the First World War, was rolling in from the west, and Berlin\u2019s forces destroyed the DKR by May of 1918.Donbass and all of Russia collapsed into the abyss. At first, the Germans plundered the region. Then it became the scene of battles between the Reds and Whites \u2013 the main sides in the civil war.However, Donbass\u2019 \u2018distinctiveness\u2019 had not disappeared. The debate over how to deal with the area continued until 1923. The region\u2019s place in the new order was not at all obvious. Its cities were mostly Russian in both language and self-identification. However, the occupying German forces installed a collaborationist Ukrainian government. Both Germans and Ukrainians shot political opponents and those suspected of sympathizing with the Reds. At the same time, the Ukrainian government began to implement a policy of \u2018Ukrainization\u2019 \u2013 an attempt to impose its own language and identity on the local population. One of its first orders read:\u00a0\u201cIn all state institutions of the Kharkov region, all business should be conducted only in the Ukrainian language.\u201d Another requirement was \u201cfor all institutions to replace all writing on signs, posters, and announcements with the Ukrainian language within three days... The statements from leaders claiming that it is impossible to replace the writing in three days are not considered convincing because there are already some establishments that have fulfilled this order... If signs, posters, announcements, etc have not been replaced with those containing the state language within the stipulated period, then the designated heads of districts, transportation departments, and post offices will be severely punished according to the laws of the Ukrainian People\u2019s Republic.\u201dThese attempts were unsuccessful for a banal reason: there were not enough experts in Ukrainian to introduce the language in schools and offices. The situation reached the level of comedy when the head of the Ukrainization commission greeted subordinates in Ukrainian, after which everyone switched to Russian.\u00a0After the defeat of Germany in the First World War, Donbass was easily cleared of Ukrainian formations, and the real struggle began \u2013 between the Reds and the Whites. However, the issue of Donbass\u2019 status remained in question.\u00a0Neither the Reds nor the Whites recognized any independent Ukrainian states. The Bolsheviks, however, welcomed the creation of Ukraine, but only a strictly Red one. Whatever the desires of the Rada, it could not secure its claims by force of arms, and authority on the ruins of Russia could only be imposed at gunpoint.Artyom insisted that the region should be part of Soviet Russia, basing his argument on economic ties and the language of the population. However, this idea was torpedoed by none other than Lenin, who instantly scoffed at the idea of recreating the DKR, declaring it \u201cplaying with independence.\u201d The logic on which the Soviet leaders based Donbass\u2019 inclusion in Ukraine is interesting:\u201cSeparating the Kharkov and Yekaterinoslav (today Dnepropetrovsk) provinces from Ukraine will create a petty-bourgeois peasant republic and lead to perpetual fear that the peasant majority will gain the advantage at some other Congress of Soviets, because the only purely proletarian districts are the mining areas of the Donetsk basin and Zaporozhye.\u201dThe Bolsheviks, who were supported mainly by workers, literally hammered the region into Ukraine precisely because the industrial region was very different from the rest of the republic. Artyom died in a railway accident in 1921 and, of course, couldn\u2019t have prevented this. Donbass was incorporated into Soviet Ukraine without any special status, and a campaign of \u2018indigenization\u2019 was launched in the region. Soviet ideology called for the culture, language, and traditions of the people who were considered indigenous to this republic to be literally implanted in the national republics. The USSR, especially in the early days, maintained a kind of governmental \u2018affirmative action\u2019 policy. One of the leaders of the nascent Soviet Union, Nikolai Bukharin, formulated the task as follows:\u00a0\u201cOne cannot even approach this from the point of view of equality of nations, and Lenin has repeatedly proved this. On the contrary, we must say that we, as a former great-power nation, must... put ourselves in an unequal position by making even greater concessions to national tendencies... Only with such a policy, when we artificially put ourselves in a lower position compared to others, only at this price can we buy ourselves the real trust of formerly oppressed nations.\u201dThe Ukrainization of Donbass was carried out systematically, and with the rigidity typical of the USSR. All mention of times when the region was autonomous were banned, there was an attempt to introduce the Ukrainian language everywhere, and, in 1930, a number of university teachers were arrested for refusing to switch to the Ukrainian language and adopt \u2018Ukrainian culture.\u2019 The Ukrainization of the press, education, and culture continued until the second half of the decade, when Joseph Stalin took national policy in different direction.\u00a0However, Donbass\u2019 distinctiveness, although somewhat faded, had not completely disappeared. The region\u2019s way of life still significantly differed from that in the rest of Ukraine. The industrial, Russian-speaking and largely ethnically Russian region retained its distinct character both during the era of incredible upheavals in the first half of the 20th century and the stagnant times of the late USSR. And it has, likewise, been preserved since the Soviet Union collapsed, in 1991."},{"uuid":"ffc94fc0-8cec-40cd-a80f-c3228feb93de","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/shows\/documentary\/553005-azov-battalion-donbass-residents\/","title":"Ukraine: Heading East","image":null,"subtitle":"nan","content":"Donbass residents have fled southeast Ukraine after eight years of shelling and destruction by Ukrainian government forces.

It has already led to a global economic crisis stemming from disruptions in supply chains and rising energy prices. And although the beginning of the hostilities came as a surprise to the whole world, the current state of affairs was not unpredictable \u2013 international relations experts have been warning about the risk of this escalation for the past 30 years.Why didn\u2019t politicians in the West\u00a0listen to their advice, instead of allowing war to break out in Europe, and fuel and food prices to skyrocket at home? RT explains.\u201cI want to make it clear to everyone, both in our country and abroad, to our partners, that it\u2019s not even about the line that we don\u2019t want anyone to cross. The fact is that we have nowhere to retreat. They have pinned us against a line from which, sorry for the bad manners, we have nowhere to retreat,\u201d President Vladimir Putin stated at the end of December 2021, almost two months before he ordered the assault on Ukraine.\u00a0At the time, Moscow was trying to come to an agreement with NATO on mutual security, hoping that the US-led bloc would agree to provide comprehensive written guarantees that it would not expand any further, to the east. Not only Putin, but also other Russian officials, talked about \u2018red lines\u2019 that posed a serious threat, with ominous consequences for the world, if crossed.The existence of these red lines \u2013 most notably against NATO expansion into Ukraine \u2013 is not some subjective concept born in the minds of Russia\u2019s current leadership. Oddly enough, they were being discussed in the West long before they became the subject of conversation in the Kremlin.\u00a0In 1998, George Kennan, an American diplomat and historian known as the \u2018architect of the Cold War\u2019, said NATO expansion would mean nothing less than \u201cthe beginning of a new Cold War,\u201d warning that it would be a \u201ctragic mistake.\u201d\u00a0\u201cOf course, this will provoke a bad reaction from Russia. And when that happens, [those who made decisions about NATO expansion] will say that we have always told you the Russians are like that. But it\u2019s just not true,\u201d he said.In 1997, 50 prominent foreign policy experts, including former senators, military leaders, and diplomats, sent an open letter to then-President Bill Clinton outlining their opposition to NATO expansion. \u201cIt is a policy error of historic proportions,\u201d they wrote.Conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan wrote in his 1999 book \u2018A Republic, Not an Empire\u2019, \u201cBy moving NATO onto Russia\u2019s front porch, we have scheduled a twenty-first-century confrontation.\u201dThe current director of the CIA, William Burns, said in 2008 that for Russia, \u201cUkraine\u2019s accession to NATO is the brightest of all red lines.\u201d\u201cI have not yet found anyone who would consider Ukraine in NATO as something other than a direct challenge to Russia\u2019s interests,\u201d he said.These are just some of the statements made by major American political figures, but it would be possible to compile an entire book from forecasts made in the 1990s alone. And after the Ukraine crisis began in 2014, and Russia\u2019s subsequent reabsorption of Crimea, opinions about the folly of further NATO expansion were heard more and more often in the West.\u00a0Over the past eight years, former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, Henry Kissinger, famed American scholar of Russian studies Stephen Cohen, and many other experts have issued warnings about NATO expansion.The decisions made by Western government officials over the past 20-25 years have clearly contradicted the recommendations of these experts.\u00a0Timofei Bordachev, the program director of the Valdai International Discussion Club and academic director of the Center for Integrated European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, believes the reason for this is obvious \u2013 politicians listen to experts, but don\u2019t consider it necessary to follow their recommendations.\u201cIn an area like international relations, politicians, unfortunately, almost never listen to the expert community. The reason for this is understandable. The task of the expert community is to achieve peace and prevent conflict. But since politicians answer to the voters, they always work to achieve victory at any cost,\u201d Bordachev said in a conversation with RT.\u201cThe difference in approach is obvious. Therefore, it is very difficult for politicians to listen to the opinion of experts. In achieving their goals, they bluff to the last,\u201d he added.This hypothesis is most clearly confirmed in an interview with the adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Alexey Arestovich, which was given to the Apostrophe TV YouTube channel in 2019. At the time, he not only accurately predicted the year war would break out in his country and the reasons behind it, but also asserted that conflict was inevitable, indicating that it was necessary for Ukraine:\u201cWith a 99.9% probability, our price of joining NATO is a big war with Russia... The optimal outcome is a major war with Russia and a transition to NATO based on the results of victory over Russia.\u201dThese words suggest that Ukraine\u2019s leadership was not intent on preventing war at all. On the contrary, the country was preparing for war, believing it was a justifiable means of achieving \u2018victory\u2019 \u2013 joining NATO.However, this does not explain why American, or at least European, politicians did not try to prevent the war in Europe. According to Bordachev, the fact is that Western leaders proceeded from the assumption that there was no way their countries could join the war.\u201cGiven the existence of nuclear deterrence, everyone understands the risk of a general destructive war is very easily separated from all other risks: it is easy to localize and prevent. We can see this now from the behavior of the United States and its allies, who are taking all measures against Russia short of direct intervention in the conflict. That is, they very confidently exclude from the equation a scenario that would pose a danger to themselves \u2013 they are not suicidal. But Western politicians do not care at all about how many Ukrainians must die in order for them to achieve their goals,\u201d Bordachev said.Dmitry Suslov, the deputy director for research at the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy (CFDP) and deputy director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies of the Faculty of World Economy and International Affairs of the National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics (NRU HSE), believes there is a different reason why the actions of politicians deviate so much from what the expert community prescribes.It\u2019s not that Western politicians refuse to listen to foreign policy analysts \u2013 they listen to the wrong ones.\u201cThere was no unity among the experts in the West, no consensus at all. It was mainly the foreign policy realists from the US and Europe that had warned about the dangers of expanding NATO. The problem was, after the end of the Cold War, the realists\u2019 influence in the Western foreign policy establishment has diminished significantly,\u201d Suslov told RT.According to him, once the Cold War ended, the liberal viewpoint quickly gained popularity among Western expert circles and policymakers. \u201cThe idea was, first off, that Russia was in a state of impending and irreversible decline, and that it wouldn\u2019t dare challenge the West in any shape or form. It was believed that Russia would eventually fall in line and join the \u2018right side of history\u2019 (from the West\u2019s point of view), would fit into the NATO-centric paradigm in Europe and take on a subordinate position on the sidelines of global politics. This was the vision espoused by liberals and neoconservatives, and it clearly dominated over the realists\u2019 position,\u201d he said.This only seemed natural. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many had the feeling that the balance of power and the previous patterns of international relations suddenly became obsolete. Now, they thought, everything would be different \u2013 international relations would be guided by a brand-new set of considerations, while those of the realists, along with their notions of geopolitics, would fade away into obscurity.The \u2018end of history\u2019, a concept advocated by Francis Fukuyama in the 1990s, gained a lot of traction during this period. It is well known that Fukuyama\u2019s interpretation of this idea had a powerful influence on George W. Bush and his foreign policy. In his book titled \u2018The End of History and the Last Man\u2019, he announced that the age of ideological confrontation, authoritarianism, revolutions, and war was finally over, as all states would eventually embrace liberal democracy modeled after the United States.Fukuyama is now making predictions about the outcome of the current conflict in Ukraine. He believes that military defeat for Russia in Ukraine is imminent and will result in China not daring to invade Taiwan. This, according to Fukuyama, will revive the spirit of 1989, which will capture people\u2019s hearts and bring the world back to the path towards the \u2018end of history\u2019.Truth be told, Russia gave Western politicians reasons to doubt the assessments of realist experts.\u00a0\u201cIn the 1990s and even early 2000s, Russia appeared weak. It didn\u2019t stand determinately and clearly enough against expansion of NATO; moreover, it made the expansion even easier to some extent,\u201d Suslov said.In his opinion, the very existence of the Founding Act signed in 1997 convinced the West that Moscow was ready to turn a blind eye to NATO expansion.\u00a0This document determined Russia-NATO relations over the past 25 years, until the start of Russia\u2019s attack on\u00a0Ukraine. It reaffirmed the commitment of the parties to the inherent right of European nations \u201cto choose the means to ensure their own security.\u201d\u00a0For years, this formula was used by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to explain why Russia did not have a say in Georgia or Ukraine joining the alliance.\u201cIndeed, Russia had secured several important provisions in that document, but at the same time, it gave a signal that a deal on expansion is possible. In general, the act showed Russia wouldn\u2019t wage war against NATO or acceding states,\u201d Suslov said.The Founding Act gave the alliance legal grounds for admitting new members, but what really assured Western politicians that Russia was ready to allow expansion was the accession of the former Soviet republics of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.Curiously enough, when this discussion was just beginning in 1997, Joe Biden, then-chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, argued that Russia could go along with NATO accepting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into the military bloc, but the Baltic states were where it would draw the line.\u00a0\u201cI think the one place where the greatest consternation would be caused in the short-term would be to admit the Baltic states now,\u201d the future US president said.In the end, the Baltic states were admitted into the alliance. They received invitations in 2002, and in 2004 became full members.\u00a0\u201cHow did Russia react? It did nothing again. It really stood up against expansion only when NATO tried to extend to Georgia and Ukraine. That\u2019s why we ended up where we are now,\u201d Suslov said.Reality has clearly changed. The current dynamics of relations between Russia and the West leaves no ambiguity about NATO\u2019s potential advance toward Russia\u2019s borders.According to Suslov, this, along with other trends observed in contemporary international relations, will strengthen the position of the realists.\u201cThere is no doubt we are now witnessing a resurgence of the realist school. This has to do not only with the conflict in Ukraine, but also with the confrontation between the US and China. Once again, we see that the shifts in the balance of power on the globe are the single most important factor \u2013 it is what sets everything in motion and shapes the international system. It is a new shift in the balance of global powers that dictates the state of relations between nations: China has become too strong, and the US is trying to contain it,\u201d he said.Suslov argues that the current patterns in US-China relations \u201cspell doom for the liberals and hold a lot of promise for realists. It is quite likely that, in the near future, Western politicians will start making decisions based on advice from the latter and not the former. If so, then what do the realists propose as their solution to the ongoing conflict in Europe?\"\u201cThe realists argue that the US should recognize Ukraine\u2019s geopolitical losses as \u2018status quo\u2019, stop supplying Kiev with lethal weapons and even pressure Zelensky into signing a deal with Moscow under which Ukraine would remain independent but neutral.\u201dFollowing these recommendations would help the US solve two important problems, Suslov said. First of all, Washington could stop further Russia-China rapprochement unfavorable to the US. Secondly, it would de-escalate US-Russia tensions by preventing direct military confrontation between the nations.\u201cRealists believe this kind of confrontation is on the table if Washington continues the economic war against Moscow,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any case, it\u2019s too early to dismiss negative scenarios as unlikely and trust in the good judgment of politicians. According to Bordachev, \u201cNot once in the history of humankind have politicians listened to experts. And there are no hints this could change today.\u201d"},{"uuid":"53bc8f3f-31f2-4816-a4c1-c408b6ecd5b6","url":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/russia\/553067-ukraine-biolabs-hunter-biden-documents\/","title":"Russia presents new evidence on Ukraine biolabs, comments on links to Biden and US","image":"https:\/\/mf.b37mrtl.ru\/files\/2022.03\/xxs\/62460a6285f5400f214a83e8.jpg","subtitle":"Documents detail fate of US-funded deadly pathogens that may have been tested on Ukrainians","content":"The Russian military has presented documents\u00a0showing Ukraine\u2019s interest in using drones to deliver weaponized pathogens developed in US-funded biolabs. Names of US officials involved in the biolabs projects, and the role the current US president\u2019s son played in the program, were also made public during the special briefing on Thursday.One of the key pieces of evidence was a letter from the Ukrainian company Motor Sich to the\u00a0 Turkish drone manufacturer Baykar Makina \u2013 makers of the Bayraktar TB2 and Akinci UAVs \u2013 dated December 15, 2021. The Ukrainians specifically asked if the drones could carry 20 liters of aerosolized payload to a range of 300 kilometers \u2013 putting them in range of a dozen major Russian cities and almost all of Belarus.\u00a0\u201cWe are talking about the development by the Kiev regime of technical means of delivery and use of biological weapons with the possibility of their use against the Russian Federation,\u201d said Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, commander of the Russian Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Forces.Kirillov also referenced a US patent (No. 8,967,029) for a mechanism to deploy aerosolized pathogens from a drone. The US response to a 2018 Russian inquiry about this patent did not deny its existence, but claimed that it technically did not violate Washington\u2019s obligations under the treaties banning chemical and biological weapons, he pointed out.Kirillov showed signed contracts between US government agencies \u2013 Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the Pentagon, the Department of State \u2013 and the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, as well as the specific facilities inside Ukraine. The Pentagon spent more than $30 million for biological research at just one Ukrainian facility, the Public Health Center of the Ministry of Health, according to the Russian military.DTRA official Robert Pope was \u201cone of the key figures\u201d in the program, and \u201cthe author of the idea of creating a central depository of especially dangerous microorganisms in Kiev,\u201d Kirillov said. The Pentagon\u2019s biological projects in Ukraine were coordinated by Joanna Wintrol, head of the DTRA office in Kiev, until she left in August 2020. She directly supervised projects UP-4, UP-6, and UP-8 to study deadly pathogens, including anthrax, the Congo-Crimean fever, and leptospirosis, according to Kirillov.The US agency\u2019s point of contact was Ukraine\u2019s Health Minister (2016-2019) Ulyana Suprun, herself a US citizen, Kirillov noted, while a major go-between was the private contractor Black and Veatch, whose Kiev office was headed by Lance Lippencott. Another Pentagon contractor, Metabiota, also had a role in the project.Kirillov said that Hunter Biden \u2013 son of the current US President Joe Biden \u2013 played \u201can important role in creating a financial opportunity to work with pathogens on the territory of Ukraine,\u201d pointing to several emails between him and executives of Metabiota and Black and Veatch. In particular, he described the Metabiota VP as \u201ca confidant of Hunter Biden,\u201d based on\u00a0 their correspondence. According to the general, the \u201cWestern media\u201d has confirmed the authenticity of these emails \u2013 presumably a reference to materials published last week by the British newspaper the Daily Mail.Even Kiev was concerned about the biolabs, according to a memo Kirillov showed. A 2017 letter from the Kherson department of the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) said that DTRA and Black and Veach intend to \u201cestablish control over the functioning of microbiological laboratories in Ukraine conducting research on pathogens of particularly dangerous infections that can be used to create or modernize new types of biological weapons.\u201dPointing to a June 2019 document from the Public Health Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, Kirillov wondered why it insisted on secrecy and required that \u201cserious\u201d incidents \u201cincluding the death of the subjects\u201d had to be reported to the US bioethics authorities within 24 hours \u2013 when other documents about that specific program only reference standard blood sampling work.\u201cWe do not exclude that the official research program is only the \u2018visible part of the iceberg\u2019, while in practice, volunteers were infected with the Congo\u2013Crimean fever virus, hantaviruses and the causative agent of leptospirosis,\u201d the general said, accusing the US of \u201ca dismissive attitude towards the citizens of Ukraine,\u201d and treating them as guinea pigs for biological and medical experimentation.The US has long claimed that allegations about Pentagon-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine were \u201cRussian disinformation.\u201d Earlier this month, however, US diplomat Victoria Nuland testified before the Senate that \u201cbiological research laboratories in Ukraine\u201d did exist, and that Washington was working with Kiev \u201cto ensure that the materials of biological research do not fall into the hands of Russian forces.\u201dAccording to Kirillov, all pathogenic biomaterials stored in Ukraine were \u201ctransported by military transport aircraft to the United States via Odessa,\u201d in early February 2022. On February 24, as Russian troops entered Ukraine, the ministry of health in Kiev ordered the remaining strains to be destroyed, the general said.Kirillov said that the Russian intervention halted activities at five Ukrainian biolabs that had been working with anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, cholera, leptospirosis, and African swine fever."}]
